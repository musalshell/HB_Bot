0:34

0:36
for you one for each year of my indie
0:38
publishing so I hope that you'll stick
0:40
around and subscribe to this channel hit
0:42
that notification bell so that you'll
0:43
get notified every time there's a new
0:45
video from me but let's get started with
0:48
tip number 5 which is that you cannot do
0:50
it all oh man guys this is a tough one
The Process
0:58
not just when it comes to all of the
1:01
things that we have to do like sometimes
1:04
you don't realize when you sign up for
1:07
this whole self publishing in Deker ear
1:09
you may not realize because I did it at
1:12
the beginning that you are actually
1:13
signing up to be an entrepreneur to be
1:16
the CEO of your own little publishing
1:18
business first of all you have to come
1:20
up with all the ideas all the strategies
1:22
figure out what you're going to write
1:23
you have to know how to plot you have to
1:25
write the books which takes time and a
1:27
lot of skill and effort and learning
1:30
that's involved in that then you've got
1:32
to edit your books you have to find and
1:34
hire a professional editor you have to
1:36
be a art director because even if you
1:39
find a really great cover artist you
1:41
have to be the one to direct them on
1:43
what type of cover you want what types
1:45
of fonts you want used you have to know
1:47
where you're putting that book in the
1:49
store you know it's no publisher is
1:52
going to tell you well this is a romance
1:53
and this is an urban fantasy versus a
1:55
contemporary fantasy or whatever you
1:57
have to know that because you're the
1:59
publisher so you have to understand
2:01
where your book gets placed how it gets
2:03
marketed to readers what kind of blurb
2:05
you want to put or description what
2:07
keywords are go on that book and I could
2:09
just go on and on and on not to mention
2:11
pricing and how you're going to
2:13
at the book long-term and your back list
2:15
and whether you're gonna do paperbacks
2:17
or you know audible books or whatever
2:19
audiobooks there is so much that goes
2:22
into being a self-published author and
2:25
you know it's it goes way beyond just
2:28
writing the books and putting them up on
2:29
Amazon or Google Play or iBooks or
2:32
wherever there's so much more that goes
2:33
into this process and each genre has its
2:38
own quirks every vendor has its own
2:40
quirks and rules like Kobo books has
2:42
this really great interface where you
2:45
can apply for promotions it's one of my
2:47
favorite things about that bender and
2:48
one of the reasons that I highly
2:50
recommend that you choose to go wide
2:52
with your career but that is a
2:54
discussion for another day but if you go
2:57
to Google Play Books they don't have
2:59
that promotions list for you if you go
3:01
to Amazon you know you just get picked
3:03
for promotions or not and pretty much
3:05
the only promotions that are available
3:06
are available to people who are
3:07
exclusive but there are lots of
3:11
different quirks about every single
3:12
publisher the royalty rates are
3:14
different the Terms of Service are
3:16
different and there's just a lot of
3:18
things that you need to know and then on
The ToDo List
3:20
top of all this information that you
3:22
need to learn and you need to know to
3:23
run your business most efficiently and
3:26
to the best of your ability there's also
3:28
a lot of things that you need to do like
3:31
if you were to sit down even eight years
3:35
in successfully making six figures a
3:37
year for the past several years if I
3:39
were to sit down and make a to-do list
3:41
right now it would probably blow your
3:43
mind because there is not only all these
3:46
little things to learn which I have
3:47
learned a lot of over the years but
3:49
there are also a jillion things to do if
3:52
I want to be on all the different social
3:54
media outlets and be posting every day
3:56
and they each have their own things and
3:57
do I want to run insta stories and you
3:59
know I've got to get my paperbacks
4:00
updated and I just had a new release so
4:02
I need to go back to my old back list
4:04
and update those ebooks to put the links
4:06
in and you know there's just so many
4:09
things you wouldn't even think about so
4:11
what you need to understand and the
4:15
faster you can get this and really
4:17
master this the better off you're going
4:19
to be both emotionally and you know just
4:21
in your business period is that the
4:24
secret to doing it all is knowing that
4:27
you
4:27
can't there is literally no way unless
4:29
you just happen to be independently
4:32
wealthy or you have built your career up
4:34
to such a point that you have five
4:35
assistants and a CFO and whatever you've
4:38
got a whole staff working for you unless
4:40
you're at that level and if you are you
4:42
probably aren't watching my videos but
4:44
unless you're at that level you're doing
4:47
it all yourself almost exclusively
4:49
yourself which means you don't have time
4:52
to do it all you could literally run
4:54
yourself into the ground doing every
4:56
little thing on and authors to-do list
4:58
or everything other people tell you you
4:59
should do and you'd never get it done
5:01
and you'd never have time for writing
5:03
which let's face it if you really start
5:05
to prioritize what's most important in
5:08
your career as a writer you can believe
5:10
that actually writing happens to be one
5:14
of the most important things a little
5:15
secret from me to you you need to get
5:18
your writing done which means you have
5:19
to have that creative space instead of
5:22
you know making your creativity somehow
5:25
fit inside the cracks of all these other
5:27
things that you have to do and you you
5:30
know you can't just be like well I'm
5:32
gonna prioritize all of the business
5:34
things and I'm never going to write
5:35
because that you would have nothing to
5:37
sell so you really do have to balance
Prioritize
5:40
your creative writing time with the time
5:43
that you spend on your business and one
5:46
of the most valuable things that you can
5:47
learn to do whether you're at the
5:49
beginning of your career or whether
5:50
you're in the middle or you've been
5:51
doing this for you know 20 years and
5:53
you're just trying indie publishing
5:54
wherever you are in your career then one
5:58
of the most important things you can do
5:59
for yourself is visualize where you want
6:02
to be long term and then begin to
6:04
prioritize all those little things on
6:07
your to-do list until you know okay
6:09
these are the things that are most
6:11
important because they're going to move
6:12
me toward that ideal vision for my life
6:15
now I talk about this a lot when I talk
6:17
about my 90-day planning you may have
6:19
seen I have a video on how I use a
6:22
Kanban board to plan for 90 days so
6:25
every 90 days I set three main goals for
6:28
myself and sometimes those goals stay
6:31
the same each 90 days but it's the
6:34
projects and tasks underneath those
6:36
goals that change so I have my
6:39
high-level goals I have the
6:40
three things that I know I'm working
6:42
toward at all times then I sit down and
6:44
I look at everything that I'm supposed
6:46
to do all the things on my giant to-do
6:49
list that can make me feel so
6:51
overwhelmed if I think I need to do it
6:53
all and I start to prioritize okay for
6:56
where I am right now for this 90 days
6:59
what are the most important projects
7:01
that I need to tackle that are going to
7:03
make the most impact in my career and in
7:06
my life every 90 days those projects are
7:08
different it may be a different book
7:10
project it may be getting more videos
7:12
out or concentrating on working on my
7:14
new course or whatever it is but every
7:17
90 days those projects are different and
7:19
then what I do is once I've decided
7:21
which projects are gonna help move me
7:23
toward those goals then I break those
7:26
projects down into tiny little tasks
7:28
like bite-sized things things that I
7:30
could get done in a single day or single
7:32
afternoon and all of those tasks go up
7:35
on this board here that you see with all
7:37
of these post-it notes in the back and
7:39
this is basically a traditional Kanban
7:41
board except usually I think they go
7:43
from like left to right and I put mine
7:45
top to bottom because that's the space
7:46
that I had in this room but I put all of
7:49
my tasks at the beginning of every 90
7:51
days on that top row and then as I'm
7:54
working on that task I move it to that
7:56
middle section and then once that task
7:58
is done I move it to the bottom and
8:00
you'll see there are four different
8:01
colors there because the yellow is for
8:03
my personal life so that's like books I
8:05
want to read I have it broken down into
8:06
chapters and different things like that
8:08
and that's just personal stuff it's okay
8:10
if I don't clear that stuff out but I'm
8:12
hoping that by the end of December most
8:15
of that board in terms of the blue the
8:18
pink and the teal will be moved down to
8:20
the bottom of that row which means I've
8:21
accomplished all of the projects and
8:24
tasks that I set aside to hit my goals
8:27
so for example just to touch on this
8:30
lightly one of my goals might be to
8:32
publish and promote books in order to
8:36
raise my income to $25,000 a month so if
8:40
that is my goal it has a number attached
8:42
to it I know how I can you know it would
8:44
be very clear at the end of December if
8:46
I have hit that or not because I will
8:48
either be making twenty five thousand
8:50
dollars a month or I won't and in
8:52
order to choose which projects go under
8:55
that I will just say okay if I'm talking
8:57
about publishing and promoting my books
8:59
which projects in the scope of that idea
9:02
or that goal are going to help me to hit
9:05
this particular income goal of twenty
9:08
five thousand dollars per month so then
9:10
I will set you know the project so a
9:12
project might be to write and promote
9:15
book ten of my shadow demon saga which
9:17
just came out last week so that's why
9:19
you see a lot of those teal ones are
9:21
already on the bottom so all of those
9:23
teal tasks are things like plot the book
9:27
right five thousand words right ten
9:29
thousand words you know get to fifteen
9:31
thousand words
9:31
edit the book send it to beta readers
9:33
all the launch stuff that happens like
9:36
send out my arcs to the arc team the
9:38
Facebook live to promote it to my fans
9:40
create teasers you know all that stuff
9:42
is on the board so that I know what I'm
9:44
working toward at any time that is what
9:46
I know I'm focusing on for this ninety
9:48
days but that is nowhere near all the
9:51
things that I feel like I need to be
Focus
9:54
doing or I should be doing for example
9:56
there are lots of things related to my
9:59
newsletter list or to you know wanting
10:02
to get my main series into audio and
10:05
just a ton of other things like that
10:07
that are things I would like to do and
10:09
would probably benefit me but what I
10:12
have learned over the course of the last
10:14
eight years is that if I focus on all
10:16
the things that need to get done what
10:19
tends to happen is I get a little bit
10:21
done on this project a little bit done
10:23
here a little bit done here and whatever
10:24
is pulling it my attention at any given
10:27
moment is what gets all of my attention
10:29
so I end up at the end of you know a
10:31
year even with all of these like half
10:34
started projects and nothing that's been
10:36
consistent or that I've finished or you
10:39
know so I'll have like one one email and
10:42
a newsletter sequence done or maybe
10:43
three or four but I never published it
10:45
because I didn't finish it
10:46
I'll have started some teasers by
10:48
downloading some stock images and
10:50
choosing the quotes that I want to use
10:52
but then I never had time to actually
10:54
create them and post them and now that
10:56
launch is gone and it's a waste of time
10:58
or if it was related to this YouTube
11:00
video maybe I would script out a bunch
11:02
of things and plan my editorial calendar
11:04
but I
11:05
ever got around to actually recording
11:06
the videos and what I saw happening was
11:09
I I was living my entire life like this
11:12
I was constantly running around
11:13
constantly working my tail off and I was
11:16
just never finishing my projects I was
11:19
getting a little bit into this and then
11:20
I would panic this wasn't done so I'd
11:22
move on to task C then move on to task D
11:25
move on to e and I just had this
11:27
mountain of unfinished projects and I
11:30
wasn't moving forward in my career and
11:32
not to mention you know I told you I was
11:34
gonna be talking more about the mindset
11:36
and mental challenges of being a
11:38
self-published author and this is one of
11:39
them when you feel like your to-do list
11:42
is just a mountain of things and you
11:45
know you're not actually making progress
11:46
on them and you don't have a plan for
11:48
how you're going to actually complete
Overwhelm
11:49
things that are gonna move you forward
11:51
it is very very easy to get extremely
11:55
overwhelmed and to just start to feel
11:58
like the world is against you and you're
12:00
not moving anywhere and it can be easy
12:01
to get down on yourself and that kind of
12:05
stuff can steal your joy the same way
12:07
that I was talking about in tip number
12:08
one that comparison can steal your joy
12:11
Oh being overwhelmed constantly can
12:14
steal your joy and I'm sure that many of
12:17
you know this from other areas of your
12:18
life not just your writing but once you
12:22
get into actually doing this as a career
12:24
and professionally being your own
12:27
publisher there will just be so many
12:30
things that you feel you need to do and
12:31
the key to surviving it to really
12:35
thriving and doing the best that you can
12:37
do and continuing to move forward is to
12:40
really sit down and think about what it
12:43
is that you want from your career as an
12:45
individual person not what other people
12:47
tell you to want or what society says
12:49
you should want but what do you want
12:51
what does your ideal life look like and
12:53
if you want to dive into that a little
12:54
bit more I have a couple of resources
12:56
for you that I will link down below one
12:59
is I have a free download on my website
13:02
that is a bunch of questions that leads
13:04
you on this journey of what do you
13:05
really want out of your self-publishing
13:07
career so that's a great resource for
13:09
you all you have to do is head over to
13:11
my website I will link that down below
13:12
and another resource is I have a 90 day
13:16
planner that
13:17
helps you go through this entire process
13:19
of setting up your you know figuring out
13:21
what your vision is choosing your goals
13:24
your projects your tasks and all that
13:26
leads you through this whole thing and
13:27
then it has a planner of you know weekly
13:31
a monthly weekly and a daily planner to
13:34
help you plan out the next 90 days and
Resources
13:36
that is on etsy and I will share that
13:38
link for you down below of course that
13:40
is for right now the one that's up there
13:43
is for q4 which is you know started in
13:46
October and we're now into November so I
13:49
will have an undated version as well as
13:52
one you know the 2019 planner is going
13:55
up on etsy sometime before December so
13:57
just be on the lookout for that if you
13:59
don't want to start like mid 90 days and
14:02
then I also have a course that I teach
14:04
that it's a three-day boot camp that is
14:07
all about like really intensively going
14:09
through this so you can go with the free
14:11
portion the the 15 dollar planner or the
14:14
hundred something dollar course whatever
14:17
helps you I am a hundred percent here to
14:19
help you but I just wanted you to know
14:21
about those resources because these have
14:23
been developed for you know from me
14:26
because it's something that I needed in
14:28
my own career to get myself on track and
14:31
to be as productive as possible because
14:33
you guys have heard from me before that
14:35
I started this year with five different
14:37
series going so if you're new to my
14:39
channel you may not know this but at the
14:41
beginning of this year I had a little
14:43
over 20 books published in my career but
14:45
I had five series going at once and I
14:47
was super overwhelmed and I was really
14:50
in a big bind because I had all those
14:52
series going I just made a decision that
14:54
I was going to get through those five
14:56
series and enjoy the process really put
14:58
my whole heart into those books so I
15:00
could finish the series in ways that
15:02
would make me proud
15:03
but wouldn't burn me out like crazy I
15:06
really had a passion for starting heart
15:08
breathings which I knew I wanted to do
15:09
on YouTube as a resource for other
15:12
authors who like me wanted to write
15:14
books that they love but also make money
15:17
doing it and find joy in this business
15:19
and so I knew it was going to be a
15:21
really tough year in terms of things to
15:23
do so out of necessity this is a program
15:26
that I developed for myself and as I
15:28
started with the YouTube channel I
15:29
started realizing
15:31
people said they were in need of this
15:33
kind of stuff too so that's why I've
15:34
made some of these resources available
My Experience
15:36
for you as well so I have with the help
15:39
of the system been more productive than
15:42
I've ever been in my entire life in this
15:45
last year and I really hope that I can
15:47
keep it going because I've really
15:49
figured out a good way to keep myself
15:51
balanced and to know exactly what I need
15:54
to be working on and just sort of let
15:56
the rest of it go because otherwise I
15:58
sit here and I would think oh my gosh
16:01
there's just so much to do I'm always
16:03
behind and it made me panic it made me
16:07
feel bad about myself
16:08
it made me doubt my own self-worth my
16:10
own ability to continue on with this
16:12
career and I just didn't want to live
16:14
that way I am a writer because I love to
16:17
write and I wanted to get back to the
16:18
joy of creating and the joy of
16:20
connecting with my fans and the joy of
16:23
putting you know myself out there in
16:25
this way and the best way that I found
16:28
to get back to that place of really
16:31
enjoying myself and loving my career and
16:33
my life was to understand there's just
16:37
no way to do it all so I need to
16:39
prioritize what I'm doing and what gets
16:41
my focus based on where I want to go in
16:44
the long term and if something seems
16:47
like it's a good to-do list item like
16:50
putting my books into audio if that
16:53
doesn't seem like it's gonna move me
16:54
forward toward my long-term vision for
16:56
my life more so than something else then
16:59
it just doesn't go on the list right now
17:00
and I know that I will eventually get to
17:03
a point where I address the audiobooks
17:04
but it has not been time for that so
17:06
instead of panicking about not having
17:08
time for you know getting my books into
17:10
audio I just have found peace with okay
17:13
these are my tasks this is what I'm
17:15
working on and I know I'm moving forward
17:17
and making progress but I don't have to
17:19
panic about the things that are not
17:21
getting done because I am NOT doing them
17:24
on purpose so that I can actually
17:26
complete and finish projects and so what
17:28
has happened over the course of the last
17:30
year and a half of following this
17:32
program is I'm actually getting things
17:35
done you know I started a YouTube
17:37
channel I finished my first course I've
17:39
written five books I've you know I've
17:41
gotten a lot more actually done
17:43
completed projects
17:45
rather than all these little pieces that
17:46
are just barely started without actually
17:49
like finishing them and getting them you
17:51
know what people would call shipping
17:53
them so that is one of my top tips is
You Cant Do It All
17:56
that you really just can't do it all so
17:58
don't expect yourself to do every little
18:00
thing that all these other authors are
18:02
doing and you know because I have been
18:04
so diligent this year I have actually
18:06
been able to hire an assistant who is
18:09
helping me get through some of these
18:11
items so that's going to help and as
18:13
time goes on and my income increases and
18:16
my you know how specific I am about what
18:19
needs to get done increases hopefully
18:21
I'll be able to increase her hours as
18:23
well and so that will help and it's just
18:25
really a process just understand that
18:27
you you really are not going to be able
18:30
to do it all and as a side note you're
18:34
not gonna be able to write it all either
18:35
ideas for us as creatives are going to
18:38
come out of the blue you could be in the
18:40
middle of a 12 book series and you get
18:42
these new ideas well guess what if you
18:45
do like I did and you just start writing
18:47
everything that comes into your head
18:49
you're going to end up putting yourself
18:51
in a very very dangerous situation
18:52
because you'll be writing five series
18:55
all at once and that's just not a great
18:57
way to build your fan base and it's not
19:00
a great way to run your career because
19:02
five unless you can write a book a month
19:04
and even then you're only getting two a
19:06
new book in every series every five to
19:08
six months it's just really not the best
19:11
way to do it and I have learned over
19:12
time that one of the strongest things
19:15
that you can do as an indie is to have a
19:17
long you know at least five book series
19:19
where you've got consistent releases
19:22
coming out in that series back-to-back
19:24
so if you have five series going at once
19:26
you're just not going to be able to have
19:28
that consistency unless you can write
19:31
really really fast I at max can write a
19:35
book every two to three months and
19:36
that's like really really pushing myself
19:38
so I have pushed myself quite a bit this
My Ideal
19:42
year but I would like to be able to slow
19:44
down and my ideal would be to write two
19:47
to three books a year which means I
19:49
really need to be focused on one series
19:51
at a time so understanding that not only
19:54
can you not do everything on your to-do
19:56
list but you're not going to be
19:58
to write every single book that pops
19:59
into your head and as interesting as it
20:01
may sound and as heartbreaking as it may
20:04
be you're just probably not going to
20:06
have the time because even if you say oh
20:08
I'm really excited about this idea I'm
20:10
going to put it off for three years
20:11
until this series is done between now
20:13
and three years from now you're probably
20:14
gonna have 20 more ideas that you
20:16
absolutely love so again you have to
20:18
really prioritize like what moves you
20:20
towards your ideal vision of your life
20:21
what story really turns you on what
20:24
story is one that you just have to tell
20:26
which story matches the branding of the
20:29
career that you've built or is going to
20:30
appeal to the fans that you already have
20:32
there's a lot of questions there and if
20:34
you guys would like to see a video on
20:35
how to choose what to write based on
20:38
your priorities I would love to talk
20:40
more about that but it's just
20:42
understanding as you know it's tip
20:43
number five is understanding that you
20:45
can't do it all you can't write every
20:47
single idea you're going to have to step
20:49
back and look at all the things you have
20:51
to do and begin to prioritize and only
20:54
choose the biggest items that are going
20:56
to move you forward the most in your
20:58
career and hopefully that tip resonates
21:01
with you even though it can be a hard
21:02
one to hear again if you are interested
21:05
in some of those resources they will be
21:06
linked down for you down below in the
21:09

writing multiple POV novels is one of my
0:03
passions in life I absolutely love it
0:06
and I have multiple books that have lots
0:10
of different povs including this series
0:12
The Eternal Sorrows series which has
0:15
seven main points of view and sometimes
0:17
an eighth POV I love it it is so much
0:20
fun to be able to show your story from
0:23
multiple perspectives but I know that
0:26
writing in multiple POV can often feel a
0:28
little bit overwhelming and a little bit
0:30
daunting so today I'm going to give you
0:32
nine great tips for how to write
0:35
multiple POV and then I'm going to
0:37
actually show you how I am currently
0:39
organizing my novel The Disappearance of
0:42
Vanessa Shaw which has eight points of
0:44
view so let's get started
0:50
before we go over the tips on how to
0:53
write multiple POV it's important to
0:55
understand what multiple POV actually is
0:58
so POV stands for point of view and when
1:02
we're talking about a character's point
1:04
of view we're not just talking about
1:06
they appear in dialogue or we see them
1:08
through the main character's eyes what
1:10
we're talking about when we say POV is
1:12
that we are actually telling a piece of
1:15
the story from that person's perspective
1:17
as if the reader is inside that person's
1:19
head or is following that person very
1:22
closely so when you have a point of view
1:24
it means we're hearing their thoughts
1:26
we're seeing everything they're doing
1:27
and we're seeing the world through this
1:29
person's eyes so this can be anywhere
1:32
from two points of view in a story to
1:35
dozens if some fantasy novels will
1:38
sometimes have an omniscient point of
1:40
view or an omniscient narrator or they
1:43
will do a third person limited with
1:45
multiple characters sometimes as many as
1:47
a dozen or more and I know that that can
1:50
feel a little bit overwhelming how do
1:52
you even structure a story when it comes
1:54
to this so let's get into these tips
Know Why
1:57
first is to know why you're doing it
2:00
obviously any story is going to have
2:03
multiple characters in it but why do we
2:07
need to see what's inside this person's
2:09
head and this person's perspective why
2:11
do we need to get this person's voice
2:13
this person's knowledge why does this
2:16
particular character deserve to have
2:19
their own part of the story told there's
2:22
lots of reasons behind this it could be
2:24
that this particular character has
2:26
secrets that other people don't know it
2:28
could be that this character or multiple
2:30
characters are split up throughout the
2:32
story and you can't tell the full story
2:33
just from one person's point of view
2:35
there are lots of different reasons that
2:37
we might see this it might be to add
2:39
tension to the story to add Dimension to
2:41
the story to add different perspectives
2:43
or diversity to your story but make sure
2:46
that you have a reason other than just
2:48
you know we've got this one main
2:49
character and then you've got a bunch of
2:51
Side characters that just add flavor to
2:53
the story it really needs to go deeper
2:54
than that where each character has an
2:57
arc they have a reason they have a
2:59
personality and something distinct about
3:01
them that is adding to the story just to
3:03
give it an example of this really
3:05
quickly in my series The Shadow Demon
3:07
Saga I started out with a single point
3:09
of view Harper is the main character and
3:12
the only point of view character in the
3:14
first six books which means that
3:16
everything we see in this story is stuff
3:18
that Harper knows and has experienced so
3:22
we can't see or know anything that she
3:24
hasn't experienced because that's the
3:26
limit that we see when we are going
3:28
through a limited point of view
3:31
when I got to the sixth book and there
3:34
was a bigger battle and the world had
3:35
expanded I realized that I was holding
3:38
myself back as this world became more of
3:40
a fantasy world this is really a portal
3:42
fantasy in essence and I realized it was
3:46
limiting myself and my way of telling
3:48
that story so I decided once we get to
3:51
book Seven to do something a little bit
3:53
unorthodox but that's the beauty of
3:55
being an indie author I can make those
3:57
kinds of creative decisions I split it
4:00
out into four different points of view
4:02
so in book six through right now 11
4:06
gonna be working on the final book 12
4:08
soon you do get more points of view and
4:11
it is four main points of view and even
4:13
sometimes I do split out to A fifth or
4:15
sixth point of view in some of the
4:17
stories and that allows my world to be
4:19
so much richer because I can have
4:21
Jackson in one location that Harper's
4:23
not there and we as readers can still
4:25
see what's happening because when we're
4:27
limited to Harper's Point of View we
4:29
can't possibly know what Jackson's doing
4:31
on the the other side of the world or in
4:33
a shadow World unless they were
4:35
communicating in some way so this way it
4:37
allows me to add more depth to the world
4:39
and more plot and beefier steaks and all
4:42
kinds of stuff so I am a big fan of
4:44
multiple POV you just need to think
4:46
about what am I trying to achieve by
4:48
showing this story from multiple
4:50
perspectives tip number two is that it
One Per Chapter
4:53
is usually best to write each chapter
4:56
from a single point of view you will see
4:59
sometimes that you'll have maybe a page
5:02
break or something and then or a scene
5:04
break and then you'll switch POV Stephen
5:06
King sometimes does this so you will see
5:09
this done well but for the most part it
5:11
is easier on readers when we say this
5:14
chapter is this person's point of view
5:15
which allows us to Anchor that chapter
5:18
into that person's head or that person's
5:20
thought or experiences without head
5:22
hopping one of the biggest mistakes that
5:25
you will see authors making when it
5:27
comes to multiple POV is that they'll be
5:30
really anchored into to a certain
5:32
character's perspective and will hear
5:34
their thoughts and will be in a close or
5:36
limited point of view with them and all
5:39
of a sudden we'll also hear Jackson's
5:41
thoughts and then Jackson will start to
5:43
take over the scene and this is called
5:44
Head hopping where you really are
5:47
getting almost Whiplash from whose point
5:49
of view are we actually in because if
5:51
we're in let's say Harper's Point of
5:53
View she can't hear what Jackson's
5:55
thinking and so when the narrator tells
5:58
us what Jackson's thinking it's a bit of
6:01
a cheat or it's a bit of a head hop and
6:03
there is omniscient point of view and
6:05
we're going to get into tense in just a
6:06
minute but when you are writing in some
6:09
kind of close or limited point of view
6:11
then you need to make sure that you're
6:12
anchoring each chapter or at least each
6:15
section of a chapter each scene in one
6:18
single person's point of view so that
6:20
you're not confusing your reader or
6:21
you're not giving them Whiplash because
6:23
they're hearing this person's thoughts
6:25
but then this person readers like to
6:27
know whose head they're in whose eyes
6:29
they're seeing the story through
6:31
so make sure that you try to keep at
6:33
least at the very least each scene to
6:35
one person's point of view or what I
6:37
prefer to do is to write each chapter
6:39
from one single point of view tip number
Stay Consistent
6:42
three does address this idea of tense
6:45
and what perspective you're telling the
6:48
story from and I could make an entire
6:50
series on this so if I'm going a little
6:52
bit fast feel free to ask questions down
6:54
in the comments but when we are writing
6:57
multiple POV a lot of times what readers
7:00
like to see is a limited point of view
7:03
now you will see a lot of books such as
7:06
the Harry Potter series or multiple
7:08
fantasy series where you have an
7:10
omniscient narrator meaning that the
7:13
omniscient narrator knows everything
7:15
they can see each individual character's
7:17
thoughts they can see the story from
7:19
anyone's perspective they can come out
7:21
and see this Eagle eye view of what's
7:23
Happening across the entire world or
7:24
universe that is an omniscient narrator
7:27
then you will also see a third person
7:30
limited point of view or perspective
7:32
where the narrative narrator can only
7:34
see what this one character is thinking
7:37
this is the type of writing that I like
7:39
to do where I don't usually write
7:41
omniscient I usually write from a
7:44
limited POV so for example my eternal
7:47
sorrow Series has multiple points of
7:49
view each chapter is in a different
7:52
person's point of view and is actually
7:54
labeled with the character's name so
7:56
we'll get into that in another tip and
7:58
then it's in third person so it's third
8:01
person past tense but it's a limited
8:04
tense meaning when we are in a chapter
8:06
that features crash all we can see and
8:08
hear is what crash sees and hears when
8:12
you have an omniscient narrator they can
8:14
see what all the characters are thinking
8:16
but it's not always the best case
8:18
scenario to keep your story high level
8:21
like that where you've got an omniscient
8:23
narrator that can hear everyone's
8:25
thoughts because like I said in the
8:26
previous tip readers like to be anchored
8:30
in someone's eyes or someone's point of
8:31
view so when you get really good at
8:33
writing this scare to be honest this
8:35
type of writing scares me a little bit
8:37
but it is pretty common in fantasy
8:39
writing you will see a beginning of a
8:42
chapter start out a little bit more
8:44
omniscient and then we'll kind of zero
8:46
into a more limited point of view if you
8:49
want to see more videos and examples of
8:51
this I'll be happy to make more videos
8:53
but I think one of the most important
8:55
things you can do is to decide which
8:58
perspective you're telling your story
9:00
from is it going to be first person past
9:03
tense with a limited POV like my Shadow
9:05
Demon Saga where each chapter is
9:07
different character's perspective and
9:09
it's told in the first person like I saw
9:12
this I said this or is it going to be
9:15
third person limited perspective where
9:17
you say she said this Harper walked
9:20
across the room and we're a little bit
9:22
separated from the character's head and
9:24
we're in third person or are you gonna
9:26
mix it up a little bit so sometimes in
9:29
some books especially you'll see this in
9:31
like murder mysteries or detective
9:33
Mysteries you may have the detective in
9:36
first person past tense with a very
9:38
limited perspective where we're just
9:40
seeing things through the detective's
9:41
eyes but then the villain or the killer
9:45
might be in third person or the killer
9:48
might be in second person even that is
9:51
really unusual but it's interesting to
9:54
see that so some chapters are in
9:56
different types of perspectives and that
9:59
can be a good choice to make but just be
10:03
aware again of why you're doing it and
10:05
what is the effect that you're trying to
10:07
achieve let every single Choice here be
10:10
intentional and have a reason behind it
10:12
whether you're trying to affect the tone
10:14
trying to affect the storytelling give
10:17
it some thought and try to decide which
10:19
perspective you're going to be in and
10:21
which tense you're going to be in and
10:23
then make sure that you're consistent
10:24
with that throughout the entire book so
10:27
for example simple you wouldn't want to
10:29
have your village chapters in third
10:31
person and then all of a sudden do a
10:33
villain chapter in first person you
10:34
would want to stay consistent with those
10:36
choices throughout the entire book which
Whose Head?
10:38
leads us to the fourth tip which is to
10:40
be very clear whose head we're in at the
10:43
beginning of the chapter when a reader
10:46
turns the page to a brand new chapter
10:48
they will still be in the mindset and in
10:51
the eyes of the person they were just in
10:54
so if chapter two is in Harper's Point
10:55
of View their mind is going to be
10:57
calibrated to Harper's personality and
10:59
her thoughts and what she's been going
11:01
through what situation we're leaving her
11:03
in so when they turn the page to chapter
11:05
three they're already going to be
11:07
predisposed to think in Harper's Point
11:10
of View so if you're switching we need
11:12
to be really clear about who we're
11:14
switching to and what situation they're
11:16
currently in where are they what's the
11:18
timeline here and anchor that in right
11:21
away so what I like to do there is the
11:23
second you turn the page you've got not
11:26
only the title of the chapter but you
11:28
have the name of the protagonist here so
11:30
you turn the chapter you see that it's
11:32
Jackson and this is pretty common to
11:34
name the chapter or to head the chapter
11:37
with the character's name you don't
11:39
always have to do that I mentioned
11:41
Stephen King earlier if you've ever read
11:42
some of his Ensemble casts like my
11:44
favorite the stand or Under the Dome or
11:47
it you'll notice that even though he's
11:49
changing point of view quite often he
11:52
does anchor us into that character
11:54
pretty quickly so he's usually writing
11:56
third person close or limited point of
11:58
view and he'll just name the character
12:00
he'll say something like you know
12:02
Jackson hunt walked across the lonely
12:05
highway so that we know not only what
12:08
we're seeing in our head
12:10
but also who we're seeing or who is
12:13
talking here and this is super important
12:15
to get your reader to actually like your
12:18
multiple POV story it's crucial that the
12:22
reader turns the page and with every
12:24
single switch you anchor them into who
12:27
is speaking and what is going on with
12:29
that character visually so that they can
12:32
immediately begin to see it so many
12:34
characters experience our books like
12:36
movies running through their head and so
12:38
if we don't tell them where they are and
12:40
give them a visual of who it is and what
12:43
situation they're in right now it can
12:45
really confuse the reader tip number
12:47
five is to make each voice unique which
Each Character Distinct
12:51
doesn't have to actually be over the top
12:53
but to give each character really
12:56
distinct characteristics distinct things
12:59
that they always say or that they're
13:01
thinking about distinct ways of speaking
13:04
so that we always can tell even if you
13:07
didn't give us a name who we're seeing
13:09
the story through right right now so
13:11
giving your character some kind of Quirk
13:14
giving them a specific voice so you
13:16
might have particularly in a romance
13:18
let's say you might have grumpy Sunshine
13:21
Trope so every time we're in that guy's
13:24
point of view and he's grumpy we're
13:25
gonna get a harsher rougher way of
13:28
thinking a more negative way or that
13:31
type of perspective whereas if we're in
13:33
the female Sunshine happy point of view
13:36
she's always going to be looking on the
13:37
positive side of things and the way she
13:39
speaks in her own mind will naturally
13:42
sound very different and so giving your
13:44
characters a particular and distinct
13:46
voice can be also very important in
13:49
making sure that we're anchoring the
13:50
reader in the feel and tone and style of
13:53
that character tip number six is to
One Main Character
13:57
consider focusing on one main character
14:01
so a lot of times when we have an
14:03
ensemble cast you will see that each
14:06
individual character has their own
14:08
personality and they're very distinct
14:10
but usually there's one main character
14:13
and it's often the character we meet
14:15
first that the main part of the story is
14:17
intro you know introduced so if you
14:19
think about The Walking Dead it's Rick
14:21
like Rick is the main character of that
14:23
series and even though we often are in
14:26
Michonne's point of view or we're in
14:28
Daryl's point of view and we get to see
14:29
their stories and their backstories Rick
14:31
is the main character he's the main dude
14:33
right and we see so many of the turning
14:36
points of the story the beginnings and
14:38
the ends of series or Seasons fall on
14:40
this one character who is the main hero
14:43
of the story and a lot of times this is
14:45
another way to Anchor readers into the
14:47
actual plot of the story The Wheel of
14:50
Time for example is one of my favorite
14:51
series of all time there are dozens of
14:55
point of view characters throughout that
14:56
entire series but we all know that Rand
14:59
is the main character and that is the
15:01
person that we see not necessarily first
15:03
in the story but he's the first one that
15:05
we really get his deep close perspective
15:08
and that's often how we anchor readers
15:10
into our story in my eternal sorrow
15:12
series it's perish in my demon series
15:15
it's Harper and everybody kind of is
15:17
able to know that when Harper is on
15:19
screen it's really her story they're
15:21
most emotionally connected with and even
15:24
though you may have other characters
15:25
that you begin to love you do sort of
15:27
see that story in the stand it's Stu
15:30
Redmond we see him as one of the first
15:33
people to encounter the virus in the
15:35
stand and we follow him throughout and
15:37
it's his story we're most anchored into
15:38
but Franny is my favorite character so
15:41
you give people those different
15:43
perspectives but you anchor the plot
15:45
line with one main character this is not
15:47
always true for romances though for
15:49
those of you that are romance authors
15:52
you know that really both main
15:53
characters if you're telling dual POV
15:55
there with romances have their own full
15:57
story arc and their fully fleshed out
16:00
characters so that's one way that
16:01
romance can differ in multiple POV from
16:04
an ensemble cast but the seventh tip is
Don't Need To Alternate
16:07
to not feel like you have to all
16:10
alternate every single chapter so if you
16:13
had four points of view you don't have
16:15
to feel like each chapter goes one two
16:17
three four one two three four in a round
16:19
robin style and this is one of the
16:21
biggest mistakes I will see people make
16:23
right from the start is that they feel
16:25
they have to keep it balanced there's 10
16:27
chapters in each person's point of view
16:29
or five chapters in each and we have to
16:31
go alternating and you don't even have
16:33
to do this in Romance where you have
16:35
maybe two points of view it doesn't have
16:37
to be you know female male female male
16:39
or you know whatever type of romance
16:41
you're writing male male whatever but it
16:44
doesn't have to alternate that way
16:46
sometimes it makes more sense for us to
16:48
see this particular character number one
16:51
going through three different
16:53
experiences before we move on to
16:55
character number two so don't feel like
16:58
hindered by this idea that you have to
17:01
alternate or you have to keep them
17:03
balanced remember that I was just
17:04
talking about there often is that one
17:06
main character
17:07
and sometimes we will see that main
17:10
character in more scenes than we will
17:12
anyone else in the will of time for
17:14
example in that very first book The Eye
17:16
Of The World Rand is by far the
17:18
character we're in his head the most
17:20
that isn't always true of later books
17:23
and in fact there is a later book in the
17:24
series where I don't think we even get
17:26
rand's point of view at all even though
17:28
he's really the main hero of the story
17:30
we see him the most in that first book
17:33
because the author is really trying to
17:35
Anchor the story in rand's point of view
17:38
Rand story he's setting him up as the
17:40
hero and we won't go into a game of A
17:44
Song of Ice and Fire Game of Thrones
17:46
because he definitely broke some rules
17:48
there with Ned but that's a conversation
17:50
for another day the main thing is just
17:52
understanding that each scene needs to
17:55
have a purpose it needs to follow that
17:57
idea of a character's goal their
17:59
conflict what's holding them back from
18:01
achieving their goal and their outcome
18:02
if you are not familiar with this
18:04
breakdown of scenes from goal uh con
18:07
conflict outcome I have a great video
18:09
for you that I will link down below or I
18:11
will put up here in the cards for you to
18:13
check out about writing scenes in this
18:16
way in fact I have an entire series here
18:18
on YouTube with a free workbook that you
18:21
can download all about creating scenes
18:23
just make sure in your multiple POV
18:26
novels that each scene has a purpose and
18:29
there you're telling it from the
18:31
perspective of the character who has the
18:33
most at stake who has the most
18:35
interesting part of the story who has
18:37
the most emotional reaction to what's
18:38
going on it is pivotal that we don't try
18:42
to just have filler chapters where it's
18:44
like well Jackson was next in the
18:46
rotation so I had to have a chapter with
18:48
him even though nothing much is
18:49
happening every single scene needs to
18:51
have a purpose even if it means you
18:53
don't see Jackson for six chapters tip
Character Arc
18:55
number eight is that each character will
18:58
often have their own fully fleshed out
19:00
character Arc they're on fully fleshed
19:03
out backstory and they see themselves as
19:06
the hero of their own store story right
19:08
so even in the will of time Rand might
19:12
be the main character to us as readers
19:13
but Perrin believes he is the main
19:15
character of his own story because it is
19:17
his own life and so each character if
19:20
you really want to tell it well and make
19:21
it compelling needs to have their own
19:24
personality their own full character Arc
19:26
and they need to go through what we know
19:28
as the hero or the heroine's journey now
19:31
that doesn't necessarily mean that we as
19:34
readers will see every detail of each
19:37
character's Arc because we would end up
19:40
with books that are 500 000 words plus
19:42
long it's just that we as authors need
19:46
to know what's going on with those
19:48
characters even if all of those scenes
19:49
don't make it on screen or on the page
19:52
so to speak also what I have found with
19:54
writing a longer series 12 I'm on Book
19:57
12 now with multiple characters as POV
20:00
characters is that oftentimes a
20:03
character like Aaron for example he gets
20:05
a full character Arc but it doesn't
20:07
always span a single book sometimes it
20:10
spans three books before we see his
20:12
fleshed out character Arc and so I would
20:15
love to do a series talking a little bit
20:17
more about this because I feel like it's
20:19
something I've learned through doing and
20:21
reading a lot but it's not something
20:22
that there's many books or articles
20:24
written about so if you want to see more
20:27
in detail about how to actually
20:28
structure a series with multiple points
20:31
of view please let me know in the
Weave Them Together
20:32
comments tip number nine is really more
20:34
of an observation that one of the most
20:36
difficult parts of writing an ensemble
20:38
cast or multiple povs is weaving them
20:41
together in a way that really resonates
20:43
with your style with your genre and with
20:47
your readers themselves so I write young
20:49
adult portal fantasy young adult
20:51
contemporary fantasy and I love twists
20:54
and turns and in fact my readers have
20:56
lovingly named my Cliffhangers Sarah
20:58
hangers because I leave them basically
21:01
on a Dun Dun Dun kind of moment at the
21:03
end of every single chapter and that's
21:04
one of the reasons that I love playing
21:07
with multiple OV so much is because I
21:09
can have Harper going through this
21:11
situation of she has a goal there's a
21:13
conflict and then the outcome is a
21:16
cliffhanger that will lead her into her
21:18
next goal and conflict but I leave her
21:21
hanging and I move on to another
21:22
character's POV who might be in a
21:24
completely different place and my
21:27
favorite authors are brilliant at being
21:29
able to take us to a climax moment for a
21:32
character leave them hanging and leave
21:34
me like dying to turn pages really fast
21:37
to see what happens to that character
21:38
next but then also anchoring me
21:41
immediately in another character's point
21:43
of view and getting me interested in
21:44
them where I'm all over the map I like
21:47
love this character and can't wait to
21:48
see what happens next but I love this
21:50
character too and you so you want to
21:52
make sure
21:53
that you're weaving these points of view
21:55
together in a way that leaves your
21:57
reader feeling exactly the way you want
22:00
them to feel and that is going to be
22:01
very genre dependent so the white way
22:04
you might want to leave someone in a
22:05
women's fiction multiple POV book at the
22:08
end of every chapter might be very
22:09
different than the way you want someone
22:11
to feel at the end of your murder
22:13
mystery chapters or your horror chapters
22:16
so really think about genre when it
22:18
comes to this and I know I've just
22:19
barely touched on some of these items
22:21
but hopefully this has been helpful for
22:23
you and if you want to see a lot more on
22:26

22:28

22:32
comment down below and let me know if
22:33
you're writing multiple POV if you're
22:35
interested in writing multiple POV and
22:37
any questions that you might have just
22:40
briefly I'm going to talk a little bit
22:42
about how I am doing this in my own
22:44
current work in progress which is a
22:47
standalone why a thriller called The
22:49
Disappearance of Vanessa Shaw so let's
22:51
take a look okay step into my writing
My Plot Wall
22:55
room with me where I have my entire plot
22:57
figured out on my wall so if you want to
23:01
see how I did this I will link my video
23:02
down below but I basically just took
23:04
easel paper and rolled it out and taped
23:06
it onto my wall and I use sticky notes
23:09
to visually be able to plot my story and
23:11
for me this is super important and super
23:13
helpful especially the color coding and
23:16
the visual of how the scenes flow
23:18
together when it comes to multiple
23:19
points of view because it's just more
23:21
complex type of story to organize so I
23:24
would love to go more in depth in this
23:26
if you guys want to see more in the
23:27
future but for today I'm just going to
23:29
give you a high level overview so you
23:31
can see I have act one act two part one
23:34
act two part two so that means this part
23:36
is the midpoint of the book and then we
23:39
have the conclusion act three Climax and
23:42
resolution on the bottom and and I have
23:45
divided each Act with a little piece of
23:50
washi tape here because the way that I
23:52
have decided to handle multiple POV in
23:55
this particular story is that we have
23:57
not only multiple points of view but we
24:00
have multiple timelines so one timeline
24:03
is present tense so that is the top of
24:07
this line here and you can see that
24:09
every Post-It note on that line is
24:11
purple because in the present day we
24:15
have just one point of view so Lorelei
24:17
who is my main character that the whole
24:19
story is anchored in she is the only
24:22
point of view that we see in the present
24:24
day timeline
24:26
in the past though we also have a
24:28
timeline of the summer leading up to the
24:31
day that Vanessa disappeared and in that
24:34
past timeline which is the bottom
24:36
section here of my Act of each Act of
24:39
the board we have multiple points of
24:42
view which is why you start to see all
24:44
these different colors here and the way
24:46
that I've decided to structure this
24:49
story is that we have Lorelei in the
24:51
present and she is introduced right from
24:54
the start as the sleuth of our story
24:56
she's the one who's trying to figure out
24:59
and can't let go like what actually
25:01
happened to Vanessa and it's still up in
25:03
the air and she believes that the people
25:05
who were there that night Vanessa
25:07
disappeared no more about what really
25:09
happened than what they've ever told
25:11
anyone and so now what's happening is
25:14
it's a year since Vanessa disappeared
25:16
and everyone who was there that night is
25:18
getting together again to honor her
25:20
memory as they're all graduating from
25:22
high school and so Lorelei knows that
25:24
this is her chance to really investigate
25:27
and find out what happened and there's
25:29
really high stakes here for her which
25:31
I'll go into when I talk about this
25:33
story a little bit more but basically
25:35
this is like I need to figure this out
25:37
to be able to move on with my life and
25:40
so she's looking for Clues and she's
25:42
looking for answers to the questions
25:44
about what really happened and so the
25:46
way I'm anchoring these past timeline
25:48
povs is that all of these same people
25:51
are there with her in the present but
25:53
we're only seeing the present tense from
25:55
her perspective but every time something
25:58
happens that triggers a memory of what
26:01
happened that night we go into the past
26:04
and we get to see these different
26:06
characters and what really happened and
26:09
so this in this way I'm weaving these
26:12
together by by something in the present
26:13
triggers a past memory but it's not
26:16
lorealized memory it's a memory of the
26:18
other people that are there that night
26:20
and slowly each person there has some
26:23
kind of secret that gets revealed until
26:26
finally we find out who it is that maybe
26:29
was responsible for Vanessa's
26:31
disappearance so it's a murder mystery
26:33
it's got a little bit of Supernatural
26:36
elements a little bit of elements of
26:37
unreliable narrator and this has been a
26:40
really fun book to figure out but
26:42
hopefully you can see from the tips that
26:44
I kind of came up with a framework here
26:47
of present day is one single POV
26:50
the past tense is all everyone else's
26:53
point of view we do get Lorelei in the
26:55
past as well and so we know when we're
26:58
in someone besides Lorelei that we're
27:00
anchored somewhere in the summer before
27:02
Vanessa disappeared this is very unlike
27:05
any other story that I've done but it
27:07
does hopefully show you a little bit of
27:09
how flexible and interesting multiple
27:12
POV can be thank you so much for being

27:51
thank you

hi everyone and welcome back to Heart
0:01
breathing's today I'm going to talk
0:03
about my February heart breathing's
0:06
notebook challenge and show you what
0:07
notebook I'm using how I did in January
0:09
and there will be a notebook giveaway
0:11
today as well so stay tuned so if you're
0:18
not familiar with my notebook challenge
0:20
for this year I will link the video that
0:23
I did at the end of last year where I
0:25
talked about how many notebooks I've
0:26
kind of been hoarding over the years and
0:28
I know that many of you are like me
0:29
because you made a lot of comments and
0:31
have been tagging me on Instagram and
0:33
everything so I know that a lot of you
0:35
are like me that you cannot resist
0:37
buying a cute or beautiful notebooks but
0:40
sometimes it can be hard to sort of make
0:42
ourselves fill them in I know for me it
0:44
can just feel like oh my gosh I've got
0:46
this beautiful notebook and it doesn't
0:48
seem important enough to just write my
0:49
thoughts in there so I'm not going to
0:51
use it I'm going to use this other
0:52
notebook or whatever and so I you know
0:55
even though I will have a bunch of cute
0:57
notebooks that aren't being used because
0:58
they feel too like precious I will still
1:01
go to Barnes & Noble and be tempted to
1:03
buy new notebooks so I am trying my best
1:06
not to buy new notebooks this year and
1:09
instead I'm going to be using up or
1:12
challenging myself to use up at least
1:13
one full notebook every single month of
1:15
the year and I'm going to be giving one
1:17
away to you guys so that way I will get
1:19
rid of or use up at least 24 notebooks
1:22
this year and hopefully not add to my
1:24
collection and I've been challenging you
1:26
to do the same so if you have a notebook
1:28
collection or if you want to go out and
1:30
buy a notebook if you haven't had one I
1:31
also will link my ideas on 30 plus ways
1:35
to use your notebooks so there's lists
1:37
there's journaling there's tons of tons
1:39
of ways that you can use your notebooks
1:41
so if you feel inspired by any of that
1:42
then you can grab a notebook either from
1:44
your stash you could win one for me or
1:46
you could go out and buy a pretty
1:48
notebook to use this for yourself and if
1:50
you do decide to join this challenge
1:52
then please use the hashtag HP notebook
1:54
challenge and tag me on Instagram or
1:57
Facebook so I can see what notebook
1:58
you're using this month that being said
2:00
not everybody is going to be able to
2:02
fill a notebook every single month
2:04
because some of the notebooks that we
2:06
have are really big and it takes a lot
2:07
of time so if you have a 200-page
2:09
notebook you got to fill almost ten
2:11
pages you know five to ten pages
2:13
every single day and that can really
2:15
take time so not everybody has that kind
2:17
of time so don't feel that you have to
2:19
fill a complete notebook you could just
2:21
join the challenge and say I'm gonna
2:22
fill up as many notebooks this year as I
2:23
can or I'm just gonna make an effort to
2:26
use up all the pretty notebooks that
2:27
I've been hoarding so with that being
Notebooks
2:29
said this was my notebook sorry for the
2:32
lighting the glare a little bit this was
2:34
my notebook for January and I decided to
2:37
start big because I tend to get more
2:40
done at the beginning of the year when
2:41
I'm like starting a new challenge and
2:42
stuff like that so this is a huge like
2:44
200 page notebook that is full pages and
2:47
you guys I did not do a great job there
2:52
were days where I spilled it out like
2:54
several pages a day and then were other
2:56
days where I just did not have the time
2:58
or feel well enough to do it so I would
3:00
say if you look at this I only got this
3:04
much of it filled in so maybe a quarter
3:07
of the notebook got filled in and that
3:09
is it so obviously I did not finish
3:12
because I have all of these pages yet to
3:14
go and it is just it turned out to be so
3:16
much writing that it takes to fill up
3:18
this notebook I'm not going to abandon
3:20
it because I am determined to fill up
3:22
this notebook and to fill up twelve this
3:23
year so what I'm going to do is I'm
3:25
going to continue have just been using
3:26
this for journaling and you can see I've
3:28
got like I don't know how well you can
3:31
really see it but I've got just like
3:33
different journaling and thoughts and
3:35
stuff that have gone into this so I'm
3:37
going to continue to use this for
3:38
journaling until it's filled up and I've
3:40
also chosen another notebook for the
3:43
month of February and even though it's
3:44
February 3rd today is at the 3rd
3:47
it's February 3rd today I am going to
3:50
start this notebook today and so this is
3:52
going to have a different purpose rather
3:54
than journaling this is an Erin Condren
3:56
hardcover notebook you can see it's much
3:58
smaller in terms of both height and in
4:02
terms of how many pages are in it this
4:05
is a dot grid notebook they had a sale a
4:07
while back where they were I think it
4:09
was maybe Black Friday or some point at
4:12
the end of the year when I bought one of
4:13
my planners they had a deal where it was
4:15
only five dollars for their hardcover
4:17
notebooks so I picked this one up
4:19
because it's this pretty blueish teal
4:20
color and you can see here hopefully
4:23
that'll start to show up if I can get
4:25
the lighting right that it has just
4:27
grid pages and at the top of the page it
4:29
has a different colorful flag at the top
4:31
so this is not going to take as much
4:34
time to fill up and I already have a
4:35
specific purpose that I'm going to use
4:37
because these pages are obviously much
4:39
narrower and it's just not going to take
4:41
me as much time so I'm hoping that I can
4:42
actually continue to work on this barse
4:44
notebook and I can fill up this one as
4:47
well in the month of February so my
4:49
purpose for this notebook is I'm going
4:51
to start taking notes on all the
4:53
different modules and the recordings
4:55
that I'm doing for my upcoming
4:56
self-publishing course if you're
4:58
interested in that course I will leave a
4:59
link down below this is a course for
5:02
authors who are looking to self publish
5:03
and the first course that's going to
5:05
come out is a more basics course it's
5:06
going to teach you like everything about
5:09
uploading a little bit about advertising
5:11
how to get your mailing list set up
5:13
whether you need a business or like an
5:15
LLC or doing business eyes whether you
5:17
should use pin name how to start your
5:19
account at Amazon whether you should go
5:20
Konoe unlimited or not so it's kind of
5:23
more the basics if you haven't yet
5:24
published or if you've just published
5:26
recently and you only have a few books
5:28
out that course will hopefully be
5:29
launching in April so I was hoping to
5:31
get it out by February but I have been
5:33
keeping a secret from you guys and I
5:35
still can't tell you everything but
5:37
you'll kind of get to know in a few
5:39
weeks when I'm able to make an
5:40
announcement about some things that have
5:42
been going on why I have not been as
5:44
productive in January as I typically am
5:46
and there is a good reason for it so I
5:49
will reveal that in a few weeks but for
5:51
now I have been kind of just taking it
5:53
easy and you know going very slowly so
5:55
things have been going on a slower pace
5:57
and that's fine too sometimes we just
5:59
need to take a little bit more time but
6:01
this will be my like everything
6:04
self-publishing course notebook so I'm
6:05
going to be keeping all the notes on
6:07
like and I do videos for the course I
6:09
have to outline everything what videos
6:11
I've recorded and everything else so I'm
6:13
actually gonna spend some time this
6:14
afternoon setting up all my plans for
6:16
the course all the modules I already
6:17
have them outlined out but I'm gonna go
6:19
ahead and rewrite them in here so that I
6:21
can start making a plan about when I'm
6:22
going to record all of those videos
6:24
because it's going to be you know
6:25
probably a hundred plus hours of work in
6:27
the next couple of months to get that
6:29
course going so I'm excited and I'm
6:31
hoping that by the time February is over
6:34
the course will actually be mostly
6:35
recorded and all of these notebook pages
6:37
will be completed so moving on

7:31
the previous ones have been open

international subscribers back in but I
7:55
have to kind of keep costs down so if we
7:57
you understand that
7:58

8:01
of how I did which was not very great

8:06
had a lot of people join into the HP

January go I know most people are not

Instagram stories where they already
8:17
finished their entire notebook for June
8:19
or January so I am really really excited
8:21

[Music]
hey everyone welcome back to part 6 of how to plot your novel today we have
0:05
made it to the final battle the climax and resolution we are going to be talking about elements of act 3 first of
0:16
all have congratulations to everyone who has made it this far in the plotting series I know that these have been kind
0:22
of long and detailed but I sincerely hope that you have been getting some value out of them and a lot of good tips
0:28
on how to plot your own novel so today we're going to be talking about the elements of the act 3 which basically is
0:34
just the climax of the story and the resolution so that sounds easy but there's actually a lot of elements that
0:40
go into making your act 3 really great so let's get into it and of course if
0:46
you are new to the series or you have not yet downloaded your free plot your novel workbook you can get it from my
0:52
website at heart breathing's calm slash plot your novel I will link that for you down below in the description box but
0:59
that gives you all of the sheets that we've been filling out for this and you can feel free to use them over and over
1:05
again in your own plotting there's also a resource list in the back of the book and I cannot highly recommend these
1:10
books to you enough everything that I'm talking about in this series comes from things I've learned from these books and
1:15
from my own experience plotting novels over the years so please check out those resources as well so just to bring you
1:22
back up to speed on where we are in the story we have just had the end of act 2 which ends with the second doorway so
1:30
your character has now passed through that second doorway and we had a long discussion on that in the last video so
1:35
make sure that you've watched all of these in order but basically your character has now made a decision or
1:41
chosen a path that locks them into the inevitable final battle act 3 needs to
1:47
feel like it's moving like you know you're on a rushing train towards the end usually act 3 is the shortest act of
1:54
your story whereas like I said you know act 1 is that big setup and everything Act 2 is
1:59
so big that it's broken usually into two parts before and after the midpoint well act 3 is usually fastest paced the
2:06
momentum is just going really fast and everything is leading you to that inevitable climax that and ever
2:12
final battle that has to happen and of course what type of battle your character is fighting a hundred percent
2:17
depends on what genre you're writing so in an epic fantasy for example this is
2:23
going to be an epic battle usually in young adult paranormal it's also going to be an epic battle think Harry Potter
2:29
I think you know the ending of The Hunger Games and how intense that is you're gonna have some kind of actual
2:34
death stakes here where someone's about to die or you really truly believe they're going to die and there's no way
2:39
out and you've got to ramp up that tension if you're writing a romance at comedy however this is going to be
2:44
something that's really funny but you're also gonna see that character come into their own and sort of claim who they are
2:50
and the truth is going to come out and of course the final battle in most romances is just simply the characters
2:58
overcoming whatever things were holding them back in their internal journey so they can apologize to each other or make
3:04
that final declaration of love and overcome whatever it was that was holding them back in the relationship in
3:09
the first place so it's not going to be an actual epic battle it might be an epic proclamation I love you and you
3:17
know this is where you're gonna pull out all the emotion and you know if it's a comedy then it needs to have some funny aspects to it if you're writing a
3:23
mystery then this is going to be the moment where it all comes together and the shocking twist if who actually
3:30
killed the person is revealed and probably your detective is going to be in some kind of danger and have to fight
3:35
their way out of it in some way so pay close attention to how the genre that
3:40
you're writing wraps up this climax and resolution and make sure that you stay true to the to the genre and norms and
3:47
to what readers are used to in that genre but let's talk about the different elements so one of the first things that
3:52
you're going to start to see in the third act is what james-scott bell calls mounting forces so this is basically
3:58
where we start to feel relentless momentum in the story if your readers need to feel that we know that final
4:05
battle is coming so the antagonist needs to gather their forces and go harder against the heroine like if we go back
4:12
to Hunger Games it's kind of like okay now they're going to force these people since there's only a few people left
4:18
alive they're going to force them into a place where they have to meet each other no more waiting this story out we're
4:23
going to mount forces we're going to increase the tension we're going to ramp but the conflict and we're going to
4:28
force a battle here at the end so you're going to see those mounting forces in a romance or a romantic comedy what we're
4:35
going to start to see is all those problems start to come out you know you think about confessions of a shopaholic
4:40
the truth about her finances starts to come out and all that stuff starts to ramp up so we're going to see the sort
4:48
of like those dominoes are going to fall down so much faster as everything leads towards that final battle so you need to
4:54
feel like the tension is ramping up the stakes are you know getting higher and we're really starting to feel that
5:00
momentum and whether you have an actual enemy like Lord Baltimore or whether you
5:06
have just an enemy of the truth or the fear of your character losing everything whatever it is you need to start
5:12
bringing up those fears and the antagonist needs to start making themselves more and more known whether
5:17
we know actually who the antagonist is or not I feel like often in a mystery or when you have a mystery inside your
5:24
story this is also where the clues start really coming together and they're coming hard and fast and this is where
5:29
you want the reader turning the pages because they're so close to understanding whodunit or what's really
5:35
going on here and so it's moving really really fast so think about fast pace kmy
5:40
Lin and her book structuring your novel also talks about one of the best ways to quicken the pace of your novel and I
5:46
have found this definitely to be true in my own work because I was doing this intuitively before I even read her book
5:51
which is to shorten your chapters shorten your scenes even shorten the dialogue and the things that are
5:57
happening shorter scenes that are really packed with action or with meaning or with reveals and plants and twists and
6:03
things like this start to make your reader go faster and faster and then they get to an end of a chapter and there's that big cymbal crash and
6:10
they're ready to move on to the next one so think about you know if you've had these long sweeping chapters in the
6:15
beginning of the book think about shortening your chapters a little bit and making them really action-packed or really emotionally packed in at this
6:22
point in your story to quicken the pace next what we're gonna see is the final plan and this is something that comes
6:28
from Alexandre Sokoloff screenwriting tricks for author she says that somewhere towards either the very end of
6:34
act 2 or in the beginning here of act 3 your characters are going to formulate what is their final plan
6:40
and after reading a lot of books where I've looked at this sort of story structure and after writing many of my
6:46
own and watching movies I've noticed that the final plan can really be something as simple as a sink single
6:51
statement where your character says okay no more of this other stuff no more fooling around we're going straight here
6:57
and we're going to take them down your characters come up with that final formulated plan and they go for it and
7:03
you know that whatever it is they decide this last time is what they're actually going to do it doesn't usually pan out
7:08
exactly the way they expect it to because you know we are writing a story here that should have lots of twists and
7:13
turns and unexpected moments but this is you know that final plan that sends them
7:18
on the journey that they're that's going to take them to the final battle so hopefully that makes sense now you don't necessarily have to have them state the
7:25
final plan it can just be understood this is you know what they're going to do next but I find that it is often the
7:31
case in movies and in literature that you do have your characters either sit down to convene depending on the type of
7:38
story about what they're going to do or it's just this realization in your character's head that you know what this
7:44
is what I have to do and this is a big part of the story arc I find sometimes where it's like okay well I have no
7:51
choice now but to face this head-on so I'm going to formulate my plan and move forward then what you'll also see often
7:57
is what Alexandre Sokoloff calls storm the castle now if you think I think one
8:03
of the examples she gives in one of her workshops and maybe in her book as well is you think about The Wizard of Oz and
8:08
this is where you know they storm the castle to get to the Wicked Witch so this is a it can be a physical storming
8:15
of the castle actually changing from one location to another as you enter the enemy's lair kind of thing or it can be
8:22
just simply storming the castle in more figurative sense like okay now I'm going
8:27
to go to the moment where it all began or I'm going to face my greatest fear
8:32
and go into where the enemy is which can in a romance be I am going to show up at
8:38
her place of work and I'm gonna tell her how I really feel so just think of the storm the castle moment being like that
8:44
now something else that's Alexandra Sokoloff talks about that I love from her workshops is that she says you know
8:50
often as your characters are moving and set themselves up for that final climax or final battle it's what you would call a
8:57
set piece and she also mentions this in you know it can be often the first doorway happens as a set piece and the
9:03
midpoint and so on that each of these sort of climaxes for the acts are set pieces but the climax for act three
9:10
should be the biggest set piece of all and what she means by set piece is in a movie this is where you've got the big
9:16
castle or all the spaceships are out and they've got the Death Star you know or
9:22
whatever so this is where they've really spent the money and ramped up the special-effects so in some way if you
9:27
can make this guns blazing one of your biggest scenes visually as well as action-packed then it often has that
9:35
kind of impact on your character now something that km Weiland says in
9:40
structuring your novel is that some of the best act threes or climax and resolution moments in fiction come with
9:47
a balance of inevitability and unexpectedness and this always has
9:53
resonated with me because I think that it is so so important to have your
9:58
reader when they hit this final battle and you're moving towards this storm the castle moment or the final battle itself
10:05
that your reader feels like oh my gosh this is exactly where the story had to
10:10
go the whole time that they feel like they weren't cheated that it's not some huge surprise that it comes down to
10:17
these two people in the end however there's got to be some unexpectedness as
10:22
well that oh my gosh even though we knew it was going to come down to this battle I never expected it to be him who was
10:29
the bad guy or even though I knew that the murderer was going to be someone close to the detective I never thought
10:35
it would be her mother that kind of thing so you've got the unexpectedness the twists the way that it actually
10:42
happens the way the battle goes down might be a surprise or it might be unexpected because there's a million
10:47
possibilities and you brought it down to this one but your reader also needs to feel that it fits the story that you've
10:53
had enough foreshadowing and enough clues throughout the story that this is where it was headed the whole time that
10:59
it just fits together and it clicks in just the right way what you don't want is a climax that feels like it cheats
11:05
the reader in some way that like your hero or your heroin had nothing to do with saving the day and they were sitting on the
11:11
sidelines and now we've got just this random coincidence that saves everything that is not going to be a very
11:16
satisfying ending and predictability that you knew oh I could have told you who the killer was the whole time can
11:23
often also kill your story so you want that balance of oh my gosh I knew this
11:28
is where it was going but I never thought it would end exactly like this so you've got that excitement but you
11:33
have that satisfaction at the same time and if you want a really great explanation of what she means by that
11:39
and how to do it in terms of what she says is it's it's a mix of foreshadowing and complications and I love the way
11:46
that she words that in her book definitely pick up structuring your novel by km Weiland because it is brilliant by now in act 3 your
11:53
antagonist or whatever the antagonistic force of your novel is been ramping up and the forces are mounting against your
12:00
hero or heroine they have created their final plan they have stormed the castle and ended up in this thematic location
12:07
that potentially is symbolic of their greatest fears they're facing finally
12:12
that past wound that we talked about when we were talking about creating great characters they're facing that
12:17
wound they're facing death in some way either figurative or literal when we hit this black moment it's kind of all down
12:24
to this okay so now that they've stormed the castle whatever happens something goes wrong in this moment now if you
12:31
remember we talked about this a little bit in act 2 part 2 where sometimes
12:36
people say that second doorway is the black moment but it can also happen here in act 3 I typically like for that
12:44
second doorway to be a moment of extreme loss that inspires your character to
12:50
move through the doorway but the actual black moment happens right here before that final character transformation
12:56
again I think this does sometimes depend on genre often in romance that second
13:02
act climax is going to be the black moment they've broken up you don't think they're ever going to get back together and then the final battle is just the
13:10
apology or the truth comes out and they make their statement and proclamation of love and that is the actual final battle
13:17
but in the stories that most of the stories that I write we have an actual battle happening where someone is potentially going to die so
13:24
you have some kind of loss or some sort of devastating event that happens in the end of act 2 that makes your character
13:30
go to fight that final battle and somewhere when they're going like storming the castle or they're going to
13:36
get to that final villain something goes wrong they get captured they lose their weapon they someone
13:43
betrays them or whatever happens like in The Hunger Games for example they tell them hey if two of you are from the same
13:51
district and you win we're gonna let you both live so it's like okay we can work together we can make this happen but
13:57
then the black moment of course is that they're both standing there and they say oh never mind you have to fight to the
14:03
death and so then it's like how are we going to get through this all is lost
14:09
so the black moment that happens here is the one that is everything has been leading to this moment and your
14:15
character has failed or the forces against them have just become too great and this is the final thing that forces
14:23
your character to change so in the midpoint they saw themselves in the mirror remember we talked about James
14:30
Scott Bell's mirror moment in the midpoint they saw what was wrong what they needed to do to change their lives
14:36
that change or die moment but they couldn't quite do it because in the rest of Act two they've been fighting those
14:41
battles over and over again but they haven't fully embraced their transformation well this black moment
14:47
this moment where everything else is lost and they're gonna die or they're gonna lose everything their greatest
14:52
fears are being realized this is the moment that forces your character to change and this is why it is so
14:59
important to know all those things about your character that we filled out in the writing great characters video because
15:05
if you don't know what it is that your character desperately needs versus their goal what they need on their internal
15:11
journey what their wound is what their greatest fears are if you don't know those things about your character you
15:16
are going to end up with a climax and black moment that comes off flat and not
15:23
as emotional as it should be and if you really want to make an impact with your fiction it needs to be emotional it
15:28
needs to grab your reader and make them feel something here at the part of the reason that the Hunger Games
15:34
was such a wildly popular series is because those readers we all loved
15:39
Katniss so much and when you get to that moment where she finds out she is going
15:45
to have to kill Peeta who she's now developed all these feelings for and risked everything to save you know save
15:52
each other's lives and she is actually thinks that she has won and she has beat the Capitol this black moment forces her
15:59
to change it forces her to say I'm not playing your game anymore I'm gonna beat you at your own game and that's the
16:05
moment that her character changes when she makes that decision and without that character's change in
16:11
the black moment and in that climax without them reaching deep inside themselves and coming up with that
16:18
desire to truly change who they are and overcome whatever's been holding them back you don't have nearly as much
16:24
impact as you could otherwise now I do know that there are some types of stories where your character does not
16:30
have such a huge character arc growth so you've got some stories that are more episodic like detective stories can be
16:37
this way often where you've got a single character that goes through many many books and they don't have as much of a
16:43
dramatic character arc change at the end of every climax it's just something very small but if you can still add in that
16:49
emotional resonance here where they do have to realize something that they didn't know before even if it's not some
16:55
great overcoming of their wound entirely and you'll see this in a series as well
17:00
like you can't necessarily fix all your character's internal emotional problems in book one because then where will they
17:07
be and what will they still have to overcome by book six but you do need to set up whatever internal wound they're
17:14
fighting in book one and they need to have some kind of small victory or some kind of realization that they grow and
17:19
push beyond I really hope that I'm explaining that well and that you understand it because this is one of the main things that allows your story to
17:26
have resonance that your whatever that internal need that your character had whatever wound or lie they were telling
17:33
themselves all along I'm not good enough I'll never be a leader I am NOT deserving of this or whatever thing they
17:39
told themselves this is the moment when everything is lost when we feel like there is no way out
17:46
moment what like James Scott bell calls their death and rebirth moment in this black moment where they realize the only
17:53
way they're going to survive or the only way this ends is if they allow that old piece of them to die and they're reborn
18:00
in this new way and it needs to resonate and directly correlate to whatever it is
18:05
they realized in that mirror moment and this is one of the main reasons that when I'm plotting originally I do that
18:12
triangle that James Scott bell talks about I have it in the writing great characters thing so for example like in
18:18
deep dark secrets in the beginning Moriah says no one believes me so I'm going to have to lie and cut everyone
18:25
out of my heart to try to be who they want me to be so she's denying her true self by trying to fit back into this old
18:32
world and not letting anyone know what's really bothering her in the midpoint she makes that mirror moment decision of
18:38
something is really going on here and if I don't change and let someone else in
18:43
and allow him to help me and begin to embrace what truly happened and face it
18:49
head-on I'm going to die and then we'll see when we go through the plot here at the end
18:54
for my novel that in the last moments when she thinks all is lost she has no
19:00
choice now she's well her choice is either I'm going to literally die or I'm
19:05
going to have to give up this piece of myself that is holding back now I'm gonna have to embrace this new me so
19:11
it's a death and rebirth moment and the black moment is so much stronger if your reader is sitting there going there's no
19:18
way out of this I have no idea how they're going to get their way out you as the writer have to be smart enough to know how you're going to get them out
19:24
and that can be the trick is like how do you come up with something that seems so locked that your reader can't see your
19:30
way out but you've already figured out that way out and it is one of the hardest parts but it is so amazing and
19:36
such a great payoff when you can pull it out and a lot of times that will have something to do with what James Scott
19:42
bell calls the Q factor so let's talk about that briefly so this is explained so well in James Scott Bell's book
19:48
superstructure he and I'd never heard anyone else talk about this before but it's one of my favorite favorite beats
19:55
to put into a novel so Q of course he's getting that from the James Bond movies where you've got this
20:01
Q character who always is giving James Bond to these great gadgets like oh you can put this camera in your shoe and
20:07
like this watch becomes like a gun you know whatever so you've got that Q
20:12
character who in Act one when James Bond is getting his next assignment you know you see oh here's
20:17
these gadgets in the car and here's all these things and then a lot of times at the end of the novel when he's you know
20:24
over this tank of sharks it's like oh yeah now I remember this is a grappling hook any you know shoots the grappling
20:31
hook out of his watch or whatever it is I haven't really seen a lot of James Bond movies but you get the point some
20:36
kind of thing that is like a gadget that gets him out James Scott Bell isn't saying you need to put in these gadgets
20:42
what are you saying is use the cube factor as an emotional impetus something that you've set up in the first act of
20:50
your story that comes back to remind your character who they really are what they really care about have some sort of
20:57
emotion regarding it that allows them as sort of like a trigger now this can
21:02
happen before the black moment or it can happen during the black moment or right after the black moment when they're
21:08
actually fighting so this is kind of a moveable piece of the puzzle it can come up show up kind of anywhere in the third
21:13
act and you're gonna have some stories that don't really have it at all but I love adding that Q factor and I'll show
21:19
you how I use to in deep dark secrets but it's great to have that moment like that necklace or those words that come
21:25
back to you that somebody said that that make you realise what it is you can do with this moment or something that gives
21:32
you that emotional impetus that emotional motivation to change so it can
21:37
be a memory it can be a physical object it can be anything that gives your character the courage to fight back then
21:44
of course we have the final battle and like I said what type of battle this is is greatly going to depend on your genre
21:51
so one of the best things that you can do is to study movies and other novels
21:57
in your chosen genre to see how they handle final battles to see what your readers are going to expect but
22:02
basically the final battle is that moment where your character finally faces whatever the antagonistic force of
22:08
the novel is and they either win or lose but everything's been coming down to this and in this final
22:14
battle you are usually going to see your character change and one way or another
22:19
this final battle will end the primary conflict with your antagonist or your antagonistic force in a romance your
22:26
hero may come to your heroine and say I'm so sorry I was an idiot I have changed I'm going to take responsibility
22:33
for this but I can't live without you and I need you that is the final battle and then your heroine will be fighting a
22:38
battle of her own if like can I learn to trust him again or can I open my heart and she'll have her own moment and then
22:44
it will be over one way or another they'll either break up forever or they'll be together and if it's a really good romance they'll be together and if
22:51
they're not together it's not actually a romance this is the moment that ends the battle in one way or another your
22:57
character is going to fight the antagonist and they're either going to win or lose and depending on where you
23:03
are in your series or if you're writing a standalone or what type of ending you want your story to have they'll win or
23:10
lose in some way you need to decide for yourself what type of ending you're going to have you really want to have
23:15
that satisfying ending you need to have a final battle that ends whatever the main story was for this novel whatever
23:22
the main conflict was for this novel it needs to have an ending and it needs to either be they won or they lost and if
23:30
they lost then we'll probably have another book coming after it okay and wildin says that this is most powerful
23:35
when it comes on the heels of some sort of revelation that your character has just made so this is where we go back
23:41
into story arc or character arc is this final battle is the most powerful that
23:48
it can be when your character has that realization like we were talking about they dig deep and they realize this is
23:54
what I have to do to survive and then they follow through with it and they win the day because of their change because
24:02
they finally embraced who they needed to be all along that's when you have the most emotional resonance that you can
24:07
have in a climax so be thinking about how you can set that up another important thing to note is that this
24:13
final battle needs to be the inevitable conclusion of your story so you know
24:19
whatever it climaxes you've had in act 1 in the mid in the doorway of act 3 it all needs to
24:25
be related to who they're fighting here at the end so if they didn't know who the antagonist was the whole time this
24:31
is the moment where they found out who it is and they put an end to that antagonist or they battle them in some way so this doesn't need to be just some
24:39
random battle that you throw into the story this needs to be the logical conclusion of everything that you've
24:45
built along the way and we will talk more about that in video number 7 coming next Thursday where we talk about
24:50
bringing it all together the final beat of the third act is the resolution and you can choose for
24:57
yourself what kind of resolution and how much or how long the resolution needs to be I think that there's a delicate
25:03
balance here and again it can depend on Chandra you want to give your reader a glimpse into the new future for your
25:09
character now that they've changed now that the situation's been resolved or this antagonist has been defeated
25:15
whether it's forever or just for now we want to see a glimpse into how their life has changed and a preview of their
25:21
new life so how much you show of that whether it's just a simple epilogue that shows your characters married now or
25:28
getting married or epilogue or just a scene that shows you know your character
25:34
coming home and their new life how it is it's really up to you just how much you want to show but it is always nice
25:41
instead of just ending right there at that final battle is over to have some sort of resolution some sort of
25:47
discussion between your characters you get that glimpse into what's going to happen next in the story now for me in
25:53
my main series what I love to do is I love to have that final battle wrap up
25:59
what's going on with the antagonist of this particular story or the main conflict of this story then there's a
26:05
brief resolution where we see like the character beginning to relax and like oh it's over they have the resolution with
26:11
their friends or their care you know other characters of love interest or whatever and then have that one final
26:17
scene at the very end that sort of introduces the next conflict and a lot of people will call this cliffhangers
26:23
because I leave it on that like last symbol crash or surprise moment but really what I've managed to do hopefully
26:29
is into the main conflict or the main antagonist of this particular story and
26:35
then I'm introducing what's going to be the main conflict of the second book or the third book or whatever the next book
26:41
is in that last moment which gets readers excited for what's coming next and as a viewer and a reader myself I
26:48
love those moments so it's like not the final battle in the resolution but then you have this little cliffhanger T's at
26:55
the end that teases what's coming next for your characters but that's up to you whether you want to write cliffhangers
27:01
you know and whether you're writing a series or not but one of the main things that Khayyam wildin talks about when she's talking about the resolution is
27:07
what you want to do is you want to engage the reader's imagination for what comes next for your characters and I
27:13
think that if you can do that so that they can kind of see what your characters life looks like happily-ever-after then you've done a
27:19
great job and if it's not the last book and you've got another book coming in the series then you just want that
27:24
resolution to sort of give that emotional resonance to this particular conflict being resolved and then it's up
27:31
to you whether you want to tease the next conflict or not with all that being said hopefully that explains the third
27:37
act well to you and I'm going to show you now how I followed through with these beats in my book deep dark secrets
27:43
okay so now we're going to take a look at act 3 or the conclusion of deep dark
27:48
secrets and I apologize in advance but apparently there were some focus issues when I was recording this and I didn't realize it till after and I couldn't go
27:55
back to record it so you'll you'll get to see it but it's just not great so anyway we have increased danger and
28:01
mounting forces at the beginning of act 3 and in my story this presents itself first as increased stakes because Mariah
28:08
and Jordan begin to have a little bit of romantic development between the two of them which makes Mariah realized that
28:14
she has something to live for and it makes her realize just how hard she has to fight against what she now knows is
28:20
an evil spirit that's trapped inside her body what they decide to do is investigate Hailey's runs using GPS maps
28:28
that she used to post on her Instagram and they do find the cave with the broken Idol that the medicine woman was
28:33
telling them about but here's where the new revelation comes in there are two sets of footprints so they find out here
28:39
one of the big twists and reveals of the story is that another person was out running with Haley that day
28:45
and the spirit that was in that Idol was split in two so their final plan becomes to find out who else was running with
28:52
hailey that day and who has the other half of the spirit because whoever has that spirit in them has apparently lost
28:58
themselves to the darkness to the evil and it's going to kill Mariah now Mariah
29:04
believes that the person that was running with hailey was Lena which is the ex you know remember Mariah's
29:11
ex-boyfriend Troy that's his new girlfriend that she's had this run-ins with before and she decides that they're
29:17
gonna break in Selena's house because she's away for the weekend and they're gonna look for proof of this evil spirit
29:22
which means they're looking for some of those like frantic type of dark drawings
29:27
that she found kind of on Hailey's walls in Hailey's room so she doesn't find
29:32
that and when she doesn't she ends up in an argument with Jordan and they separate and Mariah says fine I'm going
29:38
to leave to meet with Nicole because I've been putting her off and we need to study so angry she goes to Nicole's
29:43
house looking for her friend and this is the biggest like black moment twist reveal of the story is that it turns out
29:50
you know Nicole gives her water or coke I wrote question marks they can't remember what she takes from her she
29:55
gives her a bottle something to drink and as they're studying mariah starts peeling off and she realizes at this
30:00
point that she's been drugged and that's the moment that she realizes Nicole is the one that was out running
30:07
with Haley that day they were all three on the running team together and this was all set up earlier in the book and Nicole was the one running with her and
30:14
she has the other half of the Spirit and that Nicole was the one who drugged them that night at the party and now she's
30:20
drugged Mariah again so at this point Mariah loses consciousness and when she wakes up she's tied up in the woods and
30:27
she's alone out there with Nicole in the middle of nowhere with no phone no way to reach out to anyone so this is the
30:33
all's lost moment and she's facing death at this point now I wrote read journal
30:38
here because if we remember back when Mariah first went to Hailey's bedroom in
30:43
act 2 she found out that Hailey's journal was missing and that journal is part of the big reveal because nicole
30:49
has it all right so the Q factor the way that I dealt with this in this book is the medallion that she got and she found
30:56
that she had at the begin the story that she wasn't sure where it came from and that she found out in the midpoint is Jordan's brother spirit
31:04
Walker medallion that is part of her two-factor she holds on to oh she remembers the medallion she grasps a
31:10
handful of dirt and she calls upon her ancestors and that's just how I used that cue factor as an a moment of
31:15
emotional impetus and resonance and when she does that she fully is forced to
31:21
change here and she embraces her truth she embraces her light and her true
31:26
spirit walk herself for the first time and she is able to have the medallion
31:32
the light burst forth from the medallion and her chains are broken and she's able to defeat the evil spirit in Nicole
31:39
which then subsequently actually kills her friend who you know used to be trapped inside that body and now she
31:45
takes that evil spirit all into herself so it's a kind of a positive ending that she defeats the evil spirit but then a
31:52
hard ending in that she now has to take the full force of that spirit into herself which sets up book two
31:59
resolution is that Jordan finds her there in the woods they hide the body he takes his brother's remains because
32:05
Nicole had killed his brother to bury them on family land and I tie up the rest of hallucinosis funeral and then
32:13
when Jordan returns they seek out the remaining two idols because there were three sisters that the medicine woman
32:18
told them about one is found intact and they take it to the medicine woman and her tribe but the second is smash and
32:24
there's a single footprint in dus so this resolve is that the first part of the story and sets it up for book two
32:31
okay guys that is it for video number six which carries this all the way through act three of your story and by
32:38
now if you filled out all of these things you should have the main structure of your entire story from
32:44
beginning to end done so what we're gonna talk about in the next video which is how do you bring it all together how do we figure out not
32:51
just what are these beats but how do we bring that into scenes and how do we
32:56
make sure that it feels like a cohesive whole so we're gonna be talking about that in the next video and then the
33:02
final video of this series number eight is going to be what do you do when you get stuck just so just two videos left

next video bye [Music]
hey everybody welcome back to Heart breathings it is editing time I have
0:05
already started editing my latest novel The Disappearance of Vanessa Shaw however I have not made as like big
0:13
strides great progress as I had hoped and I have had some struggle focusing so
0:19
we're going to talk today about the writer reset what my plans are for June and how I am going to finish the edits
0:26
of this novel and hopefully get it published this summer so let's get started [Music]
Beginning My Edits
0:36
so I don't know how many of you have potentially been going through something similar but for the last couple of
0:42
months I have had the most difficult time trying to focus and I don't fully
0:47
know what has made this different but getting into a state of flow and deep
0:53
work has been more difficult for me and I have also realized that I have let
0:58
some of my boundaries around my internet and phone usage get a little bit too
1:04
wonky some of my lines here so I am sort of doubling down for myself because I've
1:10
started to realize that while I can be distractible and still check emails get
1:15
my Facebook group stuff done even edit videos in a state of somewhat distracted
1:20
by my phone or other things that are going on it is extremely difficult for me to do
1:26
the Creative deep work that is needed to finish a novel and edit sometimes are
1:32
even more difficult in terms of the amount of deep focus and deep work they
1:37
require because there's so many decisions like now we're getting into the nitty-gritty details like the rough
1:42
draft has less stakes in some ways because it's like well I can always fix that later but now is later now is the
1:49
time where I'm meant to be fixing the book and sitting down to try to focus on the
1:56
decisions that need to be made have been extremely difficult for me so I'm adding
2:02
to my writer reset a concentration on deep work and what I can do to get myself into deep focus so this is going
2:12
to be particularly challenging because like many of you my summer is slightly
2:18
hijacked by having kids at home and I know not everybody here has kids but I will be doing a video coming up soon
2:25
about how to continue to work towards your goals during the summer even if your schedule has shifted because some
2:31
of you have more time over the summer some of you who are parents might have a lot less time over the summer or even if
2:38
you're unrelated to school or other things like that you might have different times in your year where your
2:44
schedule shifts due to different responsibilities or caretaking or even to your own health so I will have a
2:50
video coming up on that but for me I am trying to get myself to a place of
2:56
deep focus throughout the summer while also enjoying the heck out of time with
3:01
my kids my little girl who is three will be starting pre-k this fall right before
3:07
she turns four and it's going to be a life-changing kind of thing to have gone
3:13
from four years with a little one at home every day all day to having a little bit more of that time freedom but
3:20
I also want to enjoy as much time with her as possible and of course my son who will be finishing up fifth grade and
3:26
turning 11 this summer is also going to be home with us so I have created a schedule again I'll share that with you
3:32
guys later but my motto for this summer is work hard play hard I'm hoping to get
3:39
into deep focus so I can make the most of the time that I spend working but
3:44
also just really enjoy my time with them and have a good time this summer as well
3:49
so what we're going to talk about in today's video is really this is going to be an editing blog but I'm also going to
3:54
talk a little bit about that focus and I'm going to walk you through the steps that I'm taking to get myself into a
4:00
focused state to finish this book I would love to finish it in the month of June I'm not going to put any pressure
4:07
on myself by putting up a pre-order or anything like that however you guys can be my accountability let's finish this
4:13
book in the month of June let's do it I know I'm capable of it so let's talk about how I'm gonna accomplish that
My Editing Plan
4:21
okay so like I said one thing that has been coming up over and over again is a
4:27
lack of boundaries around my phone and internet usage my ability to focus has
4:33
been severely cut by my distractibility and I know that even though I have all
4:42
of my dings and notifications on my phones turned off that when
4:49
if this doesn't happen to me as much when I'm editing a video or checking emails or doing other things but when my
4:55
brain hits a point in the story or the work that feels difficult I also hit a
5:00
Wall of Resistance where my brain is like I don't want to have to make that decision right now why don't you just
5:05
check your phone and see if anyone's responded to that Instagram and it feels like because I'm posting on Instagram or
5:12
I'm answering people's comments or answering people's emails it feels like work it feels like I'm being productive
5:18
but I'm also sacrificing the things I want to accomplish most like making the
5:25
decisions getting the edits done for just sort of like temporary easy to
5:31
accomplish tasks that really could be done other times so I'm gonna be setting some boundaries by setting some app
5:38
limits on my phone I'm also going to be doing more focused Sprints I have shown
5:43
you guys this before I have this timeular device that I like to use for tracking my time I don't use it all the
5:49
time but I do use it sometimes but this device does not beep at me when my timer
5:55
is up it's like if I turn it to writing it will just go for hours and hours if
6:00
I'm writing and it has not been the most efficient way to track my time because if I want to use pomodoros which is
6:08
basically writing Sprints where I'm saying I'm going to work for 15 or 20 minutes or 25 minutes which is my
6:14
preferred time I'm going to write for 25 minutes without distraction and then I'm going to take a five minute break and
6:19
then write again for 25 minutes so we have a writing Community here on
6:24
Facebook and on YouTube called the heartbreathings writing community that the foundation of it is this type of writing Sprint which by the way we do
6:31
have our June double down day coming up this Saturday so I'll link that calendar down below We'll Be Live almost all day
6:38
Saturday in two hour increments doing 25 minute Focus Sprints as a group so if
6:44
you want to come join us I'll link that for you down below but I have found that when I'm trying to
6:49
do those sprints on my own I am using my phone to track the time
6:55
like setting my phone as a 25 minute timer and what happens is that even
7:00
though I have my dings and sounds turned off I can still see that I have a
7:07
message on Instagram where I can still see on the home screen that I have an email or a call or a Marco Polo or
7:13
something like that so if I'm casually glancing down to see how much time is left on my Sprint timer I am also then
7:21
often getting pulled into oh well let me go answer this quick Instagram and before I know it 20 minutes have gone by
7:27
and this is not the way I want to run my life it's not my intention to be on social media when I mean to be writing
7:34
and so I'm nipping it in the bud so to speak I am putting an end to it now and one of the things that I'm doing besides
7:40
the app timers and I'm going to be actually turning off notifications not just the sounds but the actual like
7:46
messages on my phone I also purchased this little Cube from Amazon I can't
7:51
remember how much it was as bills like maybe 10 or 15 dollars and they have them in different time increments the
7:57
good thing about this is that I don't have to use my phone at all now it doesn't keep a record of anything but it
8:03
does track my time just like a kitchen timer so this one has a five minute timer 25 minutes 15 minutes and 45
8:12
minutes and I like these time increments but you can get them in different colors and different increments but I like this
8:18
because I like to do 25 minute Sprints with a five minute break and then my longer breaks are typically 15 minutes
8:24
so I probably won't use the 45 minute one as much you can hear it beeping because I keep moving it but if I wanted
8:30
to set it for a 25 minute Sprint for example I would just turn it to 25 minute sorry if I wanted to set it for
8:38
25 minutes I would just turn it to where the 25 minutes is up and you hear it beep and then on the bottom it has a
8:44
timer that's running so I can just briefly look at it without being distracted by my phone to see how much time is left then it will beep at me
8:51
when 25 minutes are up and then I can turn it back to straight and then turn
8:56
it on to five minutes so that now I have a five minute timer running and that
9:02
will help me I hope string together more focused Sprints without having to ever
9:07
pick up my phone for a timer or go to a different web page for my timer so that's one big thing that I'm doing to
9:14
increase my focus another thing that works for me time and time again whether it's productivity or
9:20
tasks or writing is breaking things down into smaller chunks and I don't know why
9:27
I forget to apply this to my writing because I use this in my hb90 method all
9:32
the time which by the way if you're watching this when this video first comes out hb90 opens for enrollment this
9:37
weekend so definitely come back and look for that link I will link it for you down below but the registration will
9:44
open until Sunday at noon but that is opening up again so if you want to learn how to get more done come join us for
9:51
that but with my writing sometimes I forget to break things down into small
9:56
achievable tasks I do it all day long with my big projects like marketing and
10:02
videos and other things like that but the same can apply to our writing and
10:07
sometimes when I sit down and I start to think about my edits I'm just thinking about the entire novel and all the work
10:14
that has to be done and that starts to get super overwhelming so to improve my
10:19
focus and my joy and my ability to get things done I'm gonna be breaking it down into smaller segments of tasks so
10:27
first instead of thinking about the entire novel I'm just gonna start my edits with act one so let me tell you
10:34
about what I've done so far in the editing process since it's been a few weeks since my last writer reset video
10:40
and then you're gonna follow me through the next steps
What I've Done So Far
10:45
so the first thing I did was a post draft brain dump this was literally just
10:51
sitting down I think I sat down for about an hour and a half to two hours and I just wrote out all my thoughts
10:56
about the rough draft and the story so far what I think needs fixing what I feel like was really good where I think
11:02
things are going and where I need to focus and this ended up being about 5 000 words of just basically stream of
11:08
Consciousness and it was really helpful to me to understand sort of where my weak points are and what I feel like was
11:14
going well about the book another thing that I did was I went to went out to a
11:20
coffee shop I had one of my larger note cards which is maybe like a five by seven note card and I wrote out what the
11:28
major plot points of the novel so on this part I was focused on the entire book start to finish but I was only
11:34
focusing on those major turning points so for me this is the opening scene and the hook the first doorway of no return
11:41
and then the midpoint the climax and the resolute solution so I just wanted to
11:46
make sure that I had those nailed down in the present timeline because I've got dual timelines in this book and I wanted
11:53
to make sure I was really clear on that and exactly what's happening and what that does is it gives me a road map to
11:58
follow like I know at the beginning of the novel where I'm heading and that is one of the advantages to finishing your
12:04
rough draft is often you start to know at least what the path you're following is even if you don't have all the dots
12:10
yet connected so I did all of that work I got those big note cards done and that
12:17
felt pretty good I also started reading some books that have split timelines or dual timelines so for example the book
12:24
that I'm reading right now is called the broken Girls by Simone St James it is excellent she is such a great writer and
12:30
I've heard amazing things about this book in the past and it is not disappointing me now what she does in
12:36
this book for the majority of the beginning of it as dual timeline is it's literally just alternating you have one
12:42
in the present day one in the past one in the present day one in the past and each one in the past is from a different
12:48
girl's point of view and that really works for this particular story I'm going to potentially experiment with
12:54
that in my own because that's one of the biggest questions that came up in my post draft brain dump is how am I going
13:02
to weave these two timelines together in a way that makes it most effective so
13:07
I'm gonna experiment with this of just simply alternating it and seeing how that feels but sometimes it can be super
13:14
helpful when you get to the editing phase the drafting phase at any phase to pick up books in your genre or this
13:21
isn't even a why a book that I've been reading I've read multiple split timeline books at this point and none of them have been young adults they're not
13:27
exactly in my Niche or genre but they are Mysteries so they're adjacent and
13:33
they're giving me ideas even though the stories are very different from my story it's giving me ideas as to the author's
13:39
process and what works in storytelling and what doesn't so sometimes reading can be effective in your edits next I
13:46
did something that I had started working on before I even finished my rough draft which is created an outline of all of
13:53
the scenes and chapters that are currently in my rough draft now mine are not in order like they normally would be
14:00
with the chronological book that follows you from point A to point B without ever like splitting off to different
14:06
timelines so I have large chunks of the present day timeline and then I have
14:11
like a huge section like 40 000 words that's all past timeline and none of it
14:17
is in order of how it's going to be when I start alternating things so it's a bit
14:22
of a mess but I went through and I made that outline so I knew exactly what scenes I had already written and made a
14:29
list of scenes that I know I want to write that were not yet written yet so this helps me to identify the holes of
Act One
14:37
what I have and what I still need to write okay
14:42
so that brings me to today so what I'm going to be working on today is I'm
14:48
going to take my graph paper so this is just a huge pad of graph paper I think
14:54
it's like 11 by 17 but I will link this for you I got it on Amazon I know you can also get this kind of graph paper at
15:01
Office Depot I'm pretty sure probably Staples and other places like that but it is just graph paper it has blue lines
15:09
to it it's really nice and what I'm going to do is I'm going to section this off into act one act two part one act
15:15
two part two and act three so four sections of the book and I'm going to start working on the timeline and above
15:22
the line I will write out anything that's happening in the present tense timeline below the line I will start to
15:28
write anything that is alternating scene by scene in the past timeline I'm also
15:34
going to take a brand new set of note cards and I'm going to begin to write out everything I know about each of
15:40
those scenes in terms of what's the overview of the scene what's my character's goal in that scene what is
15:47
the conflict and what's standing in their way and what what's the resolution how does it end up that's going to be
15:54
mostly for the present day scenes for the scenes in the past I'm going to get into the nitty-gritty of how does this
16:00
tie into the present timeline and what like who knew about this I'm gonna make
16:06
sure that I mark on my cards which of the characters at the cabin the night Vanessa disappeared knew about this
16:12
event and who was it a secret for because that's going to play into the mystery as well so I really want to get
16:18
clear on those details so basically at this point when I say that I'm going to be breaking this down into smaller tasks
16:24
what I'm going to focus on starting today is only act one so I'm going to set up this grid I'm going to take my
16:30
note cards but I'm only going to focus on act one and I'm going to take those notes that I have about the beginning of
16:35
Act One the hook the inciting incident and where Act One ends up the first doorway of no return which is the a key
16:43
event the thing that locks our character into the main story which in this case is we have characters who know at the
16:50
beginning of the story that Vanessa disappeared a year ago that's the inciting incident is that Vanessa disappeared and no one ever saw her
16:56
again they're coming back to this cabin one year later to celebrate graduation and to kind of Honor Vanessa's memory
17:03
and really the main character Lorelei is looking for some kind of closure as to
17:10
what really happened to Vanessa because she has carried for the past year a lot of guilt and doubt about being the last
17:17
person that saw Vanessa alive that night and so it becomes a mystery with our
17:23
sort of amateur Y.A sleuth trying to decide um or trying to figure out really what
17:29
happened so that she can find closure and move on with her life and so by the time we get to the doorway of no return
17:35
we have an event happening at the cabin where they lose power and they're
17:40
basically stuck on this island sort of by the river where they can't get off
17:45
until tomorrow so they're going to have to survive the night and they don't know whether what's happening to them is
17:52
Paranormal is it Vanessa's ghost come back to haunt them or is whatever person
17:58
potentially killed Vanessa coming back to finish the job and so there's danger
18:03
there's mystery there's a lot of conflict a lot of suspense a lot of drama and I just want to focus on that
18:10
piece of the path what is you know this part of the puzzle here this top and so
18:17
part of what I'm going to do is I'm about to just go out to a coffee shop for a couple of hours I'm going to take my blank graph paper and I'm just going
18:24
to work on those questions what are the scenes that are happening in act one only starting with the very first scene
18:29
I'm not going to be editing or rewriting anything I already have yet I'm just going to be working on the order of scenes and the trajectory of what
18:37
happens in each of those scenes then when I come home I'm going to transfer all of that onto this now you can see
18:42
this part of my plot wall is already pretty well finished however a lot of
18:49
this stuff is going to change because in the edits I'm realizing you know things need to move around a little bit so I'm
18:55
going to figure all that out I'm gonna come back I'm gonna put it on the wall and then what I'm going to tackle tomorrow in tomorrow's session is I'm
19:02
going to actually create a new document that is brand new Clean Slate nothing on
19:08
it yet and I'm just going to copy it chapter by chapter so I'll start with the prologue I will fix and rewrite the
19:14
prologue based on the things I decide today and then once prologue chapter is done I will go back to my original rough
19:21
draft I will copy chapter one or whatever I feel like is the right chapter to grab and I will begin
19:27
rebuilding a second draft from that first draft when I hit any scenes that
19:32
have not yet been written I will write them and that's the way I'm planning to work through my edits is scene by scene
19:37
chapter by chapter and not worry about where it's going to end up at the end just yet I'm just gonna break it down to
19:44
one tiny step at a time and I'm gonna do it in 25 minute chunks or pomodoros and
19:50
I'm hoping that by the end of June this entire thing will be done but I'm going
19:55
to just take it one day one step at a time and not overwhelm myself so let's grab this graph paper and let's head to
Coffee Shop Trip
20:01
the coffee shop [Music] Show Me Love this is
20:09
[Music]
20:19
[Music]
20:27
[Music] this is
20:32
[Music]
20:41
sometimes life will push you down make you fall on through the ground
20:49
but I know you will turn it around oh this is all we got
20:57
interference [Music]
21:10
oh this is
21:21
we can wait for better days but the days won't come hello again so it is the next
Another Day of Edits
21:28
day and I'm continuing on with edits I got Evie in here in my office she's doing a little bit of coloring with me
21:33
so here's how far I got I kind of have things spread around on the floor but
21:40
let me turn this video around so yesterday at the coffee shop I had already done some of this plot work and
21:47
I started working on my timeline so as I had mentioned I'm only working on act
21:53
one but I took this grid paper and I just did counted four blocks and then
21:59
four blocks below so above and below the timeline and then I put a bonus block
22:04
here and then four blocks four blocks another four blocks and so on so I've got act one two part one two part two
22:10
and act three and then a little bit of space here at the bottom of course Gotta Throw Some washi tape on there
22:16
but I am basically figuring out how I'm alternating and so far you can see it's
22:22
all in purple so this is all lorelei's point of view but I'm about to add in my
22:29
first non Lorelei POV here in the past so I'm going to start using some other
22:34
color and then I'm going to start weaving those in so that's basically all I got done
22:39
except that I also worked on my note cards so on my note cards I did put a
22:46
goal and I like to especially once I've finished my rough draft to have a basic
22:52
idea of about how many words I'm working with in each act so if you have a novel
22:58
that is let's say 90 000 words and you divide that by four you're going to end up with about 22 500
23:05
words for each Act I'm not exactly sure how this will look once it's all edited
23:11
so I'm giving myself between about fifteen thousand and twenty two thousand words for this act and just knowing from
23:18
experience how much how many scenes that is for me and how much room that is to
23:24
get to the point so I know where I'm starting which is part of why I filled out some of these plot points I know the
23:31
hook and the opening scene and I know where I'm going so that gives me the trajectory in the road map then to
23:38
understand how many words I have on average to get there now this is not obviously something everyone needs to do
23:44
you might just follow your intuition and it works out great but I do like to make sure that my act 1 climax happens
23:52
between 20 and 25 into the book so I just like to keep an eye on my word
23:57
count but then I stay flexible if it ends up being a little bit long or a little short but I'm just trying to keep my eye on the pacing once I get to the
24:04
editing I'm starting to focus more on those kind of details now in these
24:10
actual note cards I've mentioned this before that I start
24:15
with an overview of the scene the goal of the scene in terms of the character's goal the conflict that's keeping them
24:22
from their goal and then what's the outcome did they achieve their goal did something come up did the conflict
24:28
create a new like goal for the character and so on and part of the reason I don't
24:33
always do this in my rough draft but part of the reason I do this in my edits is
24:39
multiple reasons for me one being that I can make sure that whatever the outcome
24:44
of this scene is naturally leads us into the next scene because often something
24:50
will shift or change in this scene from what the character expected which then sends them on to the next scene and what
24:56
the conflict is there like a new conflict they're dealing with new information they want to get new relationship stuff so it it helps me
25:04
figure out the flow of the plot another thing is the goal because this is not
25:10
about my goal as a writer sometimes I will write that for example like this on
25:16
the back I'll say my goal as a writer is to introduce such and such to the reader
25:21
but the character will have a goal in the scene and part of the reason that I like to focus in on this in my editing
25:27
note cards is because this informs my character Arc what is this
25:35
character's goal in talking to this person what is this character's goal in showing up at this cabin after a year
25:40
what is she hoping to accomplish in this scene and for this character this first scene for Lorelei in the present day
25:46
timeline is to really decide like does she want to go through with this does she want to stay and she's sitting there
25:52
behind the bridge kind of like the bridge is a gateway into no turning back
25:58
for her in a way and she knows that this is her chance to really decide do I go
26:03
and see these people I haven't seen for a year and start to really find closure with Vanessa's disappearance or do I
26:10
just turn around and go home so that's her goal and me knowing what her goal is in completing this action and walking
26:17
through the scene helps me to know what type of interior monologue this character is going to have what is her
26:23
motivation in talking to people how is she going to approach conversations how she going to approach information what
26:29
is she going to be feeling what do I want the reader to be feeling and it just makes everything more clear then
26:36
when I know what the conflict is and the outcome it makes me it gives me so much
26:41
clarity about when I go back to these scenes to edit them I can really
26:47
uh tighten up the character Arc the motivation the feelings the emotions and
26:52
what the reader is seeing I can't always focus on that when I'm writing the rough draft because I'm just trying to get the
26:57
story on the page so this type of process where you know I've got kind of a messy story on the page but now I'm
27:04
beginning to structure it a little bit more tightly this is where the magic is
27:10
for me and this is why I love edits is because it starts to make everything clear and every time I clarify
27:17
a little bit more of what's going on inside the character's interior mind and their feelings and how they're
27:23
approaching things and ramping up that conflict it just allows me to kind of
27:29
guide the book a little bit better and I love it so I did get quite a few of
27:35
these note cards done and I'm pretty excited to have made that much progress
A Big Moment
27:40
in just one afternoon session the other thing is this moment right
27:45
here so that moment was me
27:52
feeling like a piece of the story got unlocked and I've talked about this so many times but it is for me one of the
27:59
most fun magical exhilarating parts of being a writer and it has legitimately been about two years since I felt this
28:05
feeling and I missed it which is the feeling of something unlocking you know
28:12
like you're at your locker you're putting in the lock the combination a couple of different times and it didn't come open and then you feel that last
28:19
little piece fall in and you pull it down and it unlocks taking me back to high school I don't
28:24
even know if lockers are still like that anymore but that for me is the feeling when a story unlocks and sometimes for
28:30
me it is an image sometimes it's uh like a scene playing in my head like a movie
28:37
and sometimes it's a Twist that I hadn't figured out until that point and I'm
28:43
telling you that moment at the coffee shop yesterday when I you know I told you I had finished this rough draft but
28:49
it's really rough and part of the biggest issue still in my mind about this rough draft is how am I effectively
28:56
going to weave the past timeline in with the current timeline and make it really interesting and a lot of tension and
29:02
conflict and twists and turns and it just hit me like a ton of bricks
29:07
yesterday and it was so satisfying and so much fun and I'm just gonna give you
29:13
a bit of encouragement here that if like me for the past couple of years you have been struggling to find your magic your
29:19
joy the excitement of writing I promise you you have not forgotten how to do it you have not lost your mojo you haven't
29:26
lost your own magic you have it still if you have ever had it or if you've never
29:31
found it if you feel drawn to it you still have that magic and I know that
29:38
you can find it again if you feel like it's time just allow yourself to have fun with the
29:45
story again go back to the things that were fun about writing when you first discovered it for me it's been clearing
29:53
up my space clearing up my calendar I haven't been growing as fast on YouTube but man it is worth it to slow down
30:00
sometimes so that I can get back to my joy and I know that that is going to accelerate things in the long run and I
30:07
have held the faith now for two months that this writer reset of getting back to my joy cleaning up my space creating
30:13
room in my brain trying to get into a better focus mode I have had the faith
30:18
that it was going to pay off and I feel like yesterday proved that it is so edits are going well I'm going to
30:24
continue working on it today but that is the progress I have made so far and I'm excited to continue on with this so I'm
30:31
going to keep working on this plotting wall and then you know I'll keep you updated
30:43
but the days won't come show me life Show Me Love

hey guys welcome back heart breathing's I have been looking forward to this series of videos for a really long time
0:06
and I hope you have too we are starting today an eight part series on how to
0:12
write a series so I have an older series of videos on how to write a best-selling series but that one is really more about
0:19
how to indie publish a best-selling series in this particular series of videos we are going to be discussing how
0:25
to actually plan and write your series for publication so I am crazy excited
0:33
about this series of videos it's a series series so you're gonna hear the word series a lot if you have been
0:39
thinking about writing a series or you're currently writing or planning a series of your own I hope that you'll
0:44
subscribe to this channel and stay tuned to hear all about how to write a series we're going to get started right now
0:54
okay so let's go over the different things that we're going to be talking about in this series of videos so video
1:01
number one which you're watching now we're going to talk about the a little bit about the pros and cons of writing a
1:06
series we're going to touch on that and then we're going to talk about the different types of series because this terminology is not really consistent
1:14
across things so I want to establish a terminology and make sure that you understand that there are many different
1:19
types of series that you can write and often it depends on what genre you're writing in terms of which is the more
1:26
acceptable or the more commonly seen types of series in next week's video we'll be talking about character arcs
1:32
versus story arcs versus series arcs and how you handle that when you're planning your series then in the next video
1:39
number three we'll be talking about planning your series this is going to be a whopper of a video and as I haven't
1:46
recorded it yet as I'm recording this one I'm not sure if it's going to be a one part or a two part so that might
1:51
extend us to nine videos total because planning your series is huge when we get
1:57
to this video you're also going to have the opportunity to download a free series workbook that will help you plan
2:04
your own series and I've been working on that for a while and I'm excited to share that with you in just a couple of
2:09
weeks the fourth video is one that is one of the most requested things he on my channel which is how to create a
2:16
series Bible I have a previous video where I talked about how to create a series Bible inside a wiki but I didn't
2:22
go into all the nitty-gritty details of what you need to track how you can set it up a lot of different options so what
2:28
we're gonna do in video number four is we're going to talk about why you want to create a series Bible and we're gonna dive into the serious details of every
2:36
single thing you need to track in terms of all the things you plan to your world building your setting your characters
2:42
your story threads how you can set up that series Bible I will show you examples and then I'll talk about
2:47
several different places online or in your own home if you prefer to go the paper route that you can set up your own
2:54
series Bible in video number five we're going to talk about tips for marketing and publishing your series like I said
3:01
I've already covered some of this in a video series that I did early on on this channel called how to write a
3:06
best-selling series but I'm going to actually update that and give you some up-to-date tips on best practices for
3:12
marketing and publishing your series including how often should you publish how much should you write ahead of time
3:18
before you start publishing and all of those good things number six is something that we don't see talked about often enough I think
3:25
which is the emotional toll of writing a series so when you dedicate and you
3:30
commit yourself to writing a series that you might be writing over the course of five to ten years or even two or three
3:36
years you're really also dedicating yourself to an emotional journey of being with these characters writing this
3:43
series the ups and downs of how a series naturally ebbs and flows in terms of sales so we're going to talk about the
3:49
emotional aspects of writing a series and that's going to be one that really comes from the heart so I hope you'll
3:54
stick around for that in video number seven I am going to share with you my personal worst mistakes that I've made
4:00
as I have been writing multiple series so I've written more than five series here and there and I've actually just
4:07
started a sixth series so I do have a lot of experience not only with finishing series but with writing
4:12
different types of series and along the way over the last ten years I have actually made a lot of mistakes and
4:19
things that I wish I could go back and change so I'm hoping that I can share that knowledge with you so that you don't make the same
4:25
steak's I made and then finally video number eight will be a QA I haven't decided yet if I'm gonna do a live Q&A
4:32
or if I will let you submit questions ahead of time but we will do an author Q&A specifically talking about writing
4:40
series I hope that you're excited about this next adventure that we're going to go on together as it stands right now my
4:46
plan is to put out one video a week for the next eight weeks in this series the
4:51
videos will come out on Thursday and will be a company to buy a blog post as well as a newsletter out to my
4:57
newsletter list now Sunday's I also hope to post more of like planning type stuff
5:03
some of that is going to actually go nicely pair nicely with our series series some of it will just be fun stuff
5:10
like setting up a planter cart but I do have a little one at home so you never know when that video might come out on
5:16
Friday instead of Thursday so make sure that you're subscribed and turn those notifications on so that you'll get a
5:23
notice whenever a new video comes out from me you also want to check down below and sign up for my newsletter list
5:29
because when that series planner workbook comes out it will be exclusive for members of my newsletter list okay
5:36
so let's get started on video number one one of the things that is so incredibly important to understand especially if
5:43
you are hoping to make money writing what you love and really getting yourself out there particularly as an
5:49
indie author but series are just as important for trad published authors is writing a series so writing a series is
5:56
one of the most powerful things that you can do for your career why because it is
6:02
just a staple of marketing that it is easier to keep a customer and keep them
6:09
happy than it is to find new customers so you don't want to be grabbing new customers and then losing them and then
6:15
having to find all new customers and then losing them the foundation of a successful writing career is picking up
6:22
people along the way and then keeping those readers happy so you kind of have two jobs we talk about this a lot in my
6:29
published and thrive course so if you want to hear more about this definitely stay tuned for when that course and enrollment opens in just a few weeks but
6:36
it is so important for you as an author to not only be consistently bringing in new readers but also to hold
6:44
on to the readers that you have and readers love series I know there's always gonna be somebody listening that
6:51
says well I don't like series and I'm a reader okay I totally understand that but by and large most readers love to
6:59
latch on to a character and follow that characters life or they want to get immersed in a certain town or a certain
7:06
family and when you have something that links your books together readers are much more likely to follow on from book
7:13
to book to book so for example if you have a single protagonist in an urban fantasy series and she is somebody your
7:20
readers come to love then they're gonna want to know what she's up to next and how her story progresses same thing with
7:26
a mystery series when you have a detective you may have separate cases that that detective is following but if
7:32
they like the voice of that detective the they really relate to the backstory of that detective and they get really
7:38
interested in that that detective is going to be someone they want to continue to follow so even if you're
7:45
writing standalone mysteries you can increase your sales and your visibility
7:50
with readers and your sell-through with readers if you connect that mystery series with some kind of connecting item
7:57
like a town a type of mystery but frankly the most powerful way to do it
8:03
is with a single detective that you follow throughout the story once your reader is hooked on your characters or
8:10
your story world in some way keep them hooked and the way you do that is by continuing to write in that world
8:16
or write that family or write whatever it is that's connecting that series together and you will just sell more
8:22
books that way than if you wrote standalone books now I know there's gonna be some arguments and discussions
8:28
about this in the comments so I'll just go ahead and say that of course there are authors who write standalone and
8:35
there are on Rah's where stand-alones are more common like horror or sometimes
8:41
in like psychological thrillers where you've got that twist at the end there's really no follow-on to that but there
8:48
are still ways to connect your series and if you're interested in more about that definitely for my publish and thrive course but for
8:55
the purposes of this particular series of videos we are going to focus on the fact that for the majority of indie
9:02
authors as well as traditionally published authors the greatest way that you can build your career is to write a
9:10
series it is super super valuable and it is a great way to not only bring in new readers but also to hold on to them for
9:18
the long term there are lots of pros and cons to writing series as well one of which is the emotional toll a series can
9:24
take so I hope that you'll stick with me through the end of this set of videos so that you'll take all of these things
9:30
into consideration but in my opinion the pros far outweigh the cons in terms of
9:35
financial gain but most importantly in terms of the community that can be built around your books and the amount of
9:42
readers you can draw in and really build your career on in terms of loyal fan
9:47
base and loyal readership so let's talk about the different types of series because understanding the different
9:54
types of series that are out there and which type of series you in particular will be writing is key to understanding
10:00
the rest of the videos in the sequence so different types of series I have asked around amongst my author friends
10:07
and I have searched online and it doesn't seem that there is standard terminology around the different types
10:12
of series so I will just give these different types of series a name and we will move on from there this may not be
10:19
the name you're used to hearing it from and that's fine feel free to comment down below if you have heard these types
10:25
of series called something else but we just have to give it a name so you know what I'm talking about
10:30
so the first type of series that I'm going to talk about is what is sometimes
10:35
called a dynamic series it is also sometimes called an ongoing series or a
10:40
sequential series or a chronological series we for this purposes are going to
10:45
use the term dynamic I came across a blog post by kristen keifer at well storied I will link her blog post for
10:52
you down below and she called this a dynamic series and I really like that terminology I think I've also heard it
10:59
called a continuing series usually when I talk about my series I just call it a continuing series but that doesn't
11:05
totally work either so we're gonna call it a dynamic series and here's what it is a dynamic series is a series that is a
11:13
continuing story arc that extends over multiple books so this is not a series
11:19
that you could just jump in at book 3 and understand what's going on books do not stand alone so it is a
11:24
continuing story arc that lasts across multiple volumes with a dynamic series
11:30
you have to read these in order characters in a dynamic series evolve and grow pretty strongly throughout the
11:38
course of this series so usually in a dynamic or ongoing series you are going to see massive character growth
11:44
especially in your protagonist or whoever the main POV characters are so with a dynamic series each book has its
11:51
own story question or its own contained plot beginning middle and end has some
11:58
type of resolution however there is usually some type of overarching storyline or a big bad villain that is
12:06
the point of the entire series so you may find out about it in book 1 or you
12:11
may just find out the mystery in book 1 that gradually gets revealed throughout the story but each book has to build on
12:19
the next so you have to read book one to understand book two and you have to read one and two to understand book three and
12:25
so on and it is just like one long timeline of a story with each book
12:31
having its own contained story question that is answered by the end of it you will often see in dynamic series that
12:38
these books will end on not exactly a cliffhanger you can call it a cliffhanger if you want but usually
12:43
there'll be some type of resolution and then there will be some type of cliffhanger or singer at the end that
12:49
leads you into the next part of the story and this is the way that dynamic series tend to work some examples of
12:56
dynamic series that you may know is Harry Potter for example the Wheel of Time a Song of Ice and Fire which of
13:03
course is what Game of Thrones was built upon divergent for example in yaa or Twilight and for my own backlist my
13:10
shadow demon saga is a dynamic or continuing series the genres that you'll
13:15
often see dynamic series in are of course why a large portion of ye is this type of story where one
13:22
build one book builds upon the next and it's one big story fantasy is often the
13:28
same way most fantasy is written this way I would say science fiction can be this way as well and so is dystopian
13:35
often written in this way the next type of series that we're going to talk about is a standalone interconnected or static
13:43
series so this is a type of series where there is some type of unifying factor it
13:48
could be a setting it could be a character it could be an object in some cases but this is a series of books that
13:55
is self-contained these are self-contained stories that could be read independently so for example you
14:02
could start technically on book seven of the series and still understand the mystery the characters and get the gist
14:08
of what's going on these are standalone series in this type of series they can
14:14
usually be read in any order to some degree now with these types of series I will say that sometimes and often you
14:21
will get more out of the series and the character arcs if you follow them chronologically or if you read them in
14:27
order however they don't have to be read in order because there will be an independent storyline happening in book
14:34
six that doesn't necessarily rely on book 1 it's usually the character arc stuff that gets a little bit tricky
14:40
these types of books will often share a setting or a cast of characters but they don't necessarily always have the same
14:47
protagonist all the way through for the purposes of this particular series of videos we are going to call this type of
14:53
series that does not have to be read in order a standalone series you may know it as a different name like
14:59
interconnected or static but we're going to use the term standalone in standalone
15:05
series the character arcs are either completely static where the character barely changes at all or they're very
15:12
slow often like with a detective you might see some changes they get married
15:17
they change this relationship in some way or they reach out to their parents or their subplots where the character
15:24
sort of grows but it's not as massive of a character arc change generally as what
15:29
you see in a dynamic series the exception to this however is romance
15:34
in romance most of the series that you see are standalone series where each
15:39
book could stand alone but they're set around a particular group of friends or a particular town or a family like Bella
15:47
Andres the Sullivan series so there's something there that connects the people but each book is a different couples
15:54
love story in that case the character arc is self-contained so each character the male and the female or the male and
16:00
male female female whatever your couple is those two people will grow and change
16:06
as much as they're basically going to grow and change within that book and their character arc is self-contained
16:11
then when you move on to book 2 you will have a separate couple or even if you're doing menage a trio of people but
16:20
whoever is part of that romance group they will have their character arc self-contained to that one novel some
16:26
examples of a standalone series are Lee childs Jack Reacher series Bela Andres
16:32
the Sullivans James Bond which started as a book series and then of course was made into movies as well James Bond is a
16:39
great example of a standalone series in my particular backlist my Fairhope new
16:44
adult romance series is also standalone that set of books it's a six book series is set in the small town of Fairhope so
16:52
you have the town and the setting that is pulling people together but it's also set around a particular group of friends
16:58
from high school and in book one Lee Anne who was gone to school in Boston
17:03
has come home and that is the sort of inciting incident for the series but
17:08
each book is a standalone with separate couples the exception there being the first couple is also the sixth couple so
17:15
the same couple gets two books one and six but that is a standalone series and
17:21
even though there are subplots that tie things together and you would get more out of that series if you read it in
17:27
chronological order you could pick up book four and understand the romance between those two characters there may be some inside
17:34
jokes or some other references to characters that you've met in the past that you might not understand but for
17:40
the most part it is a complete standalone story in each individual book some common john Rosatti see writing
17:46
sandal Cirie's are like I said of course romance another one that you see this often in is mysteries like detective
17:53
mysteries and that sort of thing okay so there is actually I think a third
17:58
designation of series and I would call this a hybrid series I sometimes also
18:04
call this episodic so I think of this type of series a hybrid or episodic
18:10
series is one in which you technically have such a self-contained storyline
18:16
that you could pick it up anywhere in the middle and understand what's going on however there is so much going on
18:23
with the interpersonal relationships and there actually is an overarching storyline that comes out throughout the
18:29
story that you don't want to miss so in this instance we're talking about something like The Dresden Files so The
18:35
Dresden Files is a very popular really like crazy popular urban fantasy series
18:41
technically it's mystery series but it's urban fantasy mystery you could probably
18:47
pick up like book 7 in the series and you would still understand the basic idea of the world you could understand
18:54
the type of character that Harry Dresden is and you would understand the mystery of that particular story but you would
19:00
miss out on so much of that story world because you've missed the previous six
19:06
books and all of the interpersonal relationship and the character growth and the arc of Harry Dresden so I think
19:12
that there is a difference between this type of series and you could call it either one you could call it a dynamic
19:18
series and say absolutely you need to read that series in chronological order but you could also some people might
19:24
have the opinion that it's a standalone series and you could pick it up any old place and enjoy the story we will call
19:30
this type of series an episodic series for the purposes of these videos episodic series are often using a
19:37
mystery format mystery maybe not the main genre so urban fantasy for example
19:43
with The Dresden Files but it has a mystery story structure and a mystery pull to the story in this case of an
19:50
episodic story like this or an episodic series usually the mystery itself the
19:56
main mystery whodunit whatever it is is resolved by the end this story so you find out somebody died
20:03
your investigator goes to investigate the problem and by the end of it they do discover that this is the person that
20:11
killed them and that person is either defeated or sent to jail or whatever there's a resolution to that particular
20:17
mystery in the story however with an episodic mystery you're looking at
20:23
something where it's like that mystery then unlocks the door to an even greater mystery or a large organization or
20:29
something there pulls you through the story where you can't really get the
20:34
full story of what's going on unless you continue to read book two and three and four so with a standalone series you're
20:41
gonna get a little bit of that of course because every good writer is going to give you a little bit about the next
20:46
thing so like for example when you have illa Andres the Sullivan series you get to know that family so of course in book
20:54
1 you're gonna meet the sister and the brothers and everybody else and you're gonna want to know more about them so there are story threads that get carried
21:00
through however those threads are not as strong as like a mystery thread or
21:07
something that you just have to know and you won't fully get an idea of who this particular character is until you follow
21:13
them through the next seven books so to me that's the distinction is yes you're
21:18
going to have some interpersonal threads you're going to have some relationships and you're going to have some things
21:23
that aren't quite fully resolved like hey my sister isn't married yet and I want to know if she gets together with
21:29
her ex-boyfriend or not that's one question that can pull you through but really you don't have to read book two
21:35
to understand what was going on with the couple that you're reading right now the difference with an episodic series is
21:42
you are introduced to a detective or someone who like a set of brothers for
21:48
example that you really need to know more about their relationship and they are the main characters and there's
21:54
something about them that doesn't get carried through that that's a question that you still have about them going on
22:01
so with an episodic series if you read them out of order you you could read them out of order but you're going to
22:07
miss a lot of interpersonal relationships you're going to miss a lot of backstory you're going to miss a lot
22:12
of character growth and potentially some of the story truths that were like breadcrumbs spread
22:20
throughout the series so far often with an episodic series you will have standalone mysteries but there's an
22:26
overarching mystery as well so you've got like maybe mini bosses that the character is fighting for the first six
22:32
books but man book seven is the mega boss or the actual final boss and that's
22:39
the way I would say episodic series are typically structured like I said a couple examples of these are the Dresden
22:44
Files or yves dallas by Nora Roberts or a JD Raab you could read those out of
22:50
order but would you really want to so with all of these I would say it works on a spectrum so you might have an
22:57
episodic series that really is a little bit lends itself better to standalone than another episodic series you may
23:04
have an episodic series that really is so heavily interconnected that it borders on being a dynamic series so
23:11
there's not always going to be a set line between the three but hopefully you can through this information understand
23:19
what type of series you're writing and where you're blurring the lines but the main distinction that I would like for
23:25
you to understand as we move forward in this series series is that a dynamic
23:30
series has to be read in order there's no other way to understand it rather than picking it up at book one and
23:37
reading it all the way through to the end whereas an episodic series or a standalone series you could technically
23:43
pick it up anywhere and enjoy the story for what it is at that point and you're going to get mostly a complete story so
23:50
to pull from something that most of you have probably heard of or have some kind
23:55
of relationship with let's put it in terms of TV shows so a dynamic
24:00
television show would be something like Game of Thrones you can't really jump in
24:05
on season 8 of Game of Thrones and understand what the heck is going on and who all these characters are likewise
24:11
you can't jump into my shadow demon saga at book 7 and figure out what the heck is going on you have to have read book 1
24:18
and understand these characters and where they're coming from to understand the series that is a dynamic series Game of Thrones
24:25
a standalone series is something more like law and order so law and order they
24:30
get a case you may have the same detectives that are pulling you through depending on whether it's law and order
24:36
criminal intent or just the regular law and order or law and order SVU it's the detectives and the types of
24:42
cases that they get and how they solve them that can that connects the series but you could really jump in on episode
24:50
506 and still understand this mystery whodunit and it's a complete story and
24:55
you're satisfied you don't have to go back all the way to Episode one to understand what's going on in law and
25:02
order episodic however is something more like supernatural or the x-files so you
25:07
do have standalone episodes where you could point to it and you could say oh that's the episode where they find the
25:14
Drowned woman or that's the episode where such and such happens but there is so much interconnected or interpersonal
25:21
relationship character growth character arcs between the brothers or between Scully and Mulder that you really need
25:28
to understand then as you progress through those series there becomes an overarching storyline where a bigger
25:34
villain that crosses multiple episodes or multiple seasons is revealed and so
25:40
in that case I would call it episodic because I think you could step in on season four of the x-files and still
25:46
watch an episode and understand what's going on but you're not going to get as much out of it as someone who had
25:52
watched it from the beginning so those are kind of the way I would describe it in TV terms dynamic Game of
25:58
Thrones standalone Law & Order episodic supernatural if you have other examples
26:04
please feel free to add those in the comments below so another type of analogy that just popped into my head
26:10
when I was outlining this video is think of a dynamic series like a Victorian
26:16
house that you walk into it's a large beautiful house and it's just one single
26:21
structure you walk into the house and in order to really understand what's going on in that house you have to explore it
26:28
floor by floor you start in the basement and there's a complete story down there in the basement but you don't know the
26:34
story of the whole house until you move up to the first floor and then once you've explored the first floor you
26:39
have to move up to the second and then maybe the final boss that finally tells you what this whole house was about is
26:45
up on the third floor but it's all contained in this one house that's the way a dynamic series is you have to
26:52
explore it book by book in chronological order in order to understand the entire story because the story itself takes
26:59
place across multiple volumes a standalone series however is like a neighborhood so when you drive into the
27:07
neighborhood you see potentially dozens of houses there and each house is its
27:13
own contained story but in order to understand the entire neighborhood and
27:18
all of the things that interconnect it you have to go into each individual house but it doesn't really matter if
27:24
you start at the first house or if you drive down and go down to the blue house on the cul-de-sac they're all
27:30
interconnected and maybe sure you would get more pleasure out of starting with house number one and house number two
27:36
because by the time you get to house number three there's a little family photo of their best friends that you
27:42
wouldn't understand were their best friend's unless you had started in house number one and explored all of those photos but each individual house is its
27:50
own complete story that you can watch read and joy but there are multiple
27:57
houses all in one location connected by the town itself the setting or the
28:03
people who live there in episodic series however is more like a sprawling estate
28:08
so it doesn't necessarily have to be contained all in one house that you have
28:14
to go to in order maybe you start in the garage and then you go to the pool house and then you go down to the lake by the
28:21
where the boat is and you can explore all these different structures on all these different stories but really it's
28:27
tied together all in one big estate and eventually it's going to probably lead you to one main big storied several
28:36
storied house which is where the bigger like overarching series is contained so hopefully that makes sense to you it
28:42
makes sense in my brain that a dynamic series is happening all in one house that is made up of multiple floors where
28:48
you have to read them in order a standalone so your is more like a neighborhood full of houses that you can pick and choose
28:54
which ones you want to read and then an episodic series is that big grand estate
29:00
where you have multiple structures lots of different storylines that can stand alone but it comes together better as a
29:08
whole and you see the big picture if you view it as an estate that all belongs together so this is where we start this
29:15
is the foundation of understanding what type of series you are going to write and like I said once we get to the
29:22
series planning which is going to come in a couple of videos you will actually
29:27
get a workbook that will help you plan your own series and you're going to ask yourself some of these questions so it's
29:32
important to understand the difference between these three types of series I also briefly wanted to touch on the fact
29:38
that there is also something called a serial and this is a little bit different so if you would like a video
29:44
on the difference between a serial and a series please go ahead and hit the like button down below and make a comment
29:51
down below that you would like to see another video on the difference between a serial and a series because there are
29:57
some big differences there some people would say that a dynamic series is a serial but there's actually story
30:03
structure differences between a serial and a series and you can have a serial series so I know it gets a little bit
30:10
confusing so if you'd like to see a video talking about that make sure you comment down below and don't forget to hit that thumbs up button

31:37
[Music]
breathing's today I'm gonna be taking
0:03
you through a weekly plan with me and
0:06
showing you how I plan in my custom
0:08
pages I just kind of slowed it down
0:09
because I went through this really
0:11
quickly but I have a task list at the
0:14
beginning of every week that shows
0:15
exactly what I'm going to be working on
0:17
based on the three goals that I've set
0:19
and the planner that I've designed is a
0:22
goal-setting planner so it takes you
0:24
through how to set your main three goals
0:26
for the quarter and then you write out
0:28
your task list at the beginning of every
0:30
week you also write out where your
0:31
social media numbers begins that you can
0:34
see how they grow there's a section for
0:36
your blog or any other appointments as
0:39
well as for your work in progress and
0:41
now here is the weekly spread that I'll
0:42
be taking you guys through I just picked
0:44
out some washi tapes that I wanted to
0:47
use for the week and then I'm just
0:48
taking it out of the binder because it's
0:50
so much easier to actually like decorate
0:52
the pages once they're out also guys I
0:56
have this sticker binder that I've
0:58
created
0:58
I've literally spent the entire weekend
1:00
working on this but I downloaded a bunch
1:02
of stickers that I've purchased from
1:04
Etsy from printable shops so I'm gonna
1:07
be using some of those and pulling those
1:08
in in the coming weeks I also have a
1:10
ruler that I love my favorite tool pens
1:13
that I just picked up and a stencil so
1:15
let's get started
1:21
okay so this is the weekly spread in my
1:25
custom designed pages and so you guys a
1:27
good another chance to see kind of how I
1:29
use these weekly pages and I a get to
1:32
use these Halloween washes and stuff
1:35
that I've collected over the years and
1:37
don't get to use well I guess I could
1:39
use them any time of year but they're
1:41
especially nice to use this time of year
1:43
so a little bit of a black and gold
1:45
theme with the gold spiderwebs this week
1:48
but it's really fun to just use that
1:51
washi that you don't get to use very
1:52
often and I'll probably be doing a
1:55
little bit of Halloween decorating for
1:58
the most of the month of October just
1:59
because I enjoy Halloween so much but I
2:02
will link this little purple ruler down
2:04
below for anybody who's interested in it
2:07
I have absolutely loved it it actually
2:09
came in a pack of I think four so
2:11
there's a purple a pink a green one and
2:14
maybe a yellow one and they're just like
2:16
tiny little metal rulers but they've
2:18
been great for like pulling off the
2:20
washi for measuring things and they're
2:22
small and light enough to put into your
2:24
planner so I just tuck them into that
2:26
front pocket and I've really really
2:28
liked them and they weren't super cheap
2:29
off of Amazon so I will link that down
2:31
below and then this pin is the tool gel
2:35
pen with the needlepoint tip 0.5 I think
2:38
tip and I absolutely am loving these
2:42
pens right now even though I won't don't
2:44
think that my handwriting looks the best
2:45
in this plan with me but just hopefully
2:47
ignore that so in the left hand top
2:50
corner box I'm able to put my work in
2:52
progress which I'm still working on
2:54
deceiving darkness which is coming out
2:56
October 29th and then I'm working on a
2:59
short story called one wish I'm going to
3:01
be editing that up this week then I have
3:03
a little bit of a habit tracker that I
3:05
added there into the notes section so
3:07
I'm gonna be tracking meditation but
3:10
whether I hit my word count and whether
3:11
I post it in my Facebook group this week
3:13
and then those bottom boxes with the
3:16
check boxes I like to use those for
3:19
social media of course you can use them
3:21
for anything you want but I use them for
3:23
social media so I know for example that
3:27
I'm posting chapters of my book Sorrows
3:30
gift to Wattpad every day so I went
3:32
ahead and wrote
3:33
chapters are going up each day and
3:35
you'll see that I don't actually
3:37
pre-plan most of my social media tonight
3:39
but I will probably sit down and do that
3:41
on Monday morning but I like to go ahead
3:44
and kind of know what I'm gonna be
3:45
posting and then if I don't pre-plan it
3:47
then I'll just jot throughout the week
3:49
like what I did post so I can track
3:51
whether or not I've been posting and
3:52
that helps me like stay on track in
3:54
terms of posting to my Facebook group
3:57
posting to my Instagram and things like
3:59
that because for a couple weeks there I
4:01
didn't post much at all to my social
4:03
media because I just kind of needed a
4:04
break but this is one good way to see at
4:06
a glance like whether or not I've posted
4:08
all right so planning on Monday so with
4:11
this particular system since I have
4:13
daily pages I don't actually plan
4:15
hour-by-hour on these day little columns
4:19
all I do is take tasks from the columns
4:23
that I had written previously and sort
4:25
of assign them today so this isn't
4:27
necessarily a chronological part of what
4:29
I'm gonna be doing in my day but it just
4:31
kind of is sort of a to-do list of hey
4:35
these are the things they're gonna be
4:36
most important to do on Monday but what
4:38
I found when I only had a weekly view
4:41
was that I would plan out the week and
4:43
then let's say like at the top there on
4:45
Monday epi' update files and upload all
4:47
paperbacks well if something happens on
4:51
Monday and I don't have time to do that
4:54
then I've got the entire week already
4:56
planned out on my weekly view where do I
4:58
move that to so unless I was using
5:01
erasable pens which I do not like to use
5:03
or unless I was only planning as I go
5:06
there would be no way to modify my
5:08
schedule to say okay now I need to do
5:10
this paperbacks on Tuesday or Wednesday
5:13
and that's one of the things that I
5:14
loved about bullet journaling but what I
5:17
didn't love about bullet journaling was
5:18
just how much time it took for me to
5:20
make the pages look really good for me
5:23
and I've mentioned this on my channel
5:25
before but if my planner looks pretty or
5:27
I'm able to use pretty stickers and
5:30
pretty things like that then I get more
5:32
motivated to actually use my planner and
5:35
with a bullet journal I just felt like
5:37
it took so much effort to make it look
5:39
good because I'm not I don't have
5:41
beautiful handwriting
5:42
I don't really write or draw very well
5:46
so I need structure so this planner was
5:49
something that I designed hopefully to
5:51
kind of bridge the gap between a bullet
5:53
journal and you know needing that
5:55
planner structure but needing it to be
5:57
something that has daily pages that's
5:59
one of the reasons why I loved the hobo
6:01
Nietzsche as much as I did because it
6:03
was very similar to that and I sort of
6:05
designed my planner with what I loved
6:08
about the hobo Nietzsche in mind but the
6:11
hope of Nietzsche didn't have some of
6:12
the other things that I liked like that
6:14
weekly overview place to put your tasks
6:16
so this is just something that is
6:19
working for me but you can see there on
6:21
Monday I've got my writing goal I've got
6:23
that I'm going to edit this plan with me
6:25
that you're listening to or watching now
6:27
and then I'm going to work on a blog
6:29
post for Thursday I've also got a call
6:33
meeting with business mentor this
6:36
afternoon then on Tuesday I've got
6:40
another word count goal and then I'm
6:43
gonna be working on some sheets that you
6:45
guys will be able to download on
6:46
Thursday that will be some word count
6:48
trackers that'll be some free printables
6:50
for you someone to be designing those
6:51
and then it's so crazy but like I
6:54
ordered a bunch of things so I've got
6:57
several things coming in and it just so
6:59
happens that they're all coming on
7:01
Tuesday so I put a little happy mail
7:02
delivery sticker there because I'm gonna
7:05
be getting a lot of mail on Tuesday so
7:06
this is gonna be a super exciting day
7:09
for me and I probably will film an
7:11
unboxing for what I'm getting some of
7:13
the stuff I'm getting in the mail on
7:15
Tuesday it's super fun and then I also
7:17
added this little but first coffee
7:19
sticker and this is one of the only
7:20
stickers that I did not actually print
7:23
out as well as that emoji sticker on
7:26
Monday but this little but first coffee
7:28
came from stick with me shop and her
7:30
stickers are so so cute I love them so
7:33
much
7:33
alright so then on Wednesday I am
7:36
probably going to be going out to write
7:37
at Barnes & Noble with some of my local
7:39
friends I am super super lucky in that
7:42
most of the year ever since nano a lot
7:46
of the people that I met during nano
7:48
that are local writers here in the
7:50
Charleston area have been meeting up at
7:52
the Barnes & Noble on Rivers Avenue on
7:54
Wednesdays in the morning
7:56
and you know sometimes it's only two of
7:58
us sometimes it's five or six of us but
8:00
it's been so good to have that group of
8:03
local writers to rely on and go meet up
8:06
with that's been just amazing I'm so
8:07
grateful for it
8:09
so I'll probably be meeting with them on
8:11
Wednesday and then also I'm gonna be
8:13
working on recording the video that will
8:16
go up on Thursday I'll probably record
8:19
that on Wednesday afternoon because I'm
8:21
definitely not ahead on videos but
8:23
that's okay
8:24
so I also just went ahead and added that
8:27
I'm gonna post that video on Thursday as
8:29
well as some other meetings and stuff
8:30
that I have for this group I'm a part of
8:32
called freshly implemented on Thursday
8:34
then I also went to the notes section
8:36
and marked real quick that the New Moon
8:39
is on Monday so that's always something
8:42
good for me I am very much a believer in
8:45
energy that comes along with the moon
8:47
cycles so I like to do some different
8:50
rituals on the night of the new moon
8:52
just some like meditation light a candle
8:55
welcome new things into my life new
8:57
beginnings so I made sure to mark that
9:00
on my calendar and then on Thursday
9:03
again I went back and added that I'm
9:04
gonna be working on the undated version
9:07
as well as the quarter 1 2019 version of
9:10
my planner and if you are interested in
9:13
this planner and you're an author and
9:14
you'd like to check it out it is linked
9:17
down below this is like my one thing I
9:19
have for sale on Etsy I just opened my
9:21
own Etsy shop and so far I've been
9:23
getting a lot of really great feedback
9:24
on the planner so thank you guys so much
9:26
everyone who has purchased it there will
9:29
be an undated version as well as some of
9:32
the 2019 versions going up soon so look
9:35
out for those then I've got family beach
9:38
time on Wednesday evening as long as I
9:40
get the recording and everything done in
9:42
time we're gonna go and spend a couple
9:43
hours at the beach on Wednesday
9:45
afternoon then I found this little
9:49
sticker
9:49
that I put on Thursday afternoon this is
9:51
answer comments and it's a little
9:53
keyboard and I love that because I've
9:55
been falling a little bit behind on
9:57
comments because it's just a lot of work
10:00
to keep up with to YouTube channel it's
10:02
my blog all of my social media and stuff
10:04
so I'm doing my best to respond to every
10:06
comment but I'm gonna set aside some
10:08
time specifically on thirst
10:10
to go back and try to hit all the
10:11
comments that I haven't hit yet and then
10:13
on Thursday evening I'm gonna be
10:15
practicing my presentation because on
10:18
Friday I will be taking a road trip to
10:21
Raleigh and I'm gonna be speaking at the
10:25
HC RW or heart of Carolina romance
10:27
writers all-day workshop and I am so
10:30
excited to be a keynote speaker for this
10:32
workshop along with Sabrina Jeffrey's
10:34
it's gonna be amazing so if you're in
10:36
the Raleigh area I hope that you will
10:38
come join us it's gonna be an amazing
10:39
day it's gonna be really fun but I'm
10:41
speaking on how to thrive as an indie
10:44
author talking about not only the
10:46
marketing side of marketing and strategy
10:49
side of being an indie in today's market
10:51
but also the mental game of indie
10:53
publishing so it's gonna be really great
10:55
so I just marked on my planner that imma
10:58
be listening to book 3 of The Wheel of
11:00
Time guys I've been reading The Wheel
11:02
time series it's incredible but these
11:04
books are so long even the audio books
11:06
are like 30-something hours long and so
11:09
it's a really good opportunity to listen
11:12
to a big chunk of that book driving all
11:15
the way to Raleigh and all the way home
11:16
so hopefully I'll be able to do that
11:18
then I'm also marked that I'm gonna be
11:20
writing in my hotel room so that's gonna
11:22
be awesome hopefully I can get there
11:25
early enough to get about 5 to 7,000
11:28
words and I might do some kind of write
11:32
with me or something so be on the
11:34
lookout for maybe a youtube live or
11:35
something coming up next Friday or this
11:38
coming Friday then I just marked the
11:40
all-day workshop on Saturday and the
11:44
title of the workshop and then I wanted
11:45
to make sure to get pictures or video of
11:48
like what I take with me when I travel
11:51
if that's something you guys are
11:52
interested in seeing let me know because
11:54
I was thinking it might be cool to kind
11:56
of show like what I bring in my laptop
11:58
bag and so forth like when I'm actually
12:00
writing on the go I also have a writing
12:03
retreat coming up next week so that's
12:06
gonna be like 4 night writing retreat so
12:08
I think I might also do some like a
12:12
little bit of a vlog of what I do when
12:14
I'm on a writing retreat if you guys are
12:16
interested in seeing that alright so
12:18
then on Sunday I'm going to try to wake
12:19
up early and get a couple thousand words
12:21
in before I leave hopefully I'm going
12:23
also get a chance to see some of my
12:25
friends from when I used to live in
12:27
Raleigh and stay you know in touch with
12:31
them and then head home in the afternoon
12:33
and listen to will time on the way home
12:36
which will be another large chunk of
12:38
that book and then in the evening I'm an
12:40
arrest and plan for the following week
12:42
so that is pretty much my entire week
12:45
ready to go and again most of these
12:48
stickers I got from a couple different
12:50
sticker shops on Etsy that I was able to
12:54
just download and print them myself
12:56
except for like I said there's one that
12:58
but first coffee is from stick with me
13:00
shop and then there's a couple little
13:03
cute like bald looking kids that is an
13:05
emoti which is from the coffee monsters
13:08
Co and this is my first time ordering
13:09
from her shop but oh my gosh they are so
13:11
cute okay guys so this is a slow glance
13:17
look at the completed spread I know that
13:19
my handwriting is not the best of this
13:22
week but I am pretty pleased with how it
13:26
came out overall I am just now getting
13:28
the feel for using these new stickers so
13:30
this is the first time I got a chance to
13:32
use them so I think I'll try to
13:33
incorporate them more one of the great
13:36
things about actually buying printable
13:39
stickers off of Etsy is like most of
13:41
these boxes are custom designed for the
13:45
Erin Condren but my Erin Condren isn't
13:48
an inch and a half across and mine are
13:50
only an inch and a quarter in this
13:52
custom planner in the a5 so I was able
13:54
to resize them for how I wanted it to
13:56
look so that was nice and then here's
13:58
just a glance at my daily page so a lot
14:02
of you asked like what do I do with the
14:03
daily page so on the left hand side
14:05
there I have a schedule so this is just
14:09
my basic schedule for how my time its
14:11
gonna go and then at the top I have my
14:13
top three priorities and then in the big
14:15
box in the middle I have basically what
14:17
equates to my to-do list and then I
14:20
track my sprints in the bottom left and
14:22
then a place for any notes that come out
14:25
throughout the day so like how it was
14:26
feeling or any journaling or anything I
14:28
want to do and then here's another
14:30
glance at that tasks page so at the
14:33
beginning of every single week you can
14:35
write down your tasks based on your top
14:37
three goals for the quarter and of
14:39
course in this planner I walk you
14:40
through how to set those goals and then
14:42
there's you know section for any
14:44
appointments or other tasks your work in
14:47
progress your growth tracker your blog
14:49
tracker and just any other place like to
14:53
mark your like top priorities for the
14:55
week so I like to schedule out the tasks
14:58
that I'm going to do or figure out which
15:00
tasks I'm working on and then in the
15:02
weekly spread I actually decide what
15:04
today is I'm going to try to tackle
15:05
those tasks as well as tracking my
15:07
social media and then on the daily page
15:09
is when I get very detailed about what
15:12
I'm going to do for that day and that
15:15
way I can stay flexible so like if
15:17
something that I plan to do on monday
15:19
doesn't get done then on Monday night
15:21
when I'm setting up Tuesday I can just
15:23
very easily move that or migrate that
15:26
item over to Tuesday's to-do lists so
15:29
that's how I like to plan and I love
15:33
having that weekly overview and then
15:34
having that daily page so for me this
15:36
really really works so let me know in
15:39
the comments do you like having a daily
15:41
page or the weekly is enough for you
15:43
what I found is that a lot of the daily
15:46
planners like simplified planner the day
15:48
designer stuff like that they don't
15:49
actually have a weekly overview and that
15:52
was one of the main complaints I had
15:54
about the simplified planner they have
15:55
the monthly page and then it's a li page
15:58
but nothing that was like a weekly
15:59
overview and I really love to see my
16:01
week at a glance so my solution was to
16:04
design my own pages but if you found a
16:06
planner that you love I hope that you'll
16:08
mention it in the comments because it's
16:10
a very personal thing like trying to
16:11
find the perfect planner and hopefully
16:14
at this point I have down planner piece
16:16
and I'm enjoying it for now so hopefully
16:18
you guys enjoyed this plan with me and
16:21
hopefully you've enjoyed seeing the
16:22
progress for progression of me learning
16:25
how best to plan my weeks because it
16:27
really is a progression you just you
16:30
know you keep learning as you go and
16:32
it's ever-evolving but hopefully we're
16:35
all moving towards something that's
16:36
gonna get us a little bit more
16:37
productivity and a little bit more joy
16:39
in our lives so alright guys that is all
16:42
I have for you for today I hope you have
16:44
an amazing week and I will be back on
16:46
Thursday talking about how to track your
16:49
word count as well as have
16:51
free downloadable printable for you that
16:54
you can use hopefully during NaNoWriMo
16:56
or anytime that you're going to be
16:58
checking your word counts in your novels
17:00
so alright guys that is it for now and I
17:03
will see you on Thursday bye
17:09
[Music]
hey everybody welcome back to hard
0:02
breathing's today we are going to be
0:04
doing a September playing with me yeah
0:11
so welcome back to my channel I've got
0:13
my Kiki ka5 binder here and I've picked
0:17
out just some washi tape that I want to
0:18
use as well as I'm gonna be using this
0:20
Swarovski Hello Kitty pin and some
0:23
stickers that my friend Jen got for me
0:25
when she was in Japan then I also have
0:28
just what I've done since we're getting
0:30
close to the end of the year is I have
0:32
printed out just some basic plain
0:34
calendars from Google calendars and
0:36
already started planning ahead all my
0:38
video content and then I have a stencil
0:41
and a couple different pins the pigma
0:44
micron and a fabric hostel Pitt artist
0:46
pin and just a variety of stickers some
0:48
of which I made myself and like these
0:51
for example those colorful ones are from
0:53
the simplified planner with Emily Leigh
0:55
and I'm not using that planner so much
0:57
as I thought I would but I am using the
0:59
stickers so here we go this is a
1:02
September layout that I have custom
1:04
designed for myself and I'm pretty happy
1:07
with how it turned out the basic layout
1:10
here is just that I have the September
1:12
at the top with 2018 on the right side
1:15
then I've got the basic monthly calendar
1:18
and a note section there on the left and
1:21
that is kind of like a dotted line there
1:22
and then I've left room in the middle
1:24
for the six ring hole punch and then I
1:27
specifically designed the bottom part of
1:29
the page to fit normal size of washi
1:32
tape because it drives me crazy when I'm
1:35
planning and I want to decorate the page
1:37
with some washi tape at the bottom and
1:39
there's not enough room and it covers up
1:42
part of the calendar so it's like if I'm
1:44
gonna design my own I'm gonna make it
1:45
fit regular sized washi tape so kind of
1:48
a little self-indulgence there and of
1:50
course I already had placed the washi
1:52
tape on it just to test it out when I
1:53
printed it so all I'm going to do now is
1:57
I'm just going to start filling out the
1:59
days that I know I'm going to have
2:01
videos coming up this month and so what
2:04
I did actually yesterday was I printed
2:07
out those Google Calendar sheets that
2:09
are just blank sheets so if you want to
2:12
do that all you have to do
2:13
let's go to you know search for Google
2:16
Calendar and if you look for the little
2:18
system cog it's like a little icon on
2:21
the top right side of the Google
2:23
Calendar you can click on that and
2:25
underneath it you can select that you
2:27
want to print and if you deselect any of
2:30
your calendars that you're using like I
2:31
have a calendar that has my son's school
2:34
stuff on it and then my husband stuff
2:36
any doctor's appointments so I just
2:38
uncheck those before I go to print and
2:41
then you can print any number of months
2:43
you just set the dates that you want to
2:44
print so I printed out calendars for
2:48
September October November and December
2:50
and I like to do this because it's a
2:52
pretty much a free way other than a
2:53
sheet of paper to have a calendar that I
2:56
am just going to kind of brainstorm on
2:58
and I'm not going to worry about like
3:00
making it pretty or anything like that
3:02
and what I did was just cut down some
3:05
post-it notes to fit the boxes of the
3:07
printed page and that's how I was
3:09
planning out my editorial calendar and I
3:12
don't know all of the videos but thanks
3:14
to a lot of you that send me emails or
3:16
chimed in on the comments about what
3:18
types of videos you'd like to see coming
3:20
up as well as some videos I already had
3:22
planned I feel like I've got a pretty
3:24
good handle on the content that I'm
3:26
going to be putting up on this channel
3:28
for the next few months or really for
3:31
the rest of the year there's a lot of
3:33
exciting things coming up so I'm really
3:35
trying to get everything organized and
3:37
excited for everything that has got to
3:39
get done before 2019 so what I'm doing
3:43
here is I actually wrote notes up at the
3:45
top or I have a little section for notes
3:47
and I've actually covered it myself and
3:50
just put a little am writing sticker
3:52
there to show that what I'm working on
3:53
this month is deceiving darkness is my
3:56
current work in progress then I put
3:58
another strip of washi tape there and
4:00
just a pink sticker that I made on my
4:03
Cricut and I'm writing out the word
4:04
projects because I have if you've
4:07
watched any of my planning videos the
4:09
way I like to plan is to have three main
4:11
goals related to my business and for me
4:15
my business now includes both my writing
4:17
and my heart breathing's which is the
4:20
channel that you're watching now so I
4:22
have those three main goals and then
4:24
underneath those goals for the 90 days
4:26
or for
4:27
this quarter which includes Childress in
4:30
September I have a bunch of projects
4:32
that I want to get done throughout the
4:34
90 days and so what I'm doing here is
4:36
I'm marking the projects that still need
4:38
to get done and then I'll be working on
4:40
in the month of September now I do have
4:43
another sheet in my planner that lists
4:45
out all the tasks underneath this
4:48
project this type of planning is very
4:50
detailed but it has saved my life you
4:53
guys I have gotten more done in the last
4:55
year that I've gotten in the last three
4:57
years combined because of this type of
5:00
system of setting the three main goals
5:02
and the projects and then detailing it
5:04
down to tasks now I do have some videos
5:07
coming up where I'm going to explain a
5:09
little bit more about that process but
5:10
I'm gonna be going in depth on this and
5:13
helping you set up your own tasks and
5:15
projects and your main goals for q4 in a
5:18
three day bootcamp that'll be coming up
5:20
towards the end of the month I'm
5:22
planning to run at September 21st 22nd
5:25
and 23rd it'll just be an online boot
5:27
camp and I haven't fully decided on the
5:29
pricing of that yet I definitely since
5:32
this is the first time I want to make it
5:33
a little bit more affordable but it is
5:35
going to be kind of an intensive thing
5:36
where you go and set up your plan so if
5:39
you're interested in that make sure that
5:40
you are signed up for my newsletter list
5:43
at heart breathing's calm I will link
5:46
that down below but I'm pretty sure it's
5:48
gonna be $99 for the three-day boot camp
5:50
and that will include access to a
5:52
Facebook group where we're gonna help
5:54
you work through all of your goals
5:55
projects and tasks for the next 90 days
5:58
and have hopefully what's going to be
6:00
the most productive quarter of your year
6:02
so far so anyway as you can see I have
6:06
written underneath projects I've used
6:07
just some of these Emily Lake
6:09
color-coded stickers to mark my projects
6:12
that I'm going to be working on for
6:13
example I'm going to be working on my
6:15
quarter for goal planner that are gonna
6:17
be some printables including this
6:19
monthly sheet that you are gonna be able
6:21
to purchase in my shop upcoming soon
6:23
also the 90 day bootcamp needs to get
6:26
finalized I'm going to try to put out
6:29
ten videos so that's up there deceiving
6:31
darkness my paperbacks that I want to
6:33
get done I want to start a fan art
6:36
Friday so that is part of my projects
6:39
for this month
6:40
want to finish up my promo calendar for
6:43
the rest of the year and then I have
6:45
some work I want to do on my keywords
6:46
inside my books on Kindle so I'm gonna
6:51
be working on that project as well then
6:53
at the bottom there on the left hand
6:54
side I wrote extras and these are things
6:56
that are like I don't have to get them
6:58
done this month but it's just things to
7:00
be keeping in mind and things I would
7:02
like to work on so self-publishing
7:04
course that I've been working on and
7:06
actually have given this course several
7:08
times before but I would like to offer
7:11
that to people who win an arai mo and
7:13
are interested in learning how to self
7:15
publish and actually anybody on this
7:17
channel if you guys are looking for a
7:18
more in detailed course or walkthrough
7:21
on how to upload to Kindle and how to
7:24
get everything that you need done and
7:26
how to upload to Google Play and where
7:28
all you can upload and all those details
7:30
that go into self-publishing I'm hoping
7:32
to have a course ready by January and
7:34
again I don't have a name for that but
7:37
I'm hopefully going to be working on
7:38
that now then I have a couple of courses
7:40
that I am taking myself that I have
7:42
written down there as well as two
7:44
different hashtags on Instagram that I
7:46
want to follow and you know continue to
7:49
participate in this month which is a
7:51
hashtag read write plan which is a
7:54
planner and writer hashtag if you'd like
7:56
to join in and another one is hashtag in
7:59
story mo which is run by I believe run
8:01
by the NaNoWriMo group starting to get
8:03
ready for NaNoWriMo coming up in
8:05
November gosh it's coming up soon so the
8:09
other things that I have done here is
8:10
I've got these little pink Play buttons
8:13
those are the videos I hope to upload
8:15
for Heart breathing's and then the
8:17
purple play buttons are the ones that
8:19
are for my Sarah Canon YouTube channel
8:22
which is my author YouTube channel would
8:23
just geared more towards fans than it is
8:25
for authors but of course if you would
8:27
like to follow that channel you are more
8:29
than welcome and I would love to have
8:30
you over there I will link that down
8:31
below as well I do some like writing
8:33
vlogs and like what's in my laptop bag
8:35
and stuff like that and I'm also like
8:37
reading some of my favorite scenes from
8:39
books as we lead up to the release of
8:41
book 10 so also if any of my fans are
8:44
watching this it's kind of like a little
8:46
spoiler I'm hoping to release decieving
8:48
darkness which is book 10 in my series
8:50
on Friday September 28th so I
8:53
placed a sticker that I got from Erin
8:55
Condren that I used my book cover to
8:57
create that circular sticker down there
8:59
on the 28th with the sign that says two
9:01
seeming darkness release day and that I
9:03
should have written it in pencil because
9:04
it's not set in stone because the book
9:06
is not finished and I'm actually way
9:08
behind on it but I am hoping to get a
9:11
writing retreat or a few days at a hotel
9:13
this month to try to catch up on that so
9:18
then all I've done is write in the
9:19
videos that I know for sure that I'm
9:21
gonna be getting out so this little
9:23
preview of what's coming up on my
9:25
channel and like I said I planned all
9:27
this stuff out before I wrote it in my
9:29
calendar I planned out on those Google
9:32
Calendar sheets just as something that I
9:34
can kind of brainstorm and move around
9:35
that's why I did them on post-its
9:37
because I could write out something that
9:39
I knew I wanted to do and then move it
9:41
around on the dates depending on how it
9:43
best seemed to fit into my schedule so
9:45
I've got now I've written them down in
9:47
pen and hopefully these will be the
9:48
videos that come out then on Thursday
9:52
coming up this week Thursday the 6th I
9:54
put a little pink bow there which that
9:56
sticker also came from the simplified
9:57
planner website from Emily Leigh I have
10:00
a 2 p.m. a speed masterminding which is
10:03
a business course that I've been taking
10:05
this year like a business group I'm in
10:07
called freshly implemented with Amber
10:09
McHugh and we do monthly speed
10:12
masterminding on video chat so - coming
10:15
up on Thursday so I marked that and then
10:17
I also marked that on the 13th Thursday
10:20
there is Power Hour which is another
10:22
like hour-long sort of mini masterclass
10:25
with amber McHugh where she teaches us
10:26
different things about business and I
10:29
highly recommend freshly implemented she
10:31
does a plan a thon every year that's
10:33
like a free face book you know getting
10:36
ready for next year and I think that
10:37
usually runs in November or December so
10:39
I will look definitely let you guys know
10:41
when that comes out because it's just
10:43
incredible and Labor Day obviously is
10:47
the third which is tomorrow hopefully I
10:49
will get this video up today which is
10:51
the September plan with me that's up
10:53
September 2nd I'm a little bit late
10:55
getting my monthly done and then I just
10:57
took a few of these cute Hello Kitty
10:59
stickers or Sanrio stickers and sort of
11:02
decorated at the page a little bit and
11:04
then I took out this Michaels
11:05
recollection sticker
11:07
and I was looking for like a coffee or
11:09
something that would be kind of cute to
11:11
put up in that space since that whole
11:13
first week basically of September has
11:15
nothing on it because September did not
11:17
start until Saturday so just a little
11:20
decorative thing there and I might add
11:22
more things to this calendar as the
11:24
month goes but so far this is pretty
11:27
much what I have coming up for the month
11:29
of September and it's a lot of videos
11:32
and guys this is going to be a lot of
11:34
writing as well as launching my next
11:38
book and I do hope to have a video for
11:40
you guys in October talking a little bit
11:42
about how I get ready to launch a book
11:45
so I won't tell you about it before the
11:47
book launches but what I would like to
11:50
do is after oh and oh my son furious
11:53
little Pikachu in there I forgot that
11:54
was in there I'll just leave it but I
11:57
have plans to show you guys how I got
12:01
ready for my book launch and how I got
12:03
everything set up and what I do to get
12:06
ready for a book launch and hopefully
12:08
that'll be something interesting to you
12:10
guys coming up next month and that
12:12
little blue flag there's just that this
12:14
is a deadline of the book has to get
12:16
done and be at the editor by the 18th
12:18
and note later so I left that there and
12:21
this is my September monthly and just as
12:27
a bonus look here I basically take some
12:29
of these just a bigger calendar sheet
12:31
that you can get pretty basically from
12:33
anywhere like staples or whatever and do
12:36
the same thing like replicate what I did
12:38
in my planner on my bulletin boards that
12:39
it's right there and I can see it every
12:41
day and then also at the top of my
12:43
bulletin board I have my 90-day
12:45
milestones which are my what I want to
12:47
have done by 30 days 60 days and 90 days
12:49
and it's kind of hard to see but a lot
12:51
of those have been highlighted as done
12:53
then I have my 90 day Kanban board and
12:56
I've actually been doing probably better
12:58
than ever but as you can see that green
13:00
is the place where I've sort of fallen
13:02
behind which is my writing so this is
13:05
the month that I need to catch up on
13:06
that alright guys that is it for my
13:09
September plan with me I hope that you
13:11
have enjoyed this and that you're
13:12

13:14

13:36
[Music]

hey what's up you guys a bit of a bonus
0:02
video this week I recorded this actually
0:05
last weekend but I decided to go ahead
0:07
and do the voiceover and show you guys
0:09
how my new planer setup is working for
0:12
me and how I have it set up for the week
0:16
[Music]
0:18
okay so this is just a glimpse at last
0:22
week's which is kind of the week before
0:24
at this point but I've set up a
0:25
printable of my own where on the left
0:28
side there I have my top three goals
0:30
goal number one goal number two and goal
0:32
number three that I've set up for my
0:33
planning for the 90 days and then I
0:35
write out my tasks that I'm gonna work
0:37
on then over on the right-hand side I'm
0:39
tracking my growth my work in progress
0:41
my blog and my top priorities for the
0:43
week then you turn the page and I've got
0:46
my weekly setup which includes you know
0:49
videos I want to do and instead of
0:51
tracking my time I'm tracking my social
0:53
media and all my to dues that I have my
0:55
daily pages that have my time and my
0:57
schedule I'm not exactly sure yet how I
1:00
want to use that top section but these
1:02
are just printables that I've designed
1:03
I've got my schedule there on the left
1:05
and then I write my kind of daily to-do
1:07
is in the middle and then any notes I
1:08
have about the day go down at the bottom
1:10
and this has really been working well
1:12
for me and I love this system of having
1:14
the daily pages right after the weekly
1:17
that's been great for me and then on
1:19
this last page after Sunday I have a
1:21
weekly review that basically just asks
1:23
like am I on target to hit my goals what
1:26
deadlines do I have coming up how is my
1:28
overall mood this week how can I make
1:30
next week better so that review kind of
1:33
gives me an overview of how I did the
1:35
previous week and gets me looking
1:37
forward to what changes I can make for
1:38
the following week and how I can make it
1:40
better so what I'm gonna do now is I am
1:43
going to set up this past week so I did
1:46
this actually last weekend and recorded
1:48
it but I just didn't have time to do the
1:50
voiceover until now so this is gonna be
1:52
kind of a plan with me as well as I flip
1:54
through so I pulled out these pigma
1:56
micron pins which I really like and I
1:58
always go back and forth on what pins
2:00
and then I pulled out an assorted
2:02
selection of washi tape that is gonna be
2:05
kind of my color theme for the week and
2:07
I have just been since I printed or made
2:10
these printables for myself
2:12
I kind of designed them with washi tape
2:15
in mind and knew kind of where I was
2:16
gonna put them even though it's not
2:17
exactly perfect ratios and actually
2:19
since I designed these I have gone back
2:23
and paid for a subscription to Adobe
2:25
InDesign so that I could design some
2:27
that are even better because these I
2:29
designed in Word and the lines aren't
2:30
exactly right and things aren't the way
2:32
I wanted them to be and I've had enough
2:34
people asking me about my printable
2:37
schedules and stuff that I'm thinking
2:39
about offering them for sale so if
2:41
you're interested in purchasing some of
2:43
these weekly spreads or a 90-day goal
2:46
planner it's what I really want to do is
2:47
it's kind of my dream right now is to
2:49
put together a 90 day writing goal
2:52
planner that has some of these elements
2:54
but set up for the entire corner so if
2:55
you're interested in that definitely let
2:57
me know so that I can be working on
2:58
getting that designed and up before at
3:01
least before the beginning of the year
3:02
but potentially if there's time before
3:05
the end of this 90 days since we'll be
3:07
starting a new one October 1st which is
3:09
so hard to believe this year has flown
3:11
by so on this first goal task page I've
3:16
got the date and then I've got what week
3:18
number it is so 90 days it's about 13
3:22
weeks so every quarter is around 13
3:24
weeks so this is week number nine of the
3:27
quarter and I like to keep track of that
3:28
to see kind of how many weeks I have
3:30
coming up left and you can't necessarily
3:32
see it in this video but I have put dot
3:35
grid here but I still use a stencil to
3:37
help keep track of it and what I'm doing
3:39
is I'm just writing out so if you
3:41
followed my 90-day planning I set
3:43
outcome goals so goal number one is
3:45
basically to write and publish or
3:50
publish and promote both new and
3:51
backless titles to increase my income to
3:54
a certain amount so I've got projects
3:56
set up for that goal to help me achieve
3:58
that goal and then within those projects
4:00
I also have tasks so what I've done here
4:02
is I've noted specific to that
4:05
particular goal what tasks am i working
4:08
on this week so one of my projects under
4:10
goal number one is to finish and get my
4:13
paperbacks for all my old books
4:15
published and updated so I've been
4:17
working on re-editing and reformatting
4:19
those so then I've got a checklist here
4:21
of the ones that I wanted to get done
4:22
this week
4:23
then a second project for this 90
4:26
is to get cover art booked for a new
4:30
series coming up and then another one is
4:33
just some admin stuff that needs to get
4:35
done with my promotion and that sort of
4:37
thing so I've got some updates that need
4:40
to get done and this does not as much
4:43
directly apply to the goal of publishing
4:47
promoting but it's just sort of admin
4:48
work that goes into that and then of
4:50
course writing the book that I'm
4:52
currently working on is one of the major
4:54
projects so my tasks related to writing
4:56
that book are to get 30,000 words this
4:59
week and to finalize my scenes list
5:01
which is part of my plotting process so
5:03
then I move on to goal number two and
5:06
goal number two is basically my fan
5:10
engagement goal and that goal is to
5:13
increase my fan engagement by a certain
5:16
percentage on all these different
5:18
platforms and YouTube is one that I've
5:21
been working on and this is not this
5:22
channel on youtube but my Sara Canon
5:24
channel that is more for my fans which I
5:27
just launched this 90 day so these goals
5:29
are you know launching the YouTube is
5:32
the the project and then the tasks
5:34
underneath it that I'm going to be
5:36
tackling this week are to record a video
5:38
on bitter demons create a post for it
5:41
and that sort of thing so I listed those
5:44
that I can check them off then another
5:46
part of my strategy for promoting or for
5:49
keeping my fan engagement up is working
5:52
on my newsletter so I have down there to
5:55
email a friend of mine that it's going
5:56
to help me with a new funnel like a
5:58
Welcome funnel for my fans to stay more
6:00
engaged and then another part of my
6:03
engagement with my fans is I wanted to
6:05
start planning a fan art Friday
6:08
competition and also some t-shirts that
6:11
I want to send for giveaways and
6:12
completing some new t-shirt ideas to get
6:15
some of those on sale so that's part of
6:18
goal number two and then goal number
6:19
three has to do with continuing to post
6:22
and promote Heart breathing's which is
6:24
what you're watching now this channel
6:26
and blog for authors and so part of that
6:30
is another youtube goal to get the plan
6:33
with me done to get that plotting video
6:36
number six done that just came out
6:38
yesterday and so you'll see me write
6:40
down
6:40
all of those types of tasks here for the
6:43
week now all of the tasks that you see
6:45
me write down here what I do after I
6:48
write them down here is I go to my
6:50
Kanban board so if you haven't seen my
6:52
video on how I set up my Kanban board
6:54
for 90 days you can go back and watch
6:56
that I'll make sure to put a card up
6:58
here somewhere so you can see it but I'd
7:00
go back to my Kanban board and I take
7:02
all of these tasks and I give them a
7:04
sticky note if they don't already have
7:05
one but most of these already do and I
7:07
move them down to the middle section
7:09
which is my doing section what I say on
7:13
my Kanban is I it's called the
7:15
get-it-done section so that when I walk
7:17
into my office every day of the week
7:19
I can actually see okay these are the
7:21
things that I'm working on specifically
7:23
this week and I know that I don't have
7:25
to worry about anything that's not on
7:27
that list and sometimes I won't even
7:29
move all of these tasks down on day one
7:32
what I'll do is like if I have to see
7:33
for example that long list of paperbacks
7:35
I'll just move emerald darkness down to
7:37
the done what are doing lists so that I
7:40
don't feel like overwhelmed by
7:41
everything that needs to get done but as
7:42
soon as emerald darkness gets done and I
7:44
move it down to the bottom
7:46
awesome job section then what I'll do is
7:49
I'll move Forgotten darkness from the
7:51
to-do list down to the middle so I know
7:53
that's my next task it just kind of
7:55
depends on my mood and that's probably
7:56
the better way to do it because then you
7:58
feel like you're being productive all
7:59
week long so once I have that basic set
8:03
of goals already you know put down
8:05
written down I know exactly what I'm
8:07
gonna be working on for the following
8:08
week I will write out any other tasks or
8:11
things that are not directly related to
8:13
my goal but that need to get done this
8:15
week so for example I have filed an
8:16
extension for my business and that is
8:18
due so I've got to get that done for
8:20
taxes which then reminded me of
8:22
something else that I needed to get done
8:24
for my promotion then I also have a
8:26
growth tracker here where I'm tracking
8:28
my social media and you can see I kind
8:30
of brought in my newsletter there at the
8:31
bottom because I forgot to add that to
8:34
my growth tracker so it'll go on the
8:35
next version of this then I write down
8:38
the book that I'm working on that I'm
8:39
plotting and writing and how many words
8:41
I want to get written at the end of the
8:42
week they'll come back and write in how
8:44
many words I actually accomplished then
8:46
I wanted to keep track of my blog posts
8:49
and he Tube videos so I have a little
8:51
section there when I write what I'm
8:53
going to be working
8:54
for my blog this week and then I can
8:56
check off as I go whether the post is
8:57
written the images are done I've shared
8:59
the post etc then I have just another
9:02
little questionnaire for myself like
9:04
what are my top priorities for the week
9:06
so I've got this huge list of stuff to
9:08
do but what's the most important things
9:10
that need to get done and then I ask
9:12
myself what will I do to be as
9:13
successful as possible so for this past
9:15
week I wrote in that you know I'm going
9:17
to get up early and I'm going to go to
9:21
the beach a lot make sure to relax when
9:23
I do get a chance to relax so that kind
9:25
of stuff is important and it's just kind
9:26
of a little mental reminder of the
9:28
things I need to do to stay successful
9:30
and to make sure that I'm taking care of
9:32
myself so that I don't burn out so now
9:34
what I've done is I've moved over to the
9:37
weekly pages and you'll see next week a
9:42
way that I have changed these in
9:43
InDesign and they look so much better
9:45
than this more plain one but this is
9:47
kind of just a basic outline of what how
9:49
I wanted to use my weekly pages but you
9:52
can see I've got a column an empty
9:54
column on the left side with a place to
9:56
mark what promotions I'm doing this week
9:58
on the left then along the bottom I have
10:00
all my social media icons and I'm pretty
10:02
sure that legally when I want to sell
10:05
some of these printables I'm not going
10:08
to be able to put those social media
10:10
icons on there so when I've designed
10:12
this in InDesign the icons are not there
10:14
but I still plan to use that section in
10:16
the same way but you if you bought these
10:19
for example you could use that section
10:21
in any way you wanted you could write
10:22
your daily word count or you know
10:24
whatever you wanted to do and for me in
10:26
my planning I have just found that on my
10:30
weekly view my main goal is to take
10:33
those tasks that I know I want to get
10:35
done through the week and figure out
10:37
which day's I want to get them done on
10:38
so for example writing needs to get done
10:41
usually every single day but when it
10:44
comes to some of these other things and
10:46
you'll see me constantly kind of go back
10:48
and reference how I set up this spread
10:50
last week because this is kind of a new
10:52
system for me so I'm kind of seeing like
10:54
how did I set that up so you'll see me
10:55
flipping back and forth a little bit but
10:58
basically the way I like to use like
11:00
Monday Tuesday and Wednesday column
11:02
since I didn't put any time there and
11:03
it's just doc bread I like to just put
11:06
on there
11:07
what tasks and what things I need to
11:09
remember for the day so they'll be maybe
11:11
a daily writing goal there will be if I
11:13
have a chiropractor appointment or I
11:15
have something that must get done like a
11:18
thing at my son's school or something
11:20
like that those types of things that are
11:22
time related will also go on there even
11:24
if they're part of my personal life now
11:26
I don't put my meal plans or my fitness
11:30
or anything like that on this because
11:32
it's mostly like what is something
11:34
that's gonna take time away from work
11:35
and what am I going to be working on for
11:37
my actual career and my job and I have a
11:40
different planner that I keep my meal
11:43
plan in and I actually just filmed a
11:45
meal plan with me that's I know a little
11:47
bit off topic for this channel but if
11:49
you're interested in that you can look
11:50
back from last weekend and I did a
11:53
little glimpse at how I'm meal plan for
11:55
the week so the way I'm using this
11:58
left-hand column is I am just keeping
12:01
track again here of which videos I need
12:04
to record so that I can mark them off
12:05
throughout the week and this is both for
12:07
my Sarah cannon Channel and for this
12:09
heart-burnings channel so the plan with
12:11
me that's what I'm finishing up today I
12:13
plot video number six I also want to get
12:16
a September plan with me which I'll be
12:18
hopefully recording tomorrow since it is
12:20
already going to be September which is
12:21
just so crazy to me
12:23
and then bitter demons is of the video I
12:26
have planned to get done for my Sarah
12:29
cannon channel and it has not gotten
12:31
done because I've had such a busy week
12:32
so that might get pushed to next week so
12:35
we'll just see if I can get it done
12:36
today or not and then below that I have
12:38
a list of emails that I want to send
12:40
because I think this section will change
12:42
from time to time it's just is there
12:44
anything else I need to be tracking this
12:47
week and that's how I use it then at the
12:49
bottom of the page I marked a couple of
12:51
different promos that I had going on
12:52
this week so I've got a Facebook ad
12:54
going on my beautiful demons box that
12:57
and then my book was featured as the
12:59
Cobo daily deal this week and I actually
13:01
wrote it down on Monday because it
13:03
started Monday night but Tuesday was the
13:05
big actual day in the US so I just went
13:08
ahead and marked it on Monday because
13:10
that was the day my book got marked down
13:12
but I like to kind of keep track of any
13:14
promos that I have going on so that I
13:16
can help promote them on my Facebook
13:18
page or mention them to my fans or
13:20
whatever
13:20
other support i need to get okay so
13:23
they're on Monday you can see I put my
13:25
word count goal was five thousand words
13:27
and I wanted to get six Sprint's I like
13:29
to work in Sprint's of twenty five
13:32
minutes with five minutes in between of
13:34
a break so that was my goal for Monday
13:37
and then I wrote down the Cobo daily
13:39
deal then I also had an 8:30
13:40
chiropractors appointment and I wanted
13:43
to get four of those paperbacks done I
13:46
did not actually hit the four paperbacks
13:49
but when I don't hit a goal like that
13:52
I just will go in very bullet journal
13:54
style and I'll X out the ones that I did
13:56
get done and I'll put a little forward
14:00
arrow on the ones that want to move to
14:02
another day and this is why I really
14:05
really love having both a weekly part of
14:08
to my plan like this as well as the
14:10
daily pages because I can set up my plan
14:13
for the week and then if it if it falls
14:15
through I don't have to worry about oh
14:16
it said I'm doing it on Monday I just
14:18
know this is something I wanted to get
14:20
done this week if it didn't get done on
14:21
Monday no big deal where else can I fit
14:23
it in and then I have the daily pages to
14:26
sit down and actually write what I've
14:29
gotten done or what still needs to get
14:31
done so I can you know look up my Friday
14:34
for example today and say oh that plan
14:37
with me didn't get done yet even though
14:38
I had it written down first day to do on
14:40
Tuesday and so now I can add it to my
14:43
Friday daily page and then it don't have
14:46
to worry about like crossing things out
14:47
or getting really messy on my weekly so
14:49
the weekly is more of just of planning
14:52
my intention whereas the daily is where
14:54
I actually keep track of what got done
14:56
and so that system really works for me
14:58
and if you've never tried both weekly
15:00
and daily pages I suggest you give it a
15:02
shot and see if it helps you feel a
15:04
little bit less overwhelmed and less
15:06
like you're running out of time so on
15:10
Tuesday I set up to record several
15:13
videos with bitter demons which did not
15:16
get done plot video number six which did
15:18
and my edits on that video and then the
15:21
posting of the plan with me which is
15:23
what you're watching now which of course
15:24
I didn't get to until Friday so I don't
15:27
always stick to you exactly what days
15:29
because life happens and I fall behind
15:31
but it has been helping me
15:33
with this system to still get things
15:36
done within the week that I intended to
15:38
get them done and to feel like I'm a lot
15:39
more in control of my days then later I
15:42
had to send off endure promo stuff and
15:45
follow-up emails which got done and then
15:47
paper backs of finishing up deep dark
15:50
secrets and emailing my cover artist is
15:52
up there and some of that got done some
15:54
of it did not and then of course my
15:56
writing goal for the day then on
15:58
Wednesday this is when I wanted to have
16:01
my taxes done which they're still not
16:03
done so that's another thing that's
16:04
gotten forwarded on I ended up going to
16:07
Barnes & Noble to meet with friends and
16:09
ended up spending most of the day out
16:10
working on my book and then of course on
16:14
Wednesday I also wanted to get edits
16:16
done for plot number six video write the
16:19
post that goes along with that and
16:20
schedule my newsletter so those are some
16:22
things that I was able to cross off on
16:24
Wednesday and you'll see some throughout
16:26
I'm using a combination of just my black
16:30
pens some basic stickers that I get from
16:33
the happy planer sticker books as well
16:35
as some stamps that I've gotten now some
16:37
of these have also come from the happy
16:39
planner and some of them have come from
16:40
the sweet stamp shop but I really enjoy
16:43
using stamps and they're a way kind of a
16:46
more inexpensive way to get similar
16:50
things on your planner without having to
16:52
rebuy the stickers every time but they
16:54
can be a little bit messy and they don't
16:56
always come out like perfect so just
16:57
kind of I think depends on your own
16:59
perfect tolerance for whether or not you
17:02
like you know things feel like maybe a
17:04
little bit less than perfect or how well
17:06
you do with that kind of thing I don't
17:08
mind for it not to be perfect but it's
17:10
just kind of up to you if you would like
17:12
to use stamps or not but I've found them
17:14
helpful and I like the way they look in
17:15
my planner so I've been using those as
17:17
well so on Thursday I had a two o'clock
17:21
mastermind meeting with a business group
17:24
that I belong to and if it got cut off
17:27
but I did go back and just add the dates
17:29
to the top so you'll see that when i
17:31
zoom out later
17:32
I also a plug for a new book bub ad
17:36
which is something if you're not
17:38
familiar with book bub ads those are
17:40
it's a newsletter list for discount
17:42
books and you need to apply at least
17:44
like a month before or around them
17:46
before you want the feature deal and
17:48
since I have a new release coming out
17:50
next month I wanted to make sure to put
17:51
that in my planner for part of my
17:53
promotions goal then I had a goal of
17:56
writing five thousand words and then at
17:58
five-thirty had a parent's association
18:00
meeting so actually I think I'd go back
18:01
in and add that later then I also knew
18:04
that on Thursday afternoon I wanted to
18:06
work on some of my admin work and I just
18:08
wrote that really big and I will write
18:10
that a little bit more specifically on
18:12
my daily page as to what needs to get
18:14
done but I know that in the past some of
18:16
you have asked me like okay so you've
18:19
got these 90-day goals but what about
18:21
the maintenance kind of stuff what about
18:22
the stuff that doesn't necessarily
18:23
pertain to a specific outcome goal but
18:26
is the things you've got to do every day
18:28
like responding to comments or you know
18:31
your daily writing or just the other
18:33
kind of admin work like responding to
18:35
emails and getting some of those things
18:36
set up so I just try to set up time at
18:39
least once a week to do just purely
18:42
admin stuff responding to emails getting
18:44
things sent out responding to comments
18:47
and I also will squeeze that stuff in
18:49
like oh I'm cooking dinner so while the
18:51
you know oven is going or the veggies
18:54
are cooking I will squeeze in answering
18:57
and responding to comments but if you
19:00
need for all that stuff to go on a goal
19:01
you can work out a goal that is all
19:03
about keeping up with your maintenance
19:05
and your admin work so that you don't
19:07
feel overwhelmed it's just about how
19:09
things work for you then on Friday which
19:12
is today I wanted to take a beach walk
19:14
which we will go and do after lunch and
19:16
I'm working on this blog tube is hive
19:18
and you guys may have seen this before
19:20
because I've been meaning to get started
19:22
on that course for a while and I just
19:23
have not had time so hopefully today I
19:25
will get to it then this is the day I
19:27
wanted to email my friend about funnels
19:29
and setup begin to set up my new funnel
19:32
for my fans and then plan my heart
19:35
breathing September video content and I
19:38
did post yesterday's plot video that I
19:40
would love for you guys to give me some
19:42
feedback on what videos you would like
19:44
to see coming up and some people did
19:46
email me and let me know that you'd like
19:48
to see more stuff on self-publishing and
19:50
about how to plan and plot out your days
19:53
so any suggestions that you have if
19:56
you're having trouble with anything that
19:57
you think I might be able to help
19:59
with or you've heard me say something
20:00
before that you want me to elaborate on
20:02
please don't hesitate to ask because I
20:04
started this channel to help serve other
20:07
people to help share what I know and of
20:09
course I'm not perfect and I don't know
20:11
everything but if there's anything that
20:12
I can help you with please just let me
20:14
know and comment below and let me know
20:16
kind of what topics you might want to
20:18
hear about in the future so I'll be
20:20
planning that September content and
20:22
probably working on my content for
20:23
quarter four throughout this weekend
20:26
then I wanted to go ahead and contact my
20:28
cover artist to book her for this
20:30
butterfly series I have coming up and I
20:33
want it to work on InDesign which I am
20:35
going to be playing with this afternoon
20:36
then my weekend is mostly going to be
20:39
focusing on family and working on
20:42
deceiving darkness which is my work in
20:44
progress so I want to get 5,000 words on
20:46
Friday and on Saturday and then any
20:48
catch up to it my 30,000 word goal can
20:50
come on Sunday I also want to continue
20:53
to work on my planner pages and my
20:55
goal-setting pages that I'll be offering
20:57
up for sale and quarterly planner and
20:59
then on Sunday I would like to if I
21:02
can't get to it tomorrow film my
21:04
September plan with me edit it and get
21:06
it up right away and then of course I
21:08
always on Sundays will do my meal
21:11
planning for the week and order my
21:12
groceries I usually get them through a
21:15
grocery delivery system or service
21:17
called shipped so that saves me a lot of
21:19
time although this weekend I imagine the
21:21
traffic is going to be really bad in
21:23
front of my house because I live really
21:24
close to the beach and we're like right
21:27
by the bridge which is the only way
21:29
people can get to the beach so it's
21:30
probably going to be ridiculous traffic
21:33
this weekend so I don't know I might
21:35
need to plan my grocery shopping for it
21:37
this afternoon instead and then what I'm
21:40
doing is I'm just going down and marking
21:41
down anything in my social media or post
21:44
that I know I want to get done now this
21:45
typically gets spilled out throughout
21:47
the week but I do know for example that
21:49
I'm posting one chapter to Wattpad every
21:52
day so I marked that in first and then I
21:55
knew that I was going to be promoting
21:56
the Cobo daily deal so I wrote that down
21:58
and I knew which day I wanted to post my
22:00
youtube video that did not actually get
22:03
done on time so the rest of the week I
22:05
just go in and add stuff as I think of
22:08
it and maybe eventually I would love to
22:10
get to a point where
22:11
and planning all of that social media
22:14
way in advance and can write down every
22:16
single topic but for now I'm just
22:19
actually just have the place holder for
22:22
it and then I go in and add the other
22:24
stuff later so that is how I have set up
22:28
basically everything for the week and
22:31
now all I do is I go in and I add the
22:33
washi tape to kind of decorate and the
22:35
dates for the daily pages but I don't
22:37
actually fill those in I like to fill in
22:39
the daily pages with what I plan to get
22:41
done tomorrow so I will fill in
22:43
Tuesday's goals on Monday night for
22:45
example that way I can let my week kind
22:48
of flow as it wants to without having to
22:50
set a rootbeer strict or rigid schedule
22:53
I can just decide what needs to get done
22:55
the night before and then follow through
22:56
as best I can
22:58
if you guys like this system and you
23:00

23:01

next time bye
23:28
[Music]
hey everyone and welcome back to heart breathing's today I have an exciting video for those of you who have been
0:05
hoping to write a longer series because we are going to talk about how I created a series Bible inside a wiki so I'm
0:13
going to explain to you what a wiki is why I decided to use it and how it works so well for my series Bible so this has
0:24
been a super highly requested video because a lot of people out there who are writers are writing a world in which
0:30
you've got multiple stories being told and once you start getting deep enough
0:36
into a series you really need some kind of series Bible so what is the series
0:41
Bible a series Bible is basically just a record of all the true things about your
0:46
series anything about the town the people anything that is actually Canon
0:51
like that has been written into your story that you know is the truth so that when you get five books in and you try
0:58
to remember the name of that guy who she went in and talked to at the pharmacy you'll be able to go back and look and
1:05
see what was his name rather than having those pesky inconsistencies that tend to pop up when we don't keep track of that
1:11
the other thing is it's going to help you a lot in your writing because instead of having to go back to the book
1:16
search for the name try to find out what you called this person or whether he had blue eyes or green eyes or whether the
1:24
pharmacy was next to the library or the library was next to the grocery store or whatever thing you've already written
1:29
into your series instead of having to go back and spend the time reading through your series and trying to figure out
1:35
what you had put or guessing and getting it wrong and then ending up with things
1:40
completely all a mess throughout your series where it's inconsistent throughout you'll just be able to go in
1:46
take a look at what you've written down in your series Bible and find it so much
1:51
easier when I first started writing the shadow demon saga back then it was called the peach fell high demon saga
1:58
I had six books that were in my original story arc and I didn't really start
2:03
needing a series Bible until I was about four books in and then I started moving into the fantasy world of my story
2:10
everything up to that point in the first four books happen in the town of peach Ville which is an imaginary town in Georgia which is
2:17
pretty much modelled after the town I grew up in which is the town of Hawkinsville Georgia a small Georgia
2:22
town and so it was kind of easy to keep track of things I did have really an
2:27
unofficial series Bible I just had one of those three-ring binders with a bunch of like college-ruled
2:33
notebook paper in it and I would just jot things down like here's this character Maryann and she's got blue
2:38
eyes and she has black hair and here's some basic things about her so I had a few pages that were sort of the
2:44
beginning of my reference material but when I started working on book 5 I
2:50
started realizing okay now we're moving into the shadow world and I've got this fantasy aspect and there's all these
2:55
characters starting to show up there's all this backstory in the world is just getting bigger the books are getting
3:01
bigger there's so much more to the world and I realized that this binder that had
3:07
a bunch of scribble scratch on it was really not serving me so I created a new
3:12
binder instead of doing a lot of there wasn't a lot of like YouTube videos or anything else about how to create a good
3:17
series Bible so I didn't really know what else to do so I just made a new binder with prettier paper probably some
3:24
washi tape on it and I started getting more specific about the types of information that I tracked made sure I
3:30
had you know eye color hair color and all the basics but I also would say like this these people were here at this
3:36
meeting these people weren't here's how this types of magic work and started to make reference to the types of magic
3:43
like I started to kind of reference the magic system itself but what I found over time especially when I finished the
3:50
main six book arc and I started to go into writing some character backstory
3:55
and then writing for POVs in the world expanded yet again was that having a binder that had limited amount of
4:02
information and I had to keep like turning through the pages to find anything still left me opening up a PDF
4:08
of my book or a Word document of my book and searching for things constantly and I even had an assistant at the time that
4:15
I would have to send her notes as I was writing book 7 and say can you tell me what what I said about the moons in the
4:22
shadow world because I can't remember if I said there were four moons or six moons and if I said you know what colors
4:28
they were and all this stuff and I started to get confused because especially with a fantasy world you start to have all of these huge things
4:35
in the world building that you need to track so basically what I decided to do
4:40
when I started to talk to my husband about what a pain-in-the-butt this was to try to keep this in a binder where it
4:46
was just like physically written was he said to me well at work we keep a wiki
4:51
so the official definition of a wiki is a website that allows collaborative
4:57
editing of its content and structure by its users so it's basically if you think
5:02
about wiki's you probably think about Wikipedia which allows a lot of people to go in and edit the information and
5:08
add articles and different things like that so that can be valuable especially if you have an assistant or like when I
5:14
was working on the willow Harbor series with three other y-a and na authors it was great because we were able to create
5:20
a wiki and that we could all go into whereas if you were creating something just in a Word document or even in your
5:26
onedrive if you were trying to be collaborative it just wouldn't really be as easy because you can't collaborate as
5:32
well on some of those other programs whereas a wiki is just created on a website and as long as you add to those
5:38
users to your wiki everyone can update it and change it and so forth so that
5:43
can be really great and useful if you're doing collaborative things or if you're having someone else help you with your wiki like if you enrolled the help of
5:51
some fans to go in and add to the wiki or whatever then you don't have to do it all by yourself and it's easy to
5:57
collaborate the other great advantage to using a wiki for this is that wiki's are
6:02
very easy to like cross link so I'm going to show you examples of this once
6:07
we get into the actual excretion the fact that you can easily cross link and cross reference and cross post and
6:14
access stuff very easily that way and move easily between webpages is so super
6:19
useful you can also insert images maps you can have a page for every single character you can have an entire section
6:26
dedicated to the magic system or to the world-building you can have you can just create endless number of pages and you
6:32
can link them together or group them in any way that you want and other thing that you can do super easily that makes this amazing is you can
6:39
search most wiki's have a very powerful search function so when I've created my shadow demons wiki for example I can
6:46
just go into the search box and I can easily say moons and it's going to pull up every single instance of when I've
6:53
used the word moon so if I'm you know on deadline and I'm trying to go through my edits and I'm trying to search through
6:59
and figure out what in the world did I say about the moon's like is it seasonal is it this or it's that and I can't
7:05
remember then I can easily just go into my wiki page search moons and it's gonna pull up every instance and then I can
7:10
find that page find where I referenced it and it's super easy of course it's
7:15
only easy because I've put that information into the wiki so if you're just getting started as a writer and you
7:22
see that you're going to have or you plan to have a longer series especially in a fantasy world but this would work
7:28
in a romance series also where you've got a town where there's recurring characters or particular places that you
7:34
revisit you know all of this stuff can be important for just about any type of series you write but I find it's
7:39
particularly useful with fantasy and magic system type things where you're in other worlds and there's magic types
7:45
that you know you you're using different elementals and different things like that because it can just be hard to keep
7:51
all that information up in your brain so anyway you do if you're if you're just
7:56
the beginning of this process I highly recommend that you don't wait like I did until book 6 or 7 or if you know five to
8:03
start chronicling and journaling and your research and all of the facts about your series because if you start while
8:10
you're writing and just make it a part of maybe your editing process or your final read-through process that you go
8:16
through and you begin to create this wiki for every character in that first book for every truth or fact that you
8:21
put into the book about the world or the people you're going to be so much better off and you're going to save yourself a
8:28
ton of time in the long run you can just trust me on that but if you're like me
8:33
and you're further into a series and you're just now looking for a really great way because you have the need to
8:38
organize your series better then definitely keep watching because I'm going to show you some examples of how I
8:43
set up my own wiki and why it's working so well for me so I will just give this
8:49
a slight caveat that one of the challenges to recording this video was that I want to show you real-time
8:56
examples of why a key is so powerful however I can't show you my actual
9:01
shadow demons wiki because there are tons of spoilers in there and this is
9:06
such a huge series for me and I just can't afford to put any spoilers out there plus there's things in there that
9:12
haven't happened yet that may not happen so I don't want to put out spoilers or expectations and have anybody stumble
9:18
across it and be like oh my gosh this is gonna happen or oh my goodness that's who the High Priestess was all along
9:24
because it would pretty much ruin my series so I'm just not going to take a risk and put that actual information out
9:29
there so what you're going to be looking at today is a fake wiki that I have created specifically to show you an
9:36
example of how you can set yours up so this of course is not going to be as like spiderwebbed
9:41
as my current wiki in terms of the cross posting across linking it's definitely not going to be as beefy in terms of how
9:48
many pages I have set up for this other series that has you know over a million words written in it but hopefully it
9:53
will still give you a good example of what a wiki looks like and how it functions so that you can use this for
9:59
yourself also at the end of this video I will be giving you some alternate ways that you can create a digital series
10:04
Bible that doesn't involve using a wiki but let's get started with the actual
10:09
view of a wiki okay so this is where we get to the fun part I'm going to show you a sample wiki and I like I mentioned
10:17
before I'm not going to show you one of my like completely done wiki's because there's just too many spoilers in there
10:23
and things that my fans don't even know about the series because I work ahead so I can't show you that but I'm gonna give
10:28
you an idea of at least the functionality that you can find in a wiki I'm also going to just give you a
10:34
little bit of a disclaimer here because PBworks calm is what I use so I'm gonna
10:39
go just that main website for you real quick this is not a like a glowing
10:46
recommendation that this is the best like private wiki out there I honestly
10:51
just use this because my husband was familiar with using it in a collaborative way in a corporate structure and so I just used it because
10:58
it was free and it worked so I'm not giving any kind of like recommendation this is the best one out there it's just
11:03
the only one I've tried so if you don't like the looks of this one you might be able to find a different one you might
11:09
even be able to find a wiki that's specifically tailored toward storytelling this is more of a corporate
11:15
one and PBworks has lots of different products but you would go to their main site PBworks comm click on wiki's and
11:22
find their wiki hub and when you click more you will go to the slash wiki's HTML and there you can get started and
11:29
create your own so just a little disclaimer there that I'm not saying this is like the very best wiki you can
11:35
find it's just the only one I've ever used so I believe that most wiki's are kind of put together in a similar way
11:41
and they function in a similar way if you guys would like to see if you if you like the idea of this series Bible in a
11:48
wiki and you'd like to see a walkthrough of exactly how to set one up from scratch because what I'm gonna be
11:53
showing you is one that already has some pages and things done for you then just
11:58
let me know and I can start from scratch and create one for like a new or upcoming series and show you guys that
12:04
process but for now I'm going to show you one that I've put together for you specifically for this video that I've
12:10
just called sample wiki and all of my wiki's are on this site and they can
12:15
kind of talk with each other so I'll show you that functionality as well but basically on your wiki you have a front
12:21
page that you can just put like the name of your series you can put some book covers here I've got the books in my
12:28
series listed as well as I just threw on some tag lines that have worked well in different kinds of advertising that I've
12:36
done just to keep track of those tag lines and all I had to do to set this up is you can see over here this little
12:42
pencil here that's an edit button and you just edit this like any page like on
12:48
your blog or anything like that you have basic functionality that's just like you
12:53
can build things underline change the colors the format the font the size you can add source links you can add links
13:00
you can add images if you wanted to so if you look over here you can say insert links or I can go to images and files
13:06
and if I wanted to add like another book cover or something I've got a few different files here so if I wanted to
13:13
add the shadow demons book cover I could add that I could move it around whatever I wanted to do so all
13:21
you have to do to upload a new file is click upload files and you could add in different things from your desktop or
13:28
whatever so I have just added my box that which is my series opener for the
13:33
shadow demon saga but you could add you know basically you can create anything it's just a blank page you can put
13:38
whatever you want on the front page when you're done editing you can click Save and now it becomes just a static page
13:48
another thing that you've got over here is this navigator on the right side that will show you all of the different
13:55
folders that you've created and then you'll have different pages and this is where the functionality of the wiki
14:01
really starts to come in handy you can also navigate from up here at the top where it says files tasks members and so
14:08
on I'll talk a little bit about members and adding people as a collaborative thing toward the end of the video but
14:15
for now let's talk about just the basic functionality for keeping a series Bible so as you see I don't have everything
14:24
linked here but I do have one book linked in my regular wiki that has all
14:30
you know all of this that I've put years of work into everything is linked here so all of the books in the series would
14:37
be linked to their own page but since I just made this as a quick sample for you it's just a few things that are linked
14:44
what I love about using a wiki as a series Bible is this way that everything
14:53
that's a text on a certain page can interact with text from another page it
14:58
just makes it so incredibly easy and it makes it super searchable so let's say I
15:04
come into the front page of my wiki and I know I'm gonna be doing a little bit of research about this book shadow
15:10
demons then I would go to the shadow demons page because it's linked there and it's gonna automatically bring me to
15:16
book force page now like I said as I'm creating the wiki I'm gonna create a page inside my books folder you can see
15:23
over here it's in the books folder that has every single book in my C or and so the information that I've just
15:31
got up here on the simple sample wiki is the title of the book what number of the series it is I've got a link that goes
15:37
out to my web page so you can see this is just like the website page for the
15:44
book in case I wanted to see like the links for where to buy it I have the publication date as well and a book
15:49
cover and then I start out with the summary of the book so of course I
15:54
didn't put the full summary in here because that would take a lot of time but I just sort of started with a
16:00
summary this book opens with Mary Ann Harper and Jackson exploring the ruined crow village they're looking for any
16:06
sign of a book that will give them information on how to release Harper from her role as peach Belle's Prima so
16:12
just to give you an example again of the amazing interconnectivity of the pages I
16:18
would have each one of these characters could have their own page the crow
16:23
village could have its own page as a place in my places folder Peach Bowl could have its own page and I actually
16:30
have created a page so I'm going to show you how to link that in just a second but all the characters can have their own pages so if I get to this and I'm
16:37
sort of researching for the next book and it says okay this book opens with these three characters but I'm like okay
16:42
I want to see what I say about Harper all I have to do is click on her name and it takes me to her page and then on
16:50
each character page like you can create a page for each character in your series no matter how small or how big and you
16:57
could star them if you want it so there's a little star here so that you could navigate to that page a little bit
17:02
more easily from the front page now I'll show you that as well I've just got some
17:07
very basic information about Harper she is the main character in my shadow demon saga so of course in my Rhett real wiki
17:15
this is a really really long page because I have a lot of things about her and how much she's changed over the
17:22
course of like a million words that have been written about her but as a basics for every character I keep their name
17:28
and then any kind of note about them so in later books she discovers her true name is Harper Brighton that's why she's
17:34
Harper Madison Brighton she's age 15 at the beginning of book 1 and I might even like I
17:40
believe in my other wiki I have a thing about her age and how she ages up in
17:46
each book so she's no longer 15 obviously by the book 10 which is the
17:52
most recent release her hair color is blonde her eye color is brown other descriptions like I said I would
17:59
probably have a lot more than just this you could put anything you wanted to put about known quirks like if she has a
18:05
signature smile or tics that she does like she often bites her bottom lip so I
18:10
would probably put that in there because it's just a characterization but what I've added now just to show you how the
18:17
pages can interact is that she's known to wear a ribbon around her wrist and you'll see that ribbon is linked and
18:23
I'll show you where that goes in just a minute I also will include a place where I put her relationships to other
18:30
characters just so I can remember now of course because she's the main character of my series it's an easy thing for me
18:36
to remember how she relates to most of the other main characters but if I
18:41
wanted to remember for example that she had a single encounter with this very
18:48
minor character that might come into play in a later book this is a place where I could put that I could put the
18:54
minor character's name and then I could link to their page but also have just a
18:59
little bit of a description about what their encounter was so for example here's this ends up being one of the
19:05
main POV characters later in the series but Lazo Lea she encounters lea for the first time in shadow demons book 4 they
19:12
have a contentious relationship due to Lea's relationship with Jackson so if I
19:17
wanted to and what I would actually do is I would always when I mention a book
19:22
go in to the edit button like you saw me do just now highlight the title of the
19:28
book and then click Add link and when I do that what you're gonna see is it's gonna say insert link and I could browse
19:35
my pages and files to figure out where I wanted to insert that link but it's
19:40
super easy because you can see that I already have a page called shadow demons
19:46
book 4 on the sample wiki it also gives you a chance or an opportunity to create
19:51
a new page so if this was the first I had mentioned a character or an item or a place I could create a new page
19:58
right here from this place or what I'm gonna do since I already have a page called shadow demons book for is I'm
20:05
just gonna click on that and now that linked this set of text here to that
20:11
page so when I go to click Save now all I have to do if I'm reading through this
20:17
and I see oh she just encountered her for the first time in this book I click on the name of the book and it brings me
20:23
back to the shadow demons page showing you another example of that when you're
20:30
setting this up and how it becomes so magical when you're doing your research so I can go to edit page here and
20:37
remember how I was talking about crow village or peach ville our places so I
20:42
can click on peach ville go to add link and I can see that I've got a few
20:49
options here peach Ville Georgia on the sample wiki now I told you I had created this as a
20:55
sample wiki just for this video so that is where I'm actually going to direct
21:00
this piece of text however one of the other cool things about using a wiki like PBworks is that if you have the
21:07
series that are interconnected like I do for example my shadow demon saga is connected to my sacrifice me series they
21:15
share a world they share many characters so if I already had a wiki done on
21:23
sacrificed me and this character or this place already had a page over on that wiki then I could choose that down here
21:30
and the two different wiki's could talk to each other so if that's confusing at all let me show you the example so
21:37
obviously I already have the shadow demon saga wiki like I told you this is the one where there's all those spoilers
21:43
and all that stuff I can't show you however because it's picking up over
21:49
here on this sample separate wiki I could link to the page for peach or high
21:54
school on my main wiki or peach ville the town on my Mayton what that would do is I wouldn't have to
22:00
recreate that page so let's say you are writing your main series this shadow demon saga
22:06
then you have your wiki all set up then you decide to write a spin-off series you don't have to set up new pages for
22:13
all of those characters or those rules or those items or those locations that
22:18
you're reusing in the new series all you have to do is even though you're on a new wiki you can link back to the old
22:26
pages so it kind of allows you to have this great interconnectivity between your different wiki's but for now since
22:32
this is still the sample wiki I'm just gonna do the sample wiki so I don't show you any spoiler pages so then once that
22:39
saved you'll see that this is now again a hyperlinked thing that's gonna bring you to my peach Ville Georgia page and
22:47
you'll see over here in the navigator that I've put that in a folder called places so again very basic information
22:54
here a fictional small town in the middle of the state several hours south of Atlanta Harper is brought here from
23:00
her latest foster home at the beginning of beautiful demons and again this would be another situation where I could edit
23:05
this page and link to my beautiful demons page to show which book that was she has moved into shadow fir'd home for
23:13
troubled girls so again this would be another opportunity to make a page in places for a shadow for home so that I
23:20
could actually like include a picture of what I thought this house looked like I could include like who lives there and
23:27
who runs the place and all that sort of information on the outskirts of peach Ville Georgia where she is told this is
23:34
her last chance to behave and avoid being sent to juvenile detention so like I said hopefully you can start to see
23:40
how powerful this can become in terms of once you create pages for all the people
23:45
places items magic system rules and all
23:51
that sort of thing in your world then you can connect each page and each time you mention that on inside of a page to
23:58
the next page and it just makes it super super easy to navigate so when I click
24:04
up here on files you can see the basic folders that I already have set up so I have a folder for each of the books and
24:10
then inside that I would have obviously a page for each of the books as well as images and things like that for the
24:17
books I obviously have only done book four for this presentation but you could put
24:23
every and you would likely put every single book including if you wanted to side stories or spin-off books that
24:31
would link to a separate wiki I also have a folder here for characters so every single character that I create or
24:37
come across in my story world would have their own page so Jackson hunt also has his own page and I have his hair color
24:46
his eye color any other descriptions like he has a signature I have smile and his relationships other things that I
24:52
would add on the character page are significant things about their since I
24:57
write a paranormal world what types of magic they use and how they grow throughout the series so that I'm gonna
25:03
be continually building on that and changing their page as I write each new book so if someone gets scarred or
25:11
someone gets you know something changes about their appearance or the way they learn to use magic that would go on
25:18
their page and all of that stuff would be very easy to see on the page so I
25:23
would create a new page for every single character items of note are things like the ribbon that I talked about an on
25:30
harper's arm places so you've got peach Belle Georgia The Crow Village would be
25:35
another one the shadow world itself which is my fantasy world that comes in starting at the very end of book four
25:41
would be another place there are castles so you could put I could separate like
25:47
towns or countries and you can actually nest folders inside of them so I could
25:53
put places and then I could create a subfolder that had the names of like
25:58
buildings or structures if I wanted to go that specific with it and then I also have one for like the order of shadows
26:04
which is the main organization in my world so you can create any kind of
26:11
folder that you want and then have sub pages inside that folder and like I said you could also create sub folders that
26:18
each had their own pages so it gives you a lot of structural opportunities to do things like that so I'm gonna go back to
26:24
characters and go back to Harper Brighton so remember I said in part of
26:30
her description is she's to wear ribbon around her wrist so I could click on the word ribbon and it's
26:35
gonna take me to the items of note folder where I have a page called ribbon and here I linked back to her name again
26:42
Harper Madison is often known to wear a ribbon around her wrist in book one beautiful demon so there's
26:48
another opportunity that in my main wiki I would be linking that back to the main book page which would have a summary and
26:54
everything else she explains to Agnes that and here I have an actual excerpt from the book one of my foster moms
27:01
works at a craft store she always used to bring home tons of leftover ribbons I said feeling lame I don't know I just
27:07
like to wear them for color so that way I've given myself to refresh my own memory later as to why she's wearing
27:14
these ribbons and why it's important but then I continue on she begins to wear ribbons and demons blue at this point
27:20
ribbons become increasingly significant in shadow demons which of course links
27:25
back to the page for book 4 and rival demons which I would link to the page for book 5 as Harper is taken prisoner
27:32
by the order of shadows and again that's another opportunity to link this to my
27:38
page for the order of shadows obviously I remember right now who the order of shadows is because they're a big part of
27:46
my series but you might end up with a big series world where you're like oh I can't remember who the order of shadows
27:52
is how does that organization work you know that sort of thing so it just gives you a chance to really interlink
27:58
everything while in captivity she is bound by shackles that rub her wrists raw when she is taken to be executed
28:04
she's forced to wear a white dress that later becomes bloodied and dirty when she is freed and taken to the shadow
28:09
world which I would also link she rips a strip of bloody cloth from the hem of the white dress and wraps it around her
28:16
wrist like a ribbon so here I have another excerpt then and there I vowed to wear it until I either died or won it
28:22
would serve as a constant reminder of my new purpose my new destiny I will never forget which is an excerpt from rival
28:28
demons chapter called never forget so I would also link that so in my main wiki
28:34
you would basically see pages just full of connected links to other pages and it
28:40
does take time to set all of this up but if you're writing a 10 12 15 books
28:45
Erie's you're gonna need something like this no let me show you the other major part of having this sort of
28:53
interconnected wiki and why I love using a wiki is this right here in the top
28:58
corner you've got a search function so if I was back here and I was on let's say my front main page of my series and
29:05
I was just coming in to my wiki because I wanted to find out some information about prima daemons so I search for
29:11
prima daemon because I'm trying to find rules for a prima daemon and of course there's gonna be a lot of stuff here
29:17
that has some spoiler type stuff can't be avoided because it's pulling in from my main shadow demon saga wiki but I do
29:24
see here that in the sample wiki I mentioned prima daemons on this page and it highlights anything there so now I
29:32
can see that okay here's where I said Prima demon and now I've got references
29:37
to the prima demon so not only can you go to files and search through these
29:43
pages and you can you know have connections between pages like clicking
29:50
on peach ville which takes you to that and it just enter links in that way you can also go to the search function and
29:57
you can say you know the order of shadows and it will show you if you if
30:03
you go here it will show you the actual folder that's titled that but you can also just click enter and it's going to
30:09
bring up every instance that you've mentioned the order of shadows so you can see here that if I click on it it's
30:16
gonna bring me to the folder where I have a cup you know page listed in it but once this is heavily populated this
30:23
search function becomes extremely important because let's say you know I'm
30:29
working on book 11 right now and I need my assistant to find out how many moons
30:35
are in the shadow world and I just can't seem to remember from my own you know
30:41
writing of it because it's something I haven't mentioned maybe since book three or four so what I can do and this is
30:46
another thing that's cool about PBworks and I'm not sure if it's specifically like part of every wiki but I can go
30:54
into tasks and I could create a task like I could click new task and create tasks for my assistant to research that
31:01
so when she logged in like I could say to her hey can you go into the wiki and
31:06
you know complete those tasks that I have for you so I could have a bunch of research tasks here for her and I could
31:13
say research the earlier books to see what I said about shadow demons moons I know Jackson's the one who mentions it
31:19
while they're on a date and so what she could do is she could come up to the search function and she could say she
31:28
confirmed news and then she could look anywhere in the main series and see if
31:37
there was any mention in the wiki about moons so you can see it brings up first
31:44
of all the tasks that I've given her then it also brings up a mention of it
31:51
from rival demons inside my main wiki and it also mentions something about the moons from my willow Harbor series so
31:58
it's going to pull up every single mention of the moons from all of your wikis so what's so great about this is
32:04
that if you're working on like multiple series that are based in the same world and you've created wiki's here even if
32:10
they're separate wiki's anytime you mention a word a person any specific set
32:17
of text it can pull a search from all of your different wiki's and show you
32:23
exactly where that reference is and then if you knew it was rival demons chapter
32:29
9 for example that you see something about two moons and what color they are you could actually go back to the actual
32:35
book and search through chapter 9 this saves so much time versus like having to
32:41
actually like open up every single book file and search inside of it for anywhere you might have mentioned moons
32:47
or someone's last name or you know anything like that it just the search function here saves you of course it's
32:54
only going to save you if you actually have taken the time to put these this
33:00
information in these pages in so what I like to do is I obviously didn't I
33:06
actually didn't start this until I was starting to write
33:11
7a and so on so if this got started way late in my series which I would highly recommend that you get started on a
33:18
series wiki right when you're starting a book but we did that with willow Harbor or we started it right when we started
33:24
the very first book and every single time a book was finished we would take
33:29
you know a couple hours and go in and create pages for all of our characters maps of the places add pages for any of
33:37
the places or the magic systems or any of the rules that became fact in the world because the book was now finished
33:43
and that way anyone else that was doing research on that particular series could
33:49
easily find what they needed like in just the click of a button or a simple search up here and it wouldn't take
33:56
going back through three or four books searching for the information it saves
34:01
so much time and it makes everything so much more organized and like I mentioned before some other functionality you have
34:09
here like let's say I know that I'm going back to Harper's page all of the time because she's the main character of
34:16
the story I could just click this star button and now she becomes a starred page so when I go back out to files or
34:24
actually to my front page and I've got this Navigator over here there's an option to just choose the starred pages
34:29
and files so I could say okay these are the two starred pages and so it just makes things a little bit faster for
34:36
navigation if you only have a few of those but in terms of functionality you can add and change these pages in so
34:43
many different ways you can add images like for example if I was going to Harper's page I didn't do this for
34:49
copyright reasons to show it in a video but like chloë grace moretz is someone
34:54
that I think about as like if someone were to currently play Harper in a movie it might be her she would be a good
35:00
example of someone I could see playing Harper in a movie so I would put a couple sample pictures of Chloe grace
35:06
Moretz here and of course I haven't done that because I couldn't like I didn't want to get in trouble a copyright
35:11
infringement but if it's your own personal wiki and you're not sharing with anyone you're not going to get any kind of trouble for that but you can put
35:19
so you could put celebrity character files in here
35:24
character images you could put book cover images you could put you know any other kind of inspirational images for a
35:30
place so for example if you are going to you know your page that has the places
35:38
here and I wanted to give an example of what peach Ville Georgia looks like then I could go into like ad here and I could
35:46
add a file and I could put a picture of what I think peach Ville looks like if I wanted to put like a picture of what the
35:52
library looks like you can always add those pictures you can add descriptions you can add actual excerpts from the
35:59
books and that sort of thing and it just becomes really really powerful so like I
36:04
said what some of the main things that I love about this are the ability to enter link between pages where you can just
36:11
add a touch of a click you can find the page that you need and constantly be linking back out to the pages and the
36:17
other thing is the power of the search engine so if I wanted to put in like shadows birds like I knew that shadow
36:23
furred was the home for girls that she goes to I can put in shot of her it in the search and it's going to search all
36:29
of my wiki's for stuff about shadow fern and I'm gonna quickly navigate away from that because there you go with all the
36:35
spoilers but as long as you take the time to create pages for every place every magic rule every organization
36:43
every character every book that you've written and put a main summary in there you're going to have opportunities to
36:49
search this very thoroughly instead of having to go back and search through your books and that's part of the reason
36:56
that I absolutely love using a wiki for my series Bible so I sincerely hope that
37:01
you guys have enjoyed this inside and look at how to create a series Bible using a wiki for me this has been an
37:07
amazing tool it's collaborative it's easy to search it's easy to cross post and it's easy to access it from anywhere
37:14
whereas if I had used just like a word document or something like that I would have had to put it up in the cloud and
37:20
then you know might not have been able to access it on my Chromebook etc and if you've watched my video on Google Docs
37:25
you know that I'm a big liked proponent of being able to use like webpages or different types of things that are in
37:32
the cloud and have that functionality so that no matter what computer you're on no matter what house you're in what
37:38
state your in what country you're in as long as you have your password you can always access that information it's just
37:43
super important to me personally so having a wiki which is an online web page and having everything stored in
37:49
there has been super useful to me however not everybody wants to set up a wiki and you maybe want to do a little
37:55
bit more with like color coding or different things like that so what you might want to check out is
38:01
something like one note or Evernote I know that some people have created very
38:06
intense color-coded series Bibles in OneNote and I do believe so you guys can
38:11
let me know in the comments but I do believe that as long as you have a password you can also access one note or
38:17
onedrive which is a Microsoft product from any computer but I'm not 100% certain about that because I haven't
38:23
used it Evernote is also something that is an app so you should be able to access that as well from like any
38:29
computer it may even have its own web page so if you're interested in something like Evernote or OneNote and
38:34
want to check those out I don't have a specific example since I haven't used them but you might be able to check out
38:40
YouTube here and see if someone else has those examples or search the web and see if there are other blogs that have them
38:45
as examples because I know I've seen them out there in terms of other writers using OneNote or everdrive or onedrive
38:51
so those are just another couple of things that you can use I've also seen a
38:57
ton of writers recommending that you print out pages and you use that as your
39:02
series Bible and even though I am an alternate ultimate planner girl and I love to have everything on paper and I
39:08
love my binders and everything else this is one place where I would highly recommend that especially if you have a
39:14
series that's more than just a trilogy or whatever that you definitely keep something digital because you cannot
39:20
open up a binder and search it you have to physically turn pages and it's just
39:26
going to take you twice as much time plus I find that with binders you end up with sticky notes here and everything
39:31
didn't get you can't certainly can't cross post if I mentioned Jackson on a Hopper's page I can't just click a link
39:38
and suddenly it takes me to Jackson's page I have to actually search for it and maybe get tab dividers and different
39:43
things and it just takes more time that might be perfectly fine if you're writing a very simple series or you only
39:49
have a handful of characters or it's only one or two or three books but when you start getting into a bigger series we've got
39:55
six ten twenty books and you've got lots of characters like you're writing a romance series so every single book has
40:01
two main point of view characters you really need something digital so I highly recommend this wiki system or
40:08
something like one note or Evernote or something like that hopefully this video has given you a good idea of some things
40:15
some ways that you can put together your own series Bible I'd love to hear your comments below on what you thought of this system and whether you'd like to
40:21
start trying it I have down below giving you example of the one that I use which is just PBworks comm this is just
40:27
something that businesses typically use it's not made for authors so there may
40:33
be another tool out there that's more specific to creating a book series so if you have any suggestions on other wiki's
40:39
that are free or easy to use for authors feel free to link those down below as well and hopefully you guys have enjoyed
40:46
this and it's been informative for you if you have enjoyed this I would love for you to subscribe to my channel if

bye [Music]

summer has arrived which for many of us means a temporary shift in what we would
0:06
call our normal schedule so I thought it would be the perfect time to talk a
0:11
little bit about how do we continue to go after our goals and maintain momentum
0:16
when we have a temporary shift in our schedule so whether it's like me you
0:22
have kids home for the summer or you're a teacher and you have more time over the summer or it's not even summer at
0:28
all and it's just a period in your life where you're gonna need a different schedule than what you would call your
0:33
normal schedule let's talk about that today
The Big Picture
0:41
many of you know if you've been around for a while that I love to plan in quarters so that's like January February
0:46
March is q1 and so on Q3 is coming up soon starting in July but my schedule
0:53
has already shifted here in the month of June so sometimes that quarterly plan of
0:59
being a set three months doesn't always correspond with exactly the way life needs to be but that doesn't mean that
1:06
you can't still go after your goals and be intentional with your time so here's
1:12
some tips on and actually a process on how to maintain that momentum and be
1:17
intentional with your time even if your schedule doesn't quite line up with a quarter or you've got a temporary shift
1:24
that might not come around again so first things first I always love to get
1:30
an eagle eye view that big picture view which usually for me means getting out a
1:36
calendar usually it's printable I love paper but you can do this digitally and I how or Google Calendar as well but
1:43
basically having a calendar available so that you can really get an eagle eye view of how much time am I actually
1:50
working with so I'm going to give you some examples so I'll show you how I print this out from Google Calendar or
1:56
how you can use it online but I also have a special free download for you today if you are actually planning out
2:03
these next few months June July and August and it's going to help those of you that are wanting a schedule for your
2:09
summer hopefully to make that great plan for yourself so if you go to calendar.google.com you will have a
Google Calendar
2:15
Google Calendar here even if you don't typically use Google Calendar it will still be there for you to use if you do
2:21
use Google Calendar what I do for this is I take off all of the events because for example I'm part of the heart
2:28
breathing writing Community right so on my regular Google Calendar it's got all the live streams and Sprints now unless
2:34
you want that on your calendar which some of it isn't even going to print correctly because there's just going to be so many events I personally just come
2:41
over here to all these calendars and just unclick everything so I have a blank calendar and that's one way that
2:46
you can get a printable of a blank calendar anytime you want so all you do is uncheck all the calendars that you
2:53
don't want showing and then you come to this little Cog up here in the right and you click it and you click print and
2:59
it's going to ask you the print range so May 28th to July 1st is just going to be really the month of June so I would come
3:05
out here and I would say all the way to the end of August or you can customize this according to whatever your plans
3:11
are so if it's just a Christmas break and it's December or it's just a small winter break or spring break or anything
3:18
you can just include the month that you want to include and then you just click print and once you do that it's going to
3:24
print out a blank calendar that's all on one page that you can use or I'm also
3:30
going to show you the printable that I have for you that you can use next up we're going to take a look at our monthly calendar and this is where most
Monthly Plan
3:37
people tend to go wrong with their goals they think they have three full months
3:42
for summer but when they actually put it on the calendar they realize they only have about four weeks to work and when
3:48
we put three months of work on our calendar or on our plate for our goals and we try to accomplish that in only
3:54
four weeks we're obviously going to come up short because we're not super human so part of the key of this is just
4:01
getting an idea now everything that you put on this calendar doesn't have to be set in stone we're not seeking
4:07
Perfection here we're just trying to make sure that we have a really good idea of how much time we actually have
4:14
and not how much time we wish we had or how much time we just ethereally think will manifest because sometimes when we
4:22
actually put pen to paper we start to realize oh my gosh we've got this vacation and we've got gymnastics and
4:27
swim lessons and all these other things now I know I'm talking about kids specific stuff but this can apply for any time in your life you've got
4:33
meetings you've got Vacations or extra special things going on so first step is
4:38
you can use that Google Calendar which comes out looking something like this and all is on one page per month or you
4:44
can use the download that I have for you if you want to head to the resource Library if you're already on my newsletter list or you can grab it today
4:52
by signing up for my newsletter and I've got that link for you in the description so just below the title of this video
4:58
you'll see a button that says read more or show more click that and you'll see all the links below
5:04
there's a Sunday start and a Monday start so use whichever one and basically just make your way through the calendar
5:10
you can use color code I like to use Crayola super tips or the Sharpie s pins
5:15
S Note pins and basically just figure out what is already on your calendar you
5:22
can look at a Google Drive you can do this in Google Sheets or notion or iCal
5:28
but some of us we see things so much more clearly when we actually write it
5:33
down so just use your own personality and preference it doesn't have to be done the way I do it but I'm marking
5:39
down things like when's the last day of school this is not my actual schedule just for privacy reasons but let's say
5:44
Evie has gymnastics every Thursday I would put that on a schedule because it's something that I'm already committed to double down day I've got
5:51
the virtual running Retreat set up in July maybe we're going on vacation when does school actually start back and just
5:57
mark on your calendar in a color code if you prefer you can make notes over in this other section what do you already
6:03
have planned for the summer and that's going to give you this bird's eye view of how much time you actually have that
6:10
feels like a normal uneventful work day and how much disruption you actually
6:15
have to your schedule now that you have that eagle eye view it's time to really think about the time that you have left
Your Wishlist
6:23
in your summer or whatever this break is for you and start thinking of all the
6:28
things you wish you could accomplish during this time now we're not setting anything in stone yet we're just making
6:34
a wish list so for me I'm going to talk about summer but just know throughout this video anytime I talk about summer
6:39
break you can easily apply this to winter break or to fall break or to any
6:45
other shift in your schedule be it one week or several months between jobs
6:50
whatever it may be it all applies no matter your situation but I'm dealing with Summer right now and so I'm
6:57
thinking about multiple things I'm thinking about how I can be intentional
7:02
with my family and make the most of the summertime before my sweet little Evie goes to school for the first time in the
7:09
fall and she won't be home with me all day and it feels like the end of an era in my life as a mom so I want to just
7:16
soak it all up having both my kids home this summer and just make the most of this time with them so how can I be
7:21
intentional and plan fun things for them but also maintain momentum in my own
7:26
career I am almost finished with one of my books and then I'm moving on to book 12 again and there's momentum that I
7:33
don't want to lose so that's the balance that I'm trying to seek so what I'm going to do next is I'm going to make a
7:40
wish list of all the things that I want to do with the kids this summer all the things I want to do with my own goals
7:46
this summer and then I'm also going to think about other projects that I might want to tackle during the summer so let
7:51
me show you an example of my wish list and how you can fill it out in your workbook next step is our summer wish
Wishlist Workbook Sheets
7:57
list so this is where you're really going to start to think of all the things you would love to do this summer
8:02
now I've given you two sheets if you've taken hb90 or had the planner before you will recognize these as our project
8:08
planner sheets just repurposed as a summer wish list I am going to fill out two sheets for myself you don't have to
8:14
do it this way but one of them is going to be for my family and home projects
8:19
and the other is going to be for my like writing and career stuff so I find it
8:25
helpful to kind of have those two things separate now you've got a check mark here for when you have decided yes I'm
8:33
going to do that usually in the second column we would put our estimated task blocks but I don't have the time to
8:39
really explain and go through task blocks here it's basically just Pomodoro calendar blocking but what I have
8:45
intention of leaving this blank so you can use it however you want but the way I'm going to use it is I'm going to use
8:50
this as what date did I decide to do this and so what I'm going to do is I
8:56
would sit down and I would make a list of what's all the family and home projects I really would love to get done
9:01
this summer because remember I'm trying to be intentional with my kids as well as getting my work done so this might be
9:08
things like oh I want to take a trip to the zoo I wanted to do family walks I
9:13
wanted to do family art time I would just make a list just brainstorm all the things that I wish we could all do
9:18
together as a family and any other projects that I might want to do in my home such as cleaning out a closet or
9:25
anything that feels like spring cleaning summer cleaning cleaning out the garage any of that kind of stuff
9:31
then on my career and writing side I might put stuff like you know finishing
9:36
The Disappearance of Vanessa Shaw and Publishing it and that might be my
9:42
two biggest goals for the summer but you might have a whole full list you might need to print this out twice but the
9:49
next step is really just to get all of this stuff down so that you have an idea of what you want to do over the course
9:56
of the summer another piece to this now we're going to deal with this ideal daily plan in just
10:02
a moment but another piece to this with this other sheet which again is repurposed from the HP 90 planner and I
10:09
think will be very helpful for a lot of you is once you have all of these things that you know you want to do go in and
10:16
transfer them to whether these are things you'd like to do every day during the summer things you'd like to do
10:21
throughout the week like once a week things you want to do once a month every summer or during the season of your life
10:27
things that are just going to be one time Adventures or one-time vacations and then other which might be things
10:32
that like you don't necessarily know when you want to do them or how often you want to do them but they're just ideas that you had so for example the
10:39
zoo trip might just be a one-time event the family walk though I want to do that
10:45
weekly and I'd really like to ideally do it twice a week so I'm going to write Family Walk times too
10:51
art time is something I want to do every single day with the kids as as much as
10:56
possible obviously I'm going to put it on daily but if we're on vacation we might not do art time we probably won't but it's like on our normal days art
11:03
time cleaning the closet however is really something I don't want to do every month every week it's kind of a
11:10
one-time thing but it's not going to be just one day so I might put clean the closet under under other because I don't
11:16
know how long that's going to take and it won't take a whole day or whatever also finishing The Disappearance of
11:21
Vanessa Shaw I might put that under other but I also might just put daily and put writing and then put The
11:28
Disappearance of Vanessa Shaw over here so that I know I want to be writing every day so once you have your wish
11:33
list filled out figure out how often and when you want to do that and we're going to take this information and we'll use
11:38
it a little bit later in the process here's where mindset really matters because in our planning we often create
Mindset
11:46
a wish list or we create a goals list like here's all the projects I'm going to get done but so often this is where
11:53
the plan starts to go awry because we often approach our planning sessions
11:59
with rose-colored glasses we see ourselves as having tons of energy always Wide Awake always available like
12:07
no health problems everything's going great and we plan for ideal scenarios
12:12
like if my Best Day Ever Was a thousand words a day I'm gonna plan to write a thousand words every day this summer but
12:19
hopefully you can see that when you actually go to implement that plan you're not going to feel good every day
12:24
some days you're going to have headaches or there's going to be distractions or someone's going to need something from you that you weren't expecting or your
12:30
kids are going to get sick or the weather won't necessarily comply or the words aren't flowing and it's just not
12:36
going to be a thousand so one of the biggest things that I talk about on hb90 but also just I wish I could get through
12:43
is that when you fail to follow through with your plan it is not actually a
12:48
personal failure it is not your our fault that the plan was too difficult to
12:55
follow because it is just the way we're sort of taught to plan it's the vibe we usually come to with planning is that we
13:01
are the perfect version of ourselves with full health full energy and we're just a paper doll going through our
13:07
plans with Rose Colored Glasses everything's great but then when we actually show up to the plan
13:14
we find out that maybe we don't actually have as much energy as we thought like maybe you planned things back to back
13:20
with no breaks and that's just not going to be possible for you or maybe you didn't take into account your chronic
13:25
illness that puts you out three days a week because we don't want those things to be true but what happens is that we
13:34
create this plan that basically is setting ourselves up for disappointment and then when we don't follow through we
13:40
blame ourselves which spirals us into what I call negative momentum where we
13:46
say there it is again proof that I can't follow through with my plan proof that I'm never good enough you know whatever
13:51
it may be for you that sort of running commentary in your mind whereas if you
13:56
could create a plan taking your reality into consideration and understanding that hey
14:03
I actually don't have as much time as I thought or I actually wanted to like if I thought I could write a thousand words a day I'm gonna plan for 500 and
14:10
anything beyond 500 is gravy then we would set ourselves up for greater success and every tiny Daily Success
14:18
builds positive momentum which makes you want to have even more success tomorrow and we can spiral upward in our
14:25
productivity in our joy in our excitement for our plans because we're starting to see results whereas when we
14:31
plan to be perfect and we don't follow through with it we spiral downwards like it's another day and then you don't feel
14:37
motivated to work tomorrow because you're not seeing the results you want and so if I could really encourage you it would be to on this next part of the
14:44
process that we're going to move into don't expect yourself to put every single thing that you just put on your
14:49
wish list into your actual plan and whatever you feel like is your best case
14:55
scenario knock that down to about 75 or less so that you're setting yourself up
15:01
for Success now I know this won't work for everybody because some of you are really type A personalities and you need
15:06
stretch goals to meet your goals so plan in whatever way feels intuitive to you but if you're showing up to this video
15:13
thinking yes this resonates with me I always set big plans and I always fail or I never follow through I mean I know
15:20
we hate that word failure but sometimes we say it in our own minds I set up these great plans I never follow through
15:26
with them and then I feel like crap if that is you then I encourage you just for this summer plan or for this
15:33
temporary plan to take a few things off your plate knock your goals down to half of what you think you they should be give
15:39
yourself more buffer more free time and see what happens the next stage of the process after your wish list and getting
Weekly Plan
15:46
your mindset in the right place that you're not going to be able to do all of it is to actually create your plan so
15:54
this is also going to look very different for each of us depending on your preferences your strengths the way
16:00
you like to do a schedule but I'm going to show you how I do it and then I'm also going to give you some Alternatives
16:05
if this way doesn't work for you so let's take a look this step is where we
16:11
kind of diverge based on what your personal preferences are because I want to be respectful of the fact that some
16:19
people love as much structure as much time awareness as possible and for other people too much time awareness too much
16:26
structure paralyzes you or you rebel against it so from this point forward for sure and really in all of my videos
16:33
or courses I want I want you to be thinking about how you best operate like what is helpful for you is it better to
16:40
have like an exact schedule I'm going to work from this time to this time I'm going to write every day at 9am and
16:46
having a routine or are you more likely to get your work done if you say I would like to write 5 000 words this week and
16:53
it doesn't really matter when it happens it's just a matter of okay I've looked at my schedule and it looks doable or
17:00
possible that I can do 5000 words and it doesn't matter if it's Monday or Friday or you know when it happens and feel
17:06
free to just go with that so what we're going to do next really is we're going to look at the big picture
17:13
of your summer and then we're going to combine that with this daily monthly
17:20
weekly and we're going to create this ideal sort of daily or weekly plan and any piece of this can just be thrown out
17:27
and I'm going to try to give you some alternatives for what might work for you and what might not so the simplest
17:33
version of this for those of you that don't want to fill out like the idea of filling out a schedule of exactly this
17:39
time gives you hives or you know you won't follow through with it the simplest version at this point would
17:44
just be to look at overall everything you have on your calendar add in any of
17:51
these extra things now that you want to go ahead and schedule and then take a look week by week and
17:58
say okay this week is really light I'm going to try to commit to 10 000 words this week this week like 10 000 words
18:05
this week super busy I'm gonna write only a thousand words and you can just give yourself a plan based on what seems
18:11
reasonable and you are done with your plan and you can happily go about your summer
18:16
for those of you that feel like if you put 10 000 words on here you don't and you don't have a plan of when you're
18:22
going to follow through with it and you need more structure that's we're going to move into next so if you don't want
18:28
to do this part just skip I've put chapters down below and you can just skip to the next part of this video but
18:33
otherwise hang in there because this is really similar to what we do with hb90
18:40
and again not every way of doing things is going to work for everyone so it's important to just really lean into your
18:46
own personal strengths and preferences I'm going to go back to my actual calendar
18:52
I want to keep these pages in order a little bit I'm going to go back to my actual calendar and I'm going to see if
18:57
any of these things can actually be scheduled in so for me I don't actually want to go in and add art time every
19:03
single day to this calendar because that would be kind of a waste of time but some of these things like going to the zoo I might want to say you know what
19:10
this would be I don't want to go on a weekend because it'll be too busy but maybe for Andrew's birthday we can go to the zoo and I can put that in here on
19:17
the schedule and then I can come over here to this and I can check it off and say okay that is taken care of I could
19:24
also underline it or highlight it in green or whatever I wanted to do and I could slowly check things off that I'm
19:30
ready to schedule some of these other things however are going to be stuff we do more often and we don't need to add
19:36
them to the calendar but where they will come into play is with our ideal daily
19:42
calendar or our ideal weekly schedule so that's this sheet here
19:47
okay once you have everything added to your calendar I want you to you know if this
19:54
resonates with you I want you to start working on your ideal weekly or daily plan and I'm going to probably try to
20:01
change this to say weekly instead of daily but I think you understand what I mean there's a Sunday start version or a Monday start version included depending
20:08
on which one you care to use and this is where we're going to basically calendar block and this is where you can use your
20:15
color codes here so you've got different colors like for me it's heart breathing's admin social media writing
20:22
family routine like Sarah's routine Health routine and you can be as detailed as you want
20:30
to be or you can kind of back off just a little bit and in fact if you really want to take everything into consideration you might want to add
20:36
things to this list like groceries laundry planning time Church like
20:41
anything it is that you do on a daily or weekly basis that you're responsible for in your household that you want to
20:47
account for in your time you might want to add to that list and so basically I would keep this list of daily things up
20:54
somewhere I could see it when I started to work on this other calendar and one
20:59
thing to remember is you want to try to step through your day in a realistic way so if we're trying to
21:07
make space for our writing when the kids also are going to be home and you're trying to make sure that they stay
21:13
entertained where are your most likely pockets of Time For You especially if you're a mom who doesn't have or dad who
21:20
doesn't have somebody home who can help so I have George so I can plan my riding time around George but for some of you
21:27
you're home alone all day with the kids right and so you might want to think about your writing time getting up a
21:32
little bit earlier in the morning working a little bit later at night that's what I always used to do when Andrew was little and I was home alone
21:38
because George had a job sometimes temporary schedule shift is also going
21:43
to mean a temporary sacrifice of me time just make sure you're taking care of your mental health and your physical
21:49
health and you're not burning yourself out but sometimes there is a sacrifice of that personal time so that you can
21:55
have that quiet time in the morning before the kids get up or it could be a matter of the kids understand that
22:01
they're going to get screens or they're going to get you're going to set them down with something they can do and there's a boundary that like every day
22:07
I'm writing from nine to ten and you're not allowed to bug me but really think about that when you're creating your
22:13
ideal schedule so for me it's going to be kind of blocking things out so I
22:18
would be thinking like what time do I want to be up in the morning and what does my morning routine look like okay I'm going to go till 8 30 and I'm going
22:24
to start to block this out and I'm going to write this in as my morning routine and then I'm going to think about like what time is lunch and start sketching
22:31
out not only the way that my schedule is going to be because of meals or other things but also taking into
22:37
consideration things like uh gymnastics groceries the planning for
22:42
the week the Family Walk The Art time all the things that I'm trying to make room for in my schedule where do they
22:48
fit so I might be like okay we're going to do lunch from this time to this time and art from here and we're going to go
22:53
to gymnastics on this day and I've got coffee chat on this day and start just mapping out your schedule and making
22:59
sure that you're building in breaks and buffer time so I did this basic schedule
23:05
for myself just so you can see an example this is not exactly my true schedule but it is an example
23:11
and you can see that I've built in a little bit of buffer here and there because I want to make sure that I'm not
23:17
going back to back to back so that if this runs over I'm missing this other time but I have tried to make a lot of
23:23
time for family that's all the screen and a little bit less time for my work and so I'm understanding that over the
23:29
summer I'm not going to have as much time to work because I'm making my family a priority so we can't do all the
23:35
things all the time sometimes it's got to be okay what's my priority for this season in my life so I've got my morning
23:41
routine a little bit admin prep time that probably won't take 30 minutes so I've got that as a little bit of a
23:46
buffer as well I've got solid blocks of writing time on the mornings of some of
23:52
these weeks some afternoons where I'm planning to go to Panera and then I also have a couple of evenings where instead
23:58
of playing games or hanging out with the family I'm gonna go right once Evie is in bed and so I've got my writing time
24:04
scheduled out I also have the family time I have my meetings sectioned out I have social media time heart breathing
24:11
time and I've made sure that I've got time on the schedule with breaks in between so here's an example of what it
24:17
might look like since I'm specifically thinking about how much writing I can get done over the summer I have also
24:22
written out how many task blocks per day am I spending on my writing and how much does that give me for the week because I
24:30
want to spend all this time with the kids but I really want to finish this book and get it published so I need to make space for that in my schedule and
24:37
yes that's going to be a little bit of a sacrifice here on Tuesday and Thursday nights but it's also going to be fun so
24:43
you don't have to do this much writing but if you're wondering what a task block is it's just a 30 minute increment
24:49
so one two three four five six so that's basically three full hours or six task
24:55
blocks and that's what I've written down here that's not my total work test blocks like we do in HP 90 but it's just my
25:01
writing ones so 36 task blocks a week or a little shy of 20 hours 18 hours of
25:07
work on my writing throughout the week so hopefully this will give you some ideas just sketch out how many of these
25:15
things you can schedule how many of these things you can put on here and understand that not everything on this sheet is going to get onto your schedule
25:22
and that's okay then if you want to take this a little further and get even deeper into well how much can I actually
25:29
write within that time I'm going to show you another little formula that you can use to help you figure that out and part
25:36
of that is going to involve actually going back to your calendar so let me
25:41
get these sheets arranged again so one of the things that I love to do when it comes to this is how many days
25:48
out of your schedule so far are you actually going to be following this ideal plan how many days are you
25:54
actually going to get this writing in so I would take this ideal plan and compare it to my schedule and say okay on the
26:02
5th on Monday am I going to be able to get my writing done now obviously that day has passed as I'm recording this but
26:07
I would make check marks for all the days that I can follow this exact plan in the way that I hope and I would just
26:14
continue this day I won't so I could put an X there or just leave it blank this entire week with hb90 I'm going to be
26:20
spending more time with my students so I won't be able to do as much writing that week we're going to be on vacation this
26:26
week I won't be able to do as much writing so I'm going to go through my entire schedule and I'm going to see how
26:32
many days and put a little check box if it's a writing day I'm actually going to be working on my stories and in fact
26:38
none of these Sundays would work because I don't actually have writing on my schedule on Sundays so I would go
26:44
through and checkbox all the days that I think I'm going to be writing according to my normal schedule and then I will
26:50
add them up and that's going to give us the beginnings of this formula that I'm about to show you so here's your writing
Your Writing Plan
26:56
plan it's this sheet right here I also have a little quote here best summer ever if you want to use that if you are using this during summer but this is how
27:03
we bring it all together to figure out what your writing goal is going to be for yourself for the summer and how
27:08
you're going to maintain your momentum throughout the summer so here's a simple formula you might follow I have blank
27:13
days available to work on my writing goals this summer and then let's say I came up with 29 days available I would
27:20
write it in here I have 29 days available from my calendars to work on my writing goals this summer I plan to
27:27
write how many words per available day so let's say I set a goal of I'm going
27:32
to write a thousand words a day when I'm available to write that's my goal that's my ideal but we're going to keep a
27:38
flexible mindset we're going to do something that feels achievable don't put a thousand words down if you like almost never write a thousand more art
27:44
in a day even if you have extra time try to be as realistic as possible or another way you can do it if you
27:51
don't want to go by words is I plan to work at least this many minutes or this many hours on my available days so you
27:58
could say Okay 29 days I'm gonna work at least 90 minutes or I'm going to work at least two hours and you could just
28:05
underline which one you're using minutes or hours then you're going to take these two numbers and plug them into one of
28:10
these two formulas so you would say 29 days goes on both of them or however many days you had times if you use the
28:17
words per day you use this top one if you use time use this bottom one so I'm going to use the words let's say 29 days
28:23
at a thousand words a day gives me easy math 29 000 words as my goal for the
28:30
summer some of you it might be simple like this that you just say okay I'm gonna work
28:36
you know I'm just gonna use super simple math and I'll say 100 minutes so that I can just say 2 900 minutes per
28:44
summer for some of you it's going to be this simple and now you have your goal of how long you're going to work or how
28:50
many words you're going to write throughout the summer but some of you might be doing editing like I am so you might want to cite chapters like I'll do
28:56
29 days with one chapter per day and so that gives me 29 chapters or it gets me to the end of the book so you might need
29:03
to tweak this a little bit depending on what part of the project you also might be working on multiple projects this summer so use this however serves you
29:11
the key to remember here is that there are no rules there's no expectation that you need to be perfect
29:17
you just need to have that big picture view of how much time you realistically have and then make a decision about what
29:22
feels achievable and accomplishable within that time because 29 days available is very different from
29:28
thinking you have a full 90 days because you think you've got three months right so this is the key here is how much time
29:34
do you have then here you can kind of make a promise to yourself this summer I'll be working on so I would put The
29:40
Disappearance of Vanessa Shaw but you've got time or room here if you're working on multiple projects I would love to get
29:45
the following done during this time so I would say I would love to get edits done and Publishing tasks
29:52
then my main priority for the summer is two and this is just a question or a
29:58
statement that brings you back to is your main priority going to be writing some of you are teachers or
30:04
students or you you don't have kids but you have a little bit of extra time during the season of your life so maybe
30:10
your main priority is to get as much writing done as possible and that is okay and valid but for me my main
30:16
priority for this summer is to spend time with my kids
30:22
and so I'm going to write that down and even though I have this goal of finishing The Disappearance of Vanessa
30:29
Shaw this moment right here where I realized to have adventures and memories make memories with my kids is my main
30:35
priority that if this doesn't get done at least I didn't slip on the things that mattered the most to me
30:41
so that is how I am planning my summer or my temporary break and I will of
30:47
course weave this ideal schedule and what I want to get accomplished into my Q3 plan so if this style of planning or
30:55
my type of teaching has really resonated with you come join us in the hb90 boot camp it's 90 day planning So the plan
31:02
will begin at the first of July however you can use everything you've done in this temporary schedule and I will teach
31:09
you how to use it in the 90-day plan a major part of setting goals and actually
31:14
achieving them during any time of the year is being aware of how much time you have and being intentional on how you
31:21
spend it so I hope this has given you some good tips Go download that free workbook for the summer or come join us
31:27
in the hb90 boot camp I also have planners on Etsy there's a digital planner and a printable planner if you
31:33
want to get started that way a lot cheaper just to check out the system I also have an entire playlist here on
31:39
YouTube called my kanban board which which will teach you a little bit about how this hb90 system works so I hope you

thank you [Music]
hello everyone and welcome back to heart breathings i'm so excited to talk about today's topic so
0:05
this is video number two in our how to write a series series and today we're going to be
0:12
discussing the differences between character arcs story arcs and series arcs so this is a really fun
0:21
topic for me this is something i could probably geek out over and talk about for ever so
0:26
i'm really excited about today's topic so let's just dive straight in
0:32
[Music] if you are new to this channel or you're
0:37
new to this particular series of videos this is an eight-part series on how to write a
0:43
series and we're going to be discussing a lot of different aspects of a series including how to write a series bible
0:48
how to plan your series how do you know how many books should be in a series we're going to cover a lot of ground here so i hope that
0:55
you'll subscribe and make sure that you like this video as well as hitting that notification bell so that you'll get notified
1:01
whenever a new video comes up from me i hope to be posting these videos every single thursday so definitely come
1:08
back and check out for the next video so our first video in this series was
1:13
about basically an overview of some of the pros and cons of writing a series and then we talked about
1:19
the different types of series that exist so if you missed that video head back to watch it i will link it for
1:25
you down below as well as in the playlist here for how to write a series and let's dive into today's
1:31
topic actually before we get started i already know that there's going to be some of you asking about this t-shirt
1:37
and where i got it so i got this from a shop called a planned design and i will link that for you down below
1:44
i also got a couple of paper clips one that had my name on it that you might have seen in my dream planner setup recently so go check out
1:51
her shop she has this got washi shirt and a few other shirts like it in several different colors so i just got this in the mail
1:57
yesterday and i'm in love with it so go check that out okay so diving into today's topic so
2:03
difference between a character arc and a story arc as well as a series arc now next week
2:10
we're going to get deeper into how do you plan these different things and how much of it do you really need to know before you start writing a series
2:16
so hold on to those great questions because they're probably going to get answered in the next couple of videos
2:21
but let's just discuss the basics of these three different things because each one of these has its own structure
2:28
to it and it's so important to understand the difference between the three when you start writing your series okay
2:35
so when we're talking about story arc versus character arc it's
2:40
really pretty simple to understand the difference a character arc is your character's internal
2:46
transformation or growth your story arc is the external this is the flow of events in a story whereas
2:54
the character arc is internal the story arc is external but they do usually flow in a similar
3:01
manner and they're interconnected with each other so we'll talk about this a little bit more coming up let's go over the details
3:08
though of what is a character arc a character arc is the transformation or inner journey
3:15
of a character over the course of a story basically this is the transformation or
3:22
the internal personal change that your protagonist goes through throughout the story if you have
3:29
multiple pov then you will have multiple character arcs and
3:34
how much that character transforms is often going to be decided by the type of series that
3:40
you're writing which is why we discussed this in the very first video but also the genre that you're writing
3:46
so you can't say that every character goes through a major personal transformation because like i
3:52
said it does depend on those things but let's talk a little bit about what genres you'll commonly see
3:59
different types of character arc and what structure that character arc usually takes so the most common type of character arc
4:07
that you're going to see is a positive character arc meaning that your character starts out one way that is sort of broken or
4:14
they have a lie they believe about themselves that they need to overcome and see the truth and by the end of the story they have
4:21
overcome this and now they are a better person in some way so think about like
4:26
scrooge in a christmas carol he hates christmas he's got all these past things that have happened to him
4:32
that make him hate christmas and he has a you know ice around his heart then he goes through this entire
4:37
transformation where he has to face his past and by the end he is a completely
4:42
transformed character that is a character arc and it plays hand in hand and happens alongside the
4:49
actual story arc which we'll talk about in a moment usually you're gonna see a positive
4:54
character arc but sometimes you will have a character who starts out one way and is maybe broken or flawed or
5:01
believes some kind of lie about themselves but over the course of the story either the tragedy that they faced was just too
5:08
much for them or something happened to them that turned them to the dark side hello anakin skywalker
5:16
but every once in a while you will see that negative character arc where your character goes darker or
5:23
becomes evil or becomes the villain of a future story or something like that so sometimes you'll see negative character
5:30
arcs and sometimes you'll see positive character arcs but by and large we're going to be looking at positive
5:36
character arcs in general the character arc that you see most commonly is that your character has
5:44
some kind of wound or ghost in their past something tragic or upsetting that has
5:50
affected them and has made them believe something to be true about themselves
5:56
that is really a lie so for example you've got harper in my shadow demon
6:01
saga who has been passed around from foster home to foster home her adoptive father was killed in an accident that she caused
6:09
she's had all this trauma and tragedy in her life and she is confused about her own powers
6:15
that she sees so when the story opens she's got this wound of her past of being passed around and nobody wants her
6:22
so that wound has led her to believe a lie about herself and that lie
6:27
is basically what determines the way that she shows herself to other people
6:33
the way that she acts the way she believes about her life it influences every decision and every
6:38
interaction that she has and her particular lie is i'm broken
6:44
and i'm unlovable and i'll never find love she desperately wants to be loved and accepted
6:49
but she really believes that she's not worthy of that because of her past and this is a pretty common
6:55
character wound and starting place so that's where the star story begins is that she has this wound
7:02
and she has a lie now that she tells herself which is that she's not lovable and
7:07
because of that lie she presents a false self to the world and her false self
7:13
is like a way that she's trying to protect herself like an armor she puts on that is saying i don't care about you i
7:19
don't need anybody to survive right then as she progresses through the story
7:25
her character arc is that she begins to understand by the end of that story that she is in fact
7:31
special and that she's starting to see a glimpse of the fact that there might be a place where she
7:38
fits in in this world and she's starting to imagine what life could be like if this lie was no longer true which
7:45
means she's starting to get an idea of her true self so let's talk about this
7:51
type of structure where you go from a wound in the past that leads to a false lie or belief
7:58
about your character believes about themselves then transformation throughout that
8:03
story that leads them to glimpse the truth of who they are which
8:08
is usually the opposite of the lie they've been telling themselves that is usually the arc that a character
8:15
will go through now sometimes it won't necessarily be a huge wound in the past like if we've been
8:20
watching some of the marvel movies lately so you've got thor so thor doesn't necessarily have a huge wound in his past
8:27
he has a wound that occurs there inside the book or inside the movie itself but at the
8:33
beginning if you look at his character arc he is someone who is extremely arrogant and prideful and believes that
8:40
his way is the best way and he you know he just like let's kill them all if they don't do what we say
8:45
we'll kill them all and because of his pride his father the all-father sends him down to earth where his powers
8:52
are completely stripped from him and that experience of the story itself
8:57
the story arc influences his character arc to where he finally realizes that it's not just all
9:03
about me that i actually have to protect people i have to become worthy of
9:08
this hammer and so you see this character arc where he's not just thinking about himself he's not just
9:13
arrogant he understands his own weaknesses and he is willing to sacrifice himself for others you see
9:19
a similar type of character arc if you look at iron man and tony stark when you first start out he doesn't
9:26
neces i mean he does actually have a wound with his father and that presents his false self that
9:31
like hey i'm just a party guy you know whatever and then he has this experience of being
9:37
captured and people want to use his weapons in a certain way that transforms him so that
9:42
by the end of that first iron man movie he is not he's not a completely unbroken
9:47
person he hasn't fully faced the demons of who his father was but he is now no longer the
9:53
self-centered party boy that he was in the beginning so this is typically the structure you're gonna see
9:59
wound or something that happens in the story that creates a wound a false self that your character
10:04
portrays because of a lie they believe in themselves then this character arc transformation where at the end of the
10:11
story they have started to show their true self which is usually a better self
10:16
than they were at the beginning of the story and this is common story structure stuff but
10:22
it plays out differently depending on the type of series that you're writing when we're looking at a dynamic series the type of series
10:30
that builds each story builds on the last one you're going to have a major
10:35
transformation like your character will be someone totally different at the end of the story than they were at the
10:41
beginning of the story but that character arc needs to go over the course of the entire
10:47
series so each book similar to what we're about to talk about in terms of story arc
10:53
each book will have a small transformation for your character but they won't have
10:58
their entire transformation completed until the end of the story so just to
11:03
pull another example from a movie that you might have seen so let's talk about the matrix trilogy
11:09
when you have the beginning of the story you've got neo who believes that the world is as it is and he does see that there are
11:16
some other things going on he thinks he's kind of on to some kind of mystery or some kind of thing that
11:21
other people can't see but he doesn't understand what the matrix is and he certainly doesn't think he's
11:27
anything special he's just kind of like a low-level like hacker basically and over the
11:34
course of that first movie he does have a significant transformation his eyes are opened to the way the world
11:40
really is he finally starts to fight he's finally starting to get his skills out from
11:46
under him which he has to go through not only that story arc for him changes and his skills change
11:51
but he has to embrace something within himself but at the end of that first movie neo still does not believe he is
11:57
the one he makes an even bigger transformation in the second movie
12:03
but he's still not fully grown as a character he's still not able to fully defeat the big bad and
12:09
change the world and save everyone because he's not quite internally strong enough so you can see the transformation he
12:16
makes in the first movie is pretty significant but it's not enough then his transformation in the second
12:22
movie again is huge but it's still not enough and it isn't until
12:28
that final book and his ultimate sacrifice that we see finally this incredible
12:34
character transformation if you want to watch a trilogy where you see a major
12:39
character transformation in a dynamic series i highly recommend the matrix because what neo goes through and how he awakens
12:46
to not only his own power and skill but to who he needs to be in order to defeat
12:53
the machines is beautifully done so with the dynamic series and we'll talk about
12:59
this some as we get into planning your series next week you're going to have that character structure of an arc in every single book
13:06
but there will also be an overarching character arc for your for your main characters if
13:12
you're writing a dynamic series that just has a single protagonist then that one protagonist will make a
13:17
little bit of headway and then a little bit more and then a little bit more and a little bit more and the same way the storyline progresses
13:23
throughout multiple books their character arc will also progress one of the biggest pet peeves that many
13:29
readers have including myself is when your character who is the main character goes through something that is
13:35
transformative in the first book like harper realizing that she is a little bit special if you see her
13:41
overcome that and believe that she's special and lovable in the first book you can't start the second book with her
13:47
no longer believing she's lovable one of the main problems that i see people make with character arcs is that
13:53
once their character has transformed they can't go back to who they used to be there may still be that like
14:00
lingering moment of man am i really good enough am i really worthy but because of their past experiences
14:06
and their past transformation they should always come back to this place of i am and i know i am because
14:12
i've been through these things but if you were to watch a character like harper or like nia who
14:18
doesn't believe he's good enough and then in the second movie he still doesn't believe he's good enough but he comes and he transforms and now he can
14:24
fight really good and then he goes to the third movie and now he's back to where he was and he just can't fight anymore because he's
14:30
you know back to not believing in himself your readers are going to give up on that character and they're not going to like that character anymore so
14:37
as you're writing a dynamic series you need to keep in mind that your character needs to grow
14:43
each book in a pretty transformative way and once they have transformed past a
14:48
certain lie they believed about themselves and they have come to become their true self you can't go back so they need to be now
14:55
facing another demon so to speak some other inner demon some other belief about themselves
15:01
so we'll talk about this more in next week's video on planning but you need to think about how long
15:07
your series is going to be what is your big bad and how each book can move your character a little bit
15:13
further toward that ultimate transformation without taking backwards steps at least
15:19
not too often so let's talk briefly though about standalone series with a standalone series it depends on
15:25
genre and what type of standalone series if you're writing romances let's say it's
15:31
standalone romances that are interconnected so it's a small town romance all of them
15:36
are set in the same town but each book is self-contained that means the character arc
15:41
also needs to be complete and self-contained in each book so that means your hero
15:46
and your heroine should have a complete character arc in each book and in fact your character
15:52
will start with that wound or that lie they told themselves and then they will go through a bunch of things usually their own they
16:00
will have their own wound to face or their own lie to face and they will not actually be able to fully fall in love
16:07
and have a complete climax and resolution for
16:12
each other where they have a happily ever after until they have overcome that lie they tell themselves
16:18
so that means you've got the story arc where your characters are going through things together and they're falling in
16:23
love and that's the flow of the plot but internally in romance your characters have to also
16:29
face that wound or that lie they've told themselves in order to open their hearts enough to
16:35
fall in love and of course there are of darker types of romances where there is not such a huge transformation
16:42
especially uh and if you're looking at like some erotic romance you're not going to see such a huge
16:47
transformation but then you do have romance series where your characters go through a very large transformation
16:53
but the key is that there needs to be some kind of transformation for them to fall in love at the end
16:58
if you're writing a traditional romance now if you're writing a romance series where it's the same couple like 50
17:04
shades of grey then you'll do it like a dynamic series where it's a little bit of transformation and
17:09
a little bit more until the final transformation where they have a happily ever after so
17:15
you've got to think about what type of series you're writing because that is going to influence not only your story
17:20
arc but also your character arc when you have a standalone or episodic mystery series
17:26
where you have a sleuth or a detective that you're following often sometimes you will not see a huge
17:33
character arc or transformation and in fact some standalone type series like james bond
17:38
you almost have no character arc at all so this is another example where you need to know what type of series you're
17:45
writing what type of character you're writing sometimes like with jack reacher or with eve dallas you're going to see
17:52
a little bit of character arc and growth in each book but it won't always be this massive
17:57
transformation that you might see in a dynamic series because you know there's going to be 50 books with this character and the real
18:04
focus is that story arc where you're looking at the who done it or the mystery and then on top of that
18:10
you have a little bit of character arc but it's really story driven instead of character driven
18:15
so just the key to remember with all of this is make sure that you know what type of
18:20
story you're writing and then tailor your character arc or transformation or growth
18:26
to that type of story so that's the character arc is the internal shift the story arc is basically the
18:34
unfolding of the plot so when you're plotting your novel you have these plot points that you hit
18:41
right so you're like okay here's the argument against transformation and the first doorway and you know all these things so you've got
18:47
those plot points but the story arc is really the way that all of that unfolds it's
18:53
the flow of the story and most stories follow a similar type of story arc
18:59
there are five classic elements to a traditional story arc so you have exposition which is the who
19:05
what when where why how so this is like where your story begins the setting who it's about what your
19:11
character is going through what their life looks like right now so you've got that exposition at the beginning then you have some kind of rising action
19:19
and then this is where we're talking about like the inciting incident the store the like trials and
19:25
tribulations that your character goes through this is the majority of the story is the rising action part
19:30
then you will have a climax so you'll have a moment where the tension is at its greatest and it seems
19:38
like your character is never going to get out of it that is the climax of your story where it all comes to a head
19:43
then you have falling action which is after the climax this is kind of the end
19:48
of the story and then finally you have the resolution so a story arc is basically contains all
19:54
of those plot points that you'll have in a story or in a plot but it usually goes like this exposition
20:00
rising action climax falling action and then you're done and of course we all know
20:06
that the rising action itself tends to also kind of go up and down in terms of the flow of the story when i was doing
20:13
some reading up on this video and some research i also discovered this is something i knew but i didn't
20:19
have exact terminology for that they're actually considered certain archetypes so this is
20:24
something we didn't talk about with character arcs but now that i'm getting here we probably should have so
20:29
there are often archetypes when it comes to characters if you would really like to read more
20:35
about archetypes especially when it comes to romance novels check out the book heroes and heroines
20:40
because it goes through the different archetypal characters you will find in fiction like the spunky kid or
20:47
jaded hero you know or whatever it is so there are archetypes that are pretty common that
20:53
you'll see some of your characters go through so if you're interested in that i will link some of the reading that you can do for
20:59
different character archetypes but what i didn't realize is that there are actually archetypes for story arcs
21:06
as well and i i knew it but i guess i just had never put that together in the exact way so i'm gonna tell you what these are so
21:13
you've got comedies and tragedies obviously we know this from studying shakespeare in school
21:18
you have some there's a certain structure and archetype to a comedy story then there's a certain type of structure
21:25
to a tragedy you also have the quest you have overcome the monster rags to riches
21:33
story a voyage in return and a rebirth story i think most of my fiction
21:41
falls into the overcome the monster like defeat the big bad type of story but it's really
21:47
interesting to think about your story in terms of archetypes so if you want to do some more reading about this
21:52
you can check out christopher booker's 2004 book called the seven basic plot points so
21:59
i will link that for you down below this is a book i have not read myself and i'm actually looking forward to picking it
22:04
up because i love to read craft books so i'm excited to hear what he has to say about these different story archetypes another book that you
22:11
might want to read if you want to read about different story archetypes is blake snyder's save the cat because he
22:17
talks about how there are only certain kinds or only a specific number of types of stories and he has a
22:25
lot of good examples in that book as well so i will link all of that stuff for you down below but similar to the
22:30
way that character arc flows where you have you know where your character is in the beginning the things
22:36
they go through and like i've talked about before if you go and watch my series on how to plot a
22:42
novel i talk more about the mirror moment but this is something you may want to check out from james scott bell
22:48
as well that he talks about your character in the middle or midpoint of a book will usually have a
22:55
mirror moment where it's as if they're looking in a mirror and saying what have i become and that what have i become moment is
23:02
often a transformational moment for your character where they say oh my gosh this lie is not really true
23:08
so this is kind of a combination of books and i am going to have an entire resource list
23:13
for you in the workbook that you'll be able to download next week but i've also included some links for you down below because this reading it's
23:20
almost too much to go into in a short video here but there is so much more to
23:25
those character arcs than meets the eye so there's a lot more reading for you to do there also
23:32
the story arc and the character arc will go hand in hand so like i said that exposition that you
23:38
have in a story arc that is often where we learn about the character's wound maybe but we learn who this character is
23:45
what they believe about themselves and what that false self is that they're portraying to other people we also learn the setting and where they
23:51
live and what's happening in their world then as the story arc has rising action
23:57
that's where we really get into the nitty-gritty of what this character is going to go through so you have an inciting incident that pulls them into
24:03
the story you have that character constantly being challenged and growing not only externally through the plot but
24:10
internally they're facing their own demons or their own lie about themselves when you hit the midpoint of a story you
24:17
often hit what james scott bell calls the mirror moment where your character looks in the mirror
24:24
at themselves figuratively and says oh my gosh what have i become so they're starting to understand that
24:30
this lie they believed about themselves is not actually true and that in order to defeat this story
24:37
or in order to fall in love or in order to complete their character arc really to
24:42
complete their journey and to go where they want to go they have to transform at the midpoint
24:48
they're usually not ready to transform yet but there's going to be a plot point there that forces them to look in the mirror
24:55
so the story arc and the character arc really go hand in hand with some of these plot points mirroring
25:01
what's going on internally with your character then by the end of the story you're going to
25:06
have that climax and in that climactic moment is when your character truly has their transformation and they
25:13
finally are able to embrace whatever's deep inside of them or they're finally able to see that what
25:19
they believed all this time was a lie and that they need to embrace embrace the truth of who they are
25:26
and then once they do that they're able to defeat the monster get the girl you know fall in love
25:32
whatever your type of story is but it's true across many genres that you're going to have that
25:37
transformational moment that goes hand in hand with the black moment and the climax of the story
25:43
then you have the falling action which is kind of the wrap up and you know where things are and
25:50
then that final resolution so in that final resolution is where you see your character in their new
25:57
world how they are now as opposed to who they used to be so that is basically a thorough explanation of story arc versus
26:04
character arc and of course some of the books that i would highly recommend to you will be a complete resource list
26:11
that i'll have for you in your series workbook that you'll be able to download next thursday but i will also link some of
26:18
these books down below if you're ready to get a start on them because there is so much more involved here in character
26:23
arc and story arc than i could possibly explain to you in short videos but hopefully this gives you a good idea
26:29
of it now what's the difference then between a story arc or a character arc
26:34
and a series art so a series arc is an overarching story arc that takes
26:41
place over multiple books so again what type of series arc you're going to
26:46
have and how big it is can often depend on the type of genre that you're writing every
26:51
book that you write needs to have a story arc it has that exposition rising action
26:57
climax falling action and resolution every story that you write should have that type of
27:02
story arc but not every series needs a series arc so if you're writing a standalone
27:09
type of series you don't necessarily have to have some kind of over arching storyline it can just be
27:15
that each book stands alone and that's fine sometimes sometimes with an episodic
27:21
series each book stands alone but you do have an overarching storyline so for example in
27:27
my fair hope series those are standalone romances and you could pick them up at any point in the
27:32
series and enjoy a complete story arc and the two character arcs for the hero
27:38
and heroine however there is also a series story arc with my character from the very first
27:44
book has been through a trauma and there's a trial that happens
27:50
and you don't find out the result of that trial until book four and then her full transformation of how
27:57
that trial affects her and her friends until the final book so in that case you just have a light series arc
28:04
and it's just something that happens in the background but it's not the main idea of your series however
28:09
if you have a dynamic series each individual book will have its own story
28:15
arc but there will also usually be a very large series arc that ties
28:20
all of those books together in a really tight interlocking way so i saw a blog post where
28:26
the author compared a series arc to an umbrella with these little archways
28:33
and i thought this was pretty brilliant so i created my own graphic like this but i will have linked in the
28:38
description that original blog post where i saw this analogy so that you guys can check it out for yourselves
28:44
so a series arc is an overarching story arc that extends over multiple books in a series so this is
28:50
the top of the umbrella it still has a similar shape to a regular story arc because it
28:56
is a story arc but you don't get it all in one book it unfolds over
29:02
multiple books so each book will have its own story arc and
29:08
somewhere in that story arc it will lead into the main series arc so it'll present
29:14
clues questions challenges relating to the series arc that happens
29:20
in each book and it gradually will bring us closer and closer to the climax and resolution
29:25
of the main series arc so in book one you're going to have a complete story arc you'll have
29:30
the exposition the rising action the climax the falling action and some type of resolution
29:37
but you will also have some type of clue or question or your character will go
29:42
through something that leads into a greater story arc something that isn't answered
29:48
all in book one that leaves story questions left to be answered or it leaves some kind of overarching
29:54
villain so it might be a mini boss that gets defeated or it might be something that gets defeated and you
29:59
find out at the very end that hey this is actually a much bigger organization that we're fighting than we thought
30:05
and it can vary as much as the type of genre that you're writing but each book
30:10
adds to the story arc itself now in this example i only have four books here because that's the size of the umbrella
30:17
but of course a series arc can extend over only two books it could extend over 20 books it's also worth noting that if
30:25
your series includes a character transformation arc each book is going to have its own
30:31
character arc that similarly to the story arc builds until the transformation of that
30:36
character is great enough for them to finally defeat the main story problem or
30:42
whatever the main question is or the overall series arc so in this way your series arc
30:49
includes elements of your individual books story arcs and your individual books
30:56
character arcs so it's all three of these things are going to play with each other very very closely so you
31:02
can hopefully see now how important it is to start thinking about your series plan
31:08
which again we'll have a video on this next week so make sure you're subscribed and you hit that notification bell so
31:13
that you'll come back for the next video in this series so think about the harry potter series
31:20
for example each book has its own sort of standalone mystery or event you've got the
31:25
sorcerer's stone and what's going on with that you've got the basilisk and everything that happens there
31:31
you've got the cup the tri-wizarding cup you've got each book having its own sort of
31:37
self-contained mystery but it's extremely closely tied in and woven in with the series arc of
31:46
the evil voldemort and his followers and who is going to defeat him and that overarching series arc
31:53
influences every single book so it really depends on the type of genre
31:58
but it's going to take you as the author and creator deciding how strong your series arc is and how much
32:06
of a part it plays in each one of these books i would say that with most like fantasy and things like that
32:12
the series arc has to do with who's the main villain of the story and each individual book may fight like
32:19
a mini boss or have its own self-contained mystery but something in that story or something
32:25
in each book will further that main series arc that leads you to the big bad or the big villain of the
32:33
story sometimes you know who that villain is at the very beginning like you did with baltimore sometimes you just know that there's
32:40
something funny going on but you don't learn about that villain and it's like little pieces of that mystery
32:46
come together like a puzzle throughout the series so that series tie-in can be kind of like a subplot that's a
32:52
small undercurrent of your series until later it becomes like the big main event or it can be
32:58
something that influences every single book in the series very strongly another thing to note is that
33:03
you can have multiple series arcs throughout the course of a series
33:08
so i do this with my shadow demon saga the first six books is basically one series arc where each book leads to
33:16
the next in uncovering this basically one big bad but at the end of book six it sort of
33:23
unlocks an even bigger series arc where you understand that this big bad
33:28
was just the beginning and now there's another big you know group or a person that they
33:34
have to defeat so then the next six books of that series are about defeating not only each
33:39
individual mini boss so to speak but also a larger entire series arc of the high priestess
33:48
and so you can see that sometimes with bigger series it's often with episodic
33:54
series that you'll have a subplot that becomes like a main event and there will be an umbrella that says
34:00
okay these six books belong to one series arc but then the next six books are a different series arc or it'll be
34:06
kind of like this trilogy has the same big bad but at the end of book three they're defeated and then book four sort of introduces a
34:13
new one so you can have multiple series arcs throughout the entire series i think that so much about your
34:20
character arc your story arc and then your series arc really does depend on the type of
34:25
genre that you're writing and the type of story you want to write how much each book really builds upon
34:32
the next or if they completely stand alone because like i said you could end up with standalone
34:37
romances that really don't have an overarching series arc they're just interconnected books but
34:42
they don't have one main storyline that flows throughout the entire series so it's really up to you you
34:50
don't have to have a series arc especially in that type of romance or even mystery
34:55
but it's just another way to further tie your books together if you'd like them to be more
35:00
interconnected okay so i hope that this explanation of character arcs versus story arc versus
35:07
this overarching series arc was helpful for you if you have any questions please be sure to pop them
35:13
in the comments down below or send me an email at sarah heartbreathings.com i am going to have another video for you
35:20
next week video number three that is all about how to plan your series with this video i will have
35:27
for you a free series planner workbook that will help you to make some of these decisions to
35:33
determine what type of genre you're writing how strong your character arc is going to be and even map out your series arc and the
35:40
individual books in that series but we're also going to have a discussion about
35:45
how much of that do you need to have planned before you get started how much do you need to know before you
35:50
can write the first book how much do you need to have written before you can publish the first book
35:56
we're going to talk about a lot of that stuff and for that reason it might be split into a two-part video
36:01
so be prepared for maybe planning your series part one and part two that will come
36:07
one week after the next so i'm excited to keep diving into the idea of series
36:12
writing for you and i hope that this clarified things for you a little bit so just to recap a character arc is the
36:19
internal journey that your character goes through and it plays hand in hand with your
36:24
story arc and the story arc is the unfolding of the plot it's the beginning that rising action the
36:32
climax and then the falling action it's the flow of your story every book needs to have a story arc
36:39
most books will also have a character arc that is self-contained but also
36:44
potentially grows throughout the course of a series some series will also have a
36:51
series arc which is basically just one overarching story arc that still
36:57
rises in action and will have a climax towards the end of your series or at least the end of that particular series
37:03
arc not every series needs to have a series arc but it can be a strong way to tie
37:08
your books even more closely together and that's all i have for you if you have any questions or you have any other
37:15
great resources besides the ones that i link for you down below feel free to add those so that you can help add to the
37:21
community and make sure that you are subscribed to this channel turn on your notifications so that you'll be notified when
37:27
new videos come up from me and i will see you guys in our next video on how to
37:32
plan your series bye
37:55
you

hey guys welcome back to heart breathing's and our how to plot your novel series this is video number seven
0:06
bringing it all together so I have a
0:13
little bit of a confession to make I already recorded this video and it was like seriously 45 something minutes long
0:19
of me just talking and I realized I was kind of talking in circles so much so
0:24
I'm rear according it and hopefully I'm going to make this a little bit more concise for you but the reason that it
0:29
was so difficult for me is that really this part of the process you know once you've got the basic
0:35
framework of your story the foundation of your story figured out how you go from that foundation to really filling
0:43
out and fleshing out this story is a very personal process and I think that you are just going to have to through
0:50
trial and error figure out the process that works better for you for a lot of people if they know that first scene and
0:56
they know where act one is they can pants the mess out of the rest of Act one they don't really need to know every
1:03
detail of the scenes that are going to follow they just need to know okay I've got this basic idea and they can run
1:09
with it like just filling out that plotting sheet and having that basic structure where you know the beats and
1:14
you know where you're gonna end up at the end of Act one might be enough for you so you might want to try just going
1:20
from there and seeing what happens and seeing if you can come up with a really great story but for those of you who are
1:26
a little bit more like me and you need to kind of have a little bit more idea of how one scene leads to the next then
1:33
you might want to take time to do the rest of this that I'm going to show you today cuz this is my personal process
1:40
just remember as with all of these things there is no one way there is no right way and there is no wrong way
1:46
other than simply not writing your story the only thing you can do wrong is to not try new things and try to get better
1:53
as you continue to hone your process everyone is going to have their own personal way of doing things and really
1:59
what may work for you with one book might not work for you with another so continue to try new things and of course
2:05
in the next video we're going to be talking about what happens if you get stuck so stay tuned for that last video
2:10
but today let's talk about how you from the basic framework which if you
2:15
think about like we're building a house here if you think of your novel as a house what we should have once you've filled out act 1 all the way through act
2:22
3 you've got your character arc internal and external motivation goal goal motivation and conflict and now you've
2:29
got the basic framework of your story you know where it begins you know what allies your character is
2:34
going to have you know that first doorway of no-return the midpoint there mirror moment you know that second
2:40
doorway you know the final battle and the climax and even if you are a hundred percent certain on it you've at least
2:46
got some ideas now of what's going to hit each one of those beats that we've got in the plotting notebook so you've
2:52
already started thinking about these things which means that in terms of your house you have the foundation laid and
2:58
you hopefully already have the framing of your house you can see the skeletal structure of it but what we need to do
3:05
now is we need to start filling in all of those gaps we need to put up walls and drywall and we need to start
3:10
decorating the house and really making it look good so here's what I do basically what I know usually at this
3:16
point is of course I know my characters goal motivation and conflict both internal and external and that guides
3:22
pretty much how my characters going to act and react throughout the story it also guides my decisions on what
3:29
challenges to put in their way because I want to craft a story that is specifically going to challenge this
3:35
particular character in all of the things that they struggle with so when you have that synergy between a
3:42
character that needs to grow in a certain way and a story that forces them to grow in that way you end up with a
3:48
much stronger storyline than if you don't have a strong character arc so be thinking of ways that you know your
3:55
character is going to be challenged throughout the story and what is going to force them ultimately to change in
4:00
the way that they need to change in order to be fulfilled where I start at this point when I have that whole sheet
4:06
filled out I've got my characters filled out and all of the plotting stuff filled out is I start to think about my scenes
4:12
now a scene is basically just the building block of your story this is the action of your story and how you define
4:19
a scene is really going to vary depending on what resource you look at but basically a scene
4:24
is a moment of action where something is happening to your character right now and it's not something that we summarize
4:32
it's not something that we gloss over it's actually something that's happening that the reader can almost experience
4:38
themselves as if it were happening onstage in a theater and in a scene the
4:43
basic building blocks of a scene as one of my favorite books on writing scenes is seen in structure by Jack Bickham and
4:51
also if we go back to km while in structuring your novel she gives a really good explanation of scenes and
4:57
sequels in the back of her book towards the end so definitely check out those two resources Jack Bickham basically
5:04
says that the main things that you have in a scene is you have a character with a goal and that goal can be something
5:11
big or it can be something small but you don't want it to be so mundane that the reader doesn't care but you don't want
5:17
it to be so huge in every single scene that it feels like we're bordering on ridiculous because everything gets to be
5:24
so huge you want to find that balance between the perfect goal the perfect level of conflict and the perfect level
5:30
of twist for where you are in your story and of course one of the best ways to figure that out for yourself is to watch
5:37
lots of movies read lots of books in your chosen genre and try to figure out kind of what the expectations are and
5:44
most stories you have an escalation of conflict and as things get more and more desperate or more and more intense
5:50
throughout your story and as the stakes begin to rise those goals in each scene become more and more important and it
5:56
begins to grow as the story grows the most important factor to keep in mind and this comes from K my lens but I
6:02
totally agree with this and you'll hear a lot of different plotting gurus talk about this the most important thing to
6:08
keep in mind when you're planning each of these scenes is does this scene and its goal relate to the overall plot are
6:16
we moving the character forward in this overall plot in the overall story
6:21
question or not and if the answer is no then that scene simply doesn't belong in your book so you should only choose
6:27
scenes that move your character forward in the plot or relate in some way to the actual plot of this book now when we
6:34
talk about the basic structure of scenes what we're talking about is your character has a goal and this
6:40
goal can be something really big and it can be completely stated like I'm gonna
6:45
go here and I'm gonna do this or it can be something that is just more implied like we know that when this character is
6:53
coming home her goal is to make sure that her parents don't know the truth about what happened in Boston whatever
7:00
the goal is it can be something that's actually stated or it can be something just that the reader understands that
7:07
this is what the character wants and that can be enough to be their goal then what you have is you have some level of
7:12
conflict that develops throughout the scene something that stands in the way of your character achieving their goal
7:18
or getting the result that they wanted and then as the scene wraps up you're going to have what Jack Bickham calls a
7:25
disaster now I know a lot of people hear that and they think okay that means I've got to have like something huge happen
7:32
but it doesn't necessarily mean that like every scene needs to end with a death stakes or every scene needs to end
7:38
with some kind of like murderous thing like somebody gets shot or somebody ends up in a car accident doesn't have to be
7:44
quite that big to be labeled a disaster it just has to be something that happens in a way that your character didn't
7:50
expect and puts them in a place where now they're worse off than they were before so if your character for example
7:57
was coming specifically to talk to their mother to ask for $10,000 that was their
8:04
goal the conflict might begin to develop that as they're about to ask their mother for this money their sister comes
8:10
in and also is crying about something that happened to her and she's asking for money instead which interrupts your
8:16
character and now she feels like she can't ask for money because the other sister has now gotten it and that
8:22
becomes the disaster because she can't even ask for this money and things did
8:27
not work out exactly the way she wanted so that's just a simple example that just popped into my head right now but
8:32
you could probably watch movies or read other books and see lots of examples where your character goes into a scene
8:39
into some sort of moment of action where they've got something that they want whether they admit it or not whether
8:45
they explicitly state it or not there's something they're going to achieve or something they want to get out of this
8:51
moment then something comes in that is in conflict with their goal and at the end
8:56
something happens that makes things a little bit worse than when they start it
9:02
the reason behind this now of course they're going to be exceptions to this and they're going to be lots of different ways that you play around with
9:08
that basic structure but it's just a good thing to keep in mind as you begin to develop your own scenes it's like how
9:14
does this move the plot forward how is this logical growth from what happened
9:21
in the previous scene and how does this lead my character to the next scene so let's talk about that for just a moment
9:26
because another essential part of writing is the sequel and this is
9:32
another term that comes from Jack Bickham and I like to think of it more instead of sequel a scene and sequel I
9:38
think of it as just action and reaction when your character goes through this scene or this moment where they
9:43
experience something and there's some sort of conflict and now they're worse off than they were before they're going
9:49
to have some sort of reaction and this is what he calls a sequel where there's a moment of emotional reaction to what
9:55
just happened oh my gosh I can't believe my sister is taking this $10,000 that I needed and she's gonna have some sort of
10:02
emotional reaction to that like maybe there'll be tears maybe there'll be a temper tantrum who knows then she's
10:09
going to think through why she feels the way she feels which begins to give us depth of this character starts to play
10:16
into your characters motivation and if you can weave that in with your characters internal struggle all the
10:21
better and then your character's going to after some period of reflection make a new goal okay fine I'm not going to
10:28
get this $10,000 for my mom so instead I'm gonna go get a job and I'm gonna try to earn this money a different way now
10:34
what makes that great is that decision to go get a job is now going to lead your character a little bit closer to
10:41
what happens at the end of act 1 which might be that this job leads to them meeting the man of their dreams so
10:47
hopefully you can see just in that brief example how you've got a scene which has some kind of conflict and produces a
10:54
problem for your character the sequel is that they go through some sort of emotional reaction they process what
11:01
just happened and then they make a new decision they decide to do something else or they create a new goal for themselves that's a
11:07
short-term goal and then in the next scene presumably they're going to start
11:12
going after that goal so the next scene for that you know imaginary character I just made up might be that she actually
11:18
begins to look through the paper and start going and applying for jobs so what is going to happen throughout your
11:25
story at this point is you're going to have a series of scenes and reactions to those scenes and your character is going
11:31
to set goals short-term goals for themselves that they keep running into conflict with which deletes them to
11:38
their next goal or their next set of action and each one of those scene and sequel segments or sections is going to
11:45
lead your character further into the plot until they hit that doorway of no return or that mirror moment and as your
11:52
story continues to develop each one of those scenes and reactions should have something to do with the overall story
11:59
question and the overall plot of your book so what I like to do if we start to
12:04
get practical is first I fill out my entire story sheets just like in the
12:09
plotting workbooks that we've been filling out throughout the series so now I have the basic beats I know the Allies
12:15
I know the mirror moment I know the second doorway of no return or at least I have a good idea of it so what I'll do
12:20
is I will write that out on my scene grid which I'm going to show you in just a minute then I start to think about all
12:26
the scenes that I kind of have in my head because at least for me and you may
12:32
find this to be true for yourself I already have an idea of some of the scenes that I'm going to need for this
12:37
character so I may not know exactly where it fits but I know for example in
12:42
deep dark secrets that when I first started I knew there would be a scene where mariah has to have interaction
12:50
with her ex-boyfriend and his new girlfriend and I knew that was going to cause some conflict for her in her
12:56
desire and her emotional goal to let things go back to normal and it's hard
13:01
to do that and to pretend everything's okay when you're facing this guy that you used to really care about and he's
13:07
now dating one of your best friends I knew that that was going to be a scene so what I did is I wrote it down on an
13:12
index card and I put it in a pile now even though you may not know where these things go in terms of
13:18
chronology of your story if you have a bunch of ideas for scenes that you might want to write and you're just not sure
13:24
where they go go ahead and write them down jot them on note cards and put them in a stack or you can also use post-it
13:30
notes and then we're going to use those in a few minutes then what I do next is I start to think about if I'm starting
13:36
at the very beginning of the story I usually already have that opening scene in my mind and I know of course at this
13:42
point what the first doorway of no-return is going to be so now I start to think what is the logical progression
13:49
and timeline of what has to happen to get my character from that first scene
13:54
to the end of Act one so for example if we're looking at deep dark secrets that we've been talking about throughout this
14:00
plot series what that means is at the very beginning of the story mariah is getting out of rehab she's been in rehab
14:07
or the hospital for over a year she hasn't seen her friends she hasn't been to school and now she is going to be
14:14
going back to school for her senior year so I know that that is already set up in that first scene of the book now what
14:21
has to happen in the first doorway of no return for her is that she's at her locker at school she opens up the locker
14:28
and a note falls out from her dead friend Haley that says if I'm dead it wasn't an accident and that is the first
14:35
turning point or the first doorway of no return where she makes the decision that she is going to find out the truth of
14:40
what happened that night of the accident so in order to get my character logically from rehab to that moment with
14:48
her locker I know there are a few things that have to happen logically number one she has to go home from rehab so she has
14:55
to actually make the trip and I know that that's also going to mean emotionally like being reunited with her
15:01
sister it's also going to mean seeing her room for the first time and what that entails it's also going to mean at
15:08
some point going back to school because how is she at her locker if school hasn't started yet so I need to think
15:13
about what all is gonna happen to this character as she begins school has school already started or are they gonna
15:19
have senior picture day and then as I'm brainstorming what all needs to happen chronologically ideas for scenes will
15:26
start to come to me I also then look at the emotional journey of my character I know that at
15:32
the beginning of the story she's a broken mess but she is determined that she is going to lie to everyone around her so that they don't
15:39
send her back to rehab she is determined and her goal at the beginning of the story is to pretend that everything is
15:45
going back to normal and that whatever they say happened that night was absolutely true and she's not gonna
15:51
fight it any longer that's her goal but I know that I have to get her emotionally from that moment
15:57
where she just wants things to go back to normal to a doorway of no return where she says screw that I am going to
16:03
find out what really happened because I know I'm not crazy and so I have to take her on that journey emotionally as well
16:09
so thinking about where she is in the beginning and where she needs to go by the end of Act one begins to begins to
16:16
loosen up these ideas and this brainstorm of all the different scenes that need to happen and another tool
16:22
that I use is I just used the imagination tool I guess or like seeing things play through my head like a movie
16:29
so I will actually think about like ok I know she's in this scene where she's in rehab and what's going to happen next so
16:37
I will literally just close my eyes and start to imagine my character playing
16:42
out through these scenes and I will think ok if I were in her shoes if I were living this or if I was seeing this
16:49
in a movie what would I expect to happen next what's going to be the next logical thing ok I know I've got to have this
16:55
moment where she's reunited with her parents and I want to add some conflict in tension there where things don't seem
17:01
exactly the way she wants them to be then I know she's got to get from rehab to her house which means a car ride is
17:08
it important to show that car ride or not and the way that I make a decision about whether that car ride is actually
17:14
important to show or whether I want to transition to her being back at the house is is there anything that we're
17:20
going to learn as a reader in that scene that is going to increase the conflict and give my character sort of a new
17:27
roadblock to face or is there some sort of character arc or plot point that needs to come out during that car scene
17:33
now as you will see with deep dark secrets I decided to show pieces of the actual car ride home
17:40
to show how her goal of letting everything go back to normal is going to be very difficult to achieve because of
17:47
the way her mother and father are treating her after she's been getting out of rehab as well as the fact that
17:53
she can't pretend everything is okay when she practically goes into a panic attack just from being in a car again so
18:00
it is important to show that and it is logical then the question that I start to ask myself is what's the next logical
18:06
step for Mariah at this point what does this scene lead into and is that an
18:12
important scene to show how does that further the plot and then once I have decide how that next scene furthers the
18:18
plot I ask what would happen next what's her reaction to it and what does she decide to do next all the while keeping
18:24
in mind that I'm heading toward that act1 climax of her finding the note so
18:30
hopefully this helps you see like how you can work through the idea of these scenes whether or not you want to
18:35
actually write down specifics of what happens in each scene or if you just want to kind of write the scenes and see
18:42
where they go is entirely up to you and what works for your process but I'm trying to give you just a few tools that
18:47
you can use along the way something else to keep in mind as you go through the story is that and this is such a great
18:54
reason to read Jack Bickham scene in structure because he talks about this in the beginning of the story and this is
18:59
where I find a lot of writers go wrong is that every cause in your story needs to have an effect and every effect or
19:07
every plot point needs to have a cause now what he means by that is readers
19:13
expect to be taken on a journey they want everything in the story to seem completely logical like they understand
19:19
exactly why these characters are acting this way they understand why certain things happen in the story even if they
19:26
were unexpected so logical even if it's unexpected one example that he gives of
19:31
everything that is an effect needing to have a cause is he says let's say you have two characters on a spaceship and
19:38
they're fighting you've got the hero in the villain they're on a spaceship out in outer space and there's only one
19:44
escape pod and all of a sudden the power goes out there's no fuel or whatever the
19:50
spaceship is is on a collision course with a meteor somewhere in the middle of space and now there's no steering left on the ship
19:56
with that one escape pod only one person is getting off that ship which then creates a battle between the hero and
20:03
the villain who are going to have to fight to the death to see who gets that last pod well the problem with this is
20:09
what caused the spaceship to malfunction in the first place if you really want to
20:15
tell a great story you're going to have to give some sort of logical reason for that effect what is the cause of that
20:22
spaceship malfunctioning well all you have to do is if there's some sort of effect or plot point that you want to
20:28
happen in the story you just need to backwards manufacturer and say okay what could have happened that caused this it
20:35
could be that the antagonist or the villain themselves messed with the mechanical operations of the plane or of
20:42
the spaceship thinking that you know they would win or they would force this battle it could be that the spaceship
20:47
had earlier hit a meteor and it damaged the ship in the first place but whatever it is you need to have some reason it
20:54
can't just be bad luck that it just happened the ship just happened to stop working at this place where you needed
20:59
it to happen as an author fiction should always seem to make more sense than real life in real life bad luck happens
21:06
things don't make sense we don't know why people do things they just do them but in fiction there always needs to be
21:12
a reason why we need to know the character's motivation we need to know why things have happened we need to see
21:18
the effects of things that you bring out into the story another example he gives where every cause needs to have an effect is that
21:25
you know if you show a tornado or a huge storm you can't the next day show that everything is perfectly fine
21:31
you need to have your characters reacting to that storm and that storm needed to have some kind of reason to be
21:37
in the story in the first place or else why have the storm so we need to see the
21:42
effects of it we need to see the houses that have been torn down we need to see the trees that have been uprooted and we
21:48
need to see how your characters have been affected by that storm so be careful that you don't put things into
21:53
your story just because they seem cool everything needs to have a reason and every cause needs to have an effect and
21:59
every effect or every plot point and every action and reaction needs to have a reason behind it
22:05
motivation behind it and whether that is your chance to tell backstory or whether it's your chance to show your
22:11
character's motivation and show their wound or their ghost of their past is up to you but keep that idea of cause and
22:18
effect in somewhere in the back of your mind every time you're working through your story what I'm gonna do now is I'm
22:23
going to show you how I go about plotting the next part of my story and how I bring it all together when I'm
22:29
brainstorming my scenes and like I said you can do as much or as little of this as possible and I take it one step at a
22:37
time thinking logically through the chronology of the story thinking about the threads and the things that must
22:43
happen to get my character from one point to another and I always ask myself the question when I you know when I'm
22:49
thinking about a scene I'm always asking is this a logical growth from you know the next scene is this the next logical
22:55
step or am I missing something in here like I think that a lot of times authors are afraid that they're gonna make their
23:01
story boring by showing this car ride or by showing you know this character getting back to school it's like am i
23:07
showing too much and sometimes that can be boring but the way to know if it fits in the story or not is how does it move
23:12
the plot forward is it something that the reader needs to see in order to understand why things are progressing
23:18
the way they are and you need to ask yourself those questions constantly as you're finishing up the plot of your
23:23
story but I always ask you know is this the next logical step from the previous scene how does this scene move the plot
23:30
forward how is it are we showing character growth are we showing conflict are we introducing new conflict are we
23:36
introducing a totally new disaster that's going to lead the character on this second part of their journey and
23:42
then how does this scene lead into the next one and as long as you continue to
23:47
ask yourself those questions as you plot and you keep in mind those basic sort of
23:52
anchors of the first doorway of no return at the end of Act one your midpoint your second doorway where your
23:58
characters are at the climax and you constantly keep pushing with every scene you're pushing them more towards that
24:04
next inevitable plot point you're gonna be right on track so I'm gonna pass you on to the voiceover while we take a look
24:10
at deep dark secrets okay so by now hopefully you filled out all of these
24:16
character sheets you've got your care - Ark your act 1 act 2 and act 3 so now
24:21
take the next sheet which I call my scene grid and this has basically all four sections of your novel that you're
24:29
going to begin to fill out so I just will usually put the title of the book at the top and then I will show this
24:37
first section will be act 1 then act 2 part 1 act 2 part 2 and act 3 and I'm
24:43
going to now start thinking about the scenes that are gonna go through this now another thing that I like to do is I
24:49
like to figure out what my estimated word count is so we're gonna say a hundred thousand just because it's easy math so then I've divided by four and
24:56
figure out basically just a guideline of where I want to be at the end of each act so I want to be at 25,000 words so I
25:04
know I need enough scenes enough conflict to get me through about 25,000
25:09
words then I start going through what I already have figured out from the previous work that I've done and start
25:17
adding in those scenes like for example the prologue where there's the accident then Mariah leaves rehab then I know
25:24
maybe not the scenes in between but I know that that Act one climaxes that Mariah Mariah finds the note in her
25:30
locker that it wasn't an accident and she makes the decision to investigate then I might go through and take
25:37
everything I know about Act two and start filling in those upper scenes that will lead me to the midpoint which is
25:43
the scene where she goes back to the bridge Jordan is there and she decides to open up to him and realizes that
25:51
she's not crazy and that there really is something more going on here then I'm gonna take act 2 where her reaction and
25:59
the the next scene to that is that Jordan tells her the truth about his brother and so on and I'll start writing
26:04
out those scenes leading up to what I also know as the second doorway of no return is that they go to see the
26:10
medicine woman who tells them about the idols and the evil spirit that is trapped inside Mariah and I just go
26:17
through this process of figuring out you know writing out the scenes that I do know where they're placed in the story
26:24
and just kind of giving myself that framework so like the end of the book we've got Nicole's funeral
26:31
this area where they look for the idols and the first one is intact but the
26:36
second one is broken so I've got these basic parts that will anchor my story
26:42
now from this part of you know the scenes that I've written out in act 2 I
26:47
also know some of the other scenes but I may not know exactly where they fit in order so what I also can do is you know
26:54
on the back of that scene grid I also have a place to write your scenes list now like I said you can do this in index
27:01
cards or you can just start writing it out on a sheet of paper and here's where you get a chance to be a little bit more detailed rather than just writing
27:08
prologue accident you could write out something more specific like the night of the accident it's raining hailey
27:15
deliberately jerks the steering wheel to take them over the bridge chapter 1 mariah has a nightmare she
27:21
wakes up to realize that it's her release day and she's gonna meet with dr. Milner dr. Miller Milner is gonna
27:28
give her the medallion that reminds her of this dream that she's been having of
27:33
a Native American man who gave her this medallion which is immediately part of
27:38
the conflict because her goal here was to act like everything was normal and to
27:43
believe this story that they told her and now she's getting evidence that what she truly believed about this Native
27:50
American dark-haired man who gave her this medallion is true so you could go so far as to write out the goal of the
27:57
scene the conflict that your character faces in the scene as well as the disaster moment that we were talking
28:02
about and you could also write that out on your note cards if you wanted to get really specific and then write out a
28:09
description of the scene and like I said it just kind of depends how deep into the plotting process you want to go and
28:16
how specific you want to go or if you want to be a little bit more general by
28:21
just writing out those like bullet points that might get you through the story it's totally up to you I also
28:27
wanted to show you guys that I have this happy planner like deluxe notebooks that
28:33
I have tabs written for each of my stories and then inside of it I have
28:38
taken some old happy planner pages and I have created my story grid inside the
28:44
happy plane pages so I've got act 1 broken into two parts there with 12,500 words
28:50
25,000 words and then act 2 parts 1 and 2 written there with act 3 at the end
28:56
and then the bottom section I use for notes and I like to do this and then what I'll do is I'll print out basically
29:03
the plotting notebook and since this is disks I can punch those and put them into my notebook and keep all my notes
29:09
in one section another thing that I have is I will use these plotting notebooks
29:18
like just made out of index cards and if you guys are interested in this at all I will link below my videos where I show
29:25
in depth how I use the plotting happy planner as well as the plotting notebook to plot my story but basically what I
29:33
would begin to do at this point is brainstorm all of the scenes that go in between and the value of writing them
29:39
out first is that I can begin to sort of mix them up and figure out where they best fit okay guys so hopefully that has
29:48
given you at least an idea of where to start when I am plotting I love to write out the scenes that I know like all of
29:55
those things that I've figured out throughout the course of like what are the tests and trials when you're you're
30:00
figuring out you know most of act 2 you sort of already have worked through hopefully some of those scenes but you
30:06
know might not know yet exactly what order they happen or exactly what goal you know conflict and disaster is gonna
30:14
happen in each scene so I love to have those note cards written down like I've got the bullet points when I know where
30:20
it's gonna fit in the story but then sometimes you'll see me when I'm plotting with a whole bunch of note
30:26
cards sitting out on the floor around me and I'll just be kind of moving them around and saying you know okay this
30:32
scene I know needs to happen but does it happen after she visits Hailey's mother or before and then I'll start to just
30:38
really think about the progression and the character arc and think where is this best to push her in this way in
30:44
terms of pacing is it better to have this here have this scary moment or should I add in a more emotional moment
30:50
some of this for you is going to feel intuitive as you work through it and some of it will be trial and error
30:56
you'll learn and some of it will be things that your beta readers or some of your alpha readers or your editor will
31:03
say you know what I think this is better over here but the key is to just try your best to work out as much of it as
31:08
you need so that you can start writing I try to get as specific as possible until I know that I'm ready to write and when
31:16
I'm chomping in the bit to write I get this feeling inside that says okay I'm ready to write the scene and I just
31:21
start going for it but it's so useful to have those note cards or that plotting sheet where I can say okay I finished
31:28
this scene I'm ready for my next sprint and I start writing that next one right away because I know exactly what's
31:33
coming and that's part of what has allowed me to write six books in the last year which has been my most
31:39
productive year by far of my life or twenty five novels in the last eight years of my life and part of how I've
31:46
been as prolific as I have is that I use this type of plotting method and I continue to refine it and hopefully get
31:53
better over time now before we go I did want to just briefly mention how I use
31:58
this in terms of writing a series now deep dark secrets the book that you've been going through with me is book one
32:04
in my spirit Walker's trilogy which will be three books and as I was setting up that ending obviously and everything
32:10
that happens toward the end of this book I was already thinking about how that's going to play into the last two novels
32:16
but I also have my shadow demon saga which I'm currently working on book ten and it also has some side story novels
32:23
so I do have experience plant plotting both you know standalone novels as well as really long series now when I first
32:31
started beautiful demons which is book one in my shadow demon saga I did not know that this was going to be a twelfth
32:36
book series with lots of other things the story just continue to grow as I was writing but I did have the idea for that
32:43
main first plot that first story arc that was going to lead into something
32:49
with an evil organization now as I worked through it you don't always have to know where you're going to be at the
32:55
end of the series sometimes you will like with my zombie trilogy my eternal sorrow series I know exactly when I
33:01
started writing where this series was going to end but with demons it's been so long that I had no idea where this
33:08
story was going when I first started but what I did was in the same way we
33:13
talk about scene and sequel that you're setting up the scene and then you have you know some sort of reaction and then
33:21
your character makes a new decision that leads them into the next plot point I will use that on a larger scale with my
33:27
series and I will think okay if I want this character to be here by the end of
33:32
the story arc what do they need to learn in each book along the way and what is going to happen at the end of this that
33:39
is going to push that character into the next segment of the story so I use the same basic structure that I've been
33:46
using for the novel itself on a much larger scale when it comes to the entire series and that helps me sort of bring
33:52
it all together now you do have different types of novels and series where each book is its own kind of
33:58
standalone story like in romances that will often be the case but then when you have a series like my shadow demon saga
34:05
where each book builds upon the of your gonna plot that and plan it in a very similar way to how we just plotted out
34:11
all of those scenes so if you would like to see a video with more specific direction on how to plot or plan out a
34:18
series that is going to be a longer series where each bit builds on the other please comment down below and let
34:23
me know but for now I think that concludes this part of our plotting series guys that is it we have made it
34:30
through the seventh video the only thing that we have left is video number eight
34:35
which is all about what happens when you get stuck what happens if you have writer's block or you just can't figure
34:42
out what comes next well I have some tools and tricks for you that we'll be discussing in my next video and that
34:48
next video is actually coming tomorrow so this will end our a part video series

hey everybody welcome back to Hart breathing's I know there have not been as many videos this year but I'm gonna
0:05
hopefully kind of explain what's been going on what's kind of held me back and it's Kanban board day which is so
0:12
exciting to me because it is already way into January its January 21st as I'm
0:18
recording this and I had not set up my Kanban board yet so I was feeling way
0:24
behind very discombobulated because I like to have my board set up and to know
0:30
exactly what tasks I'm working on I did actually have all of my goals figured out and I had worked through my entire
0:36
HB 90 goal-setting system so I had the sticky notes of made but I was just
0:41
waiting for a chance to actually record this for you guys so they didn't actually go up on the board until today
0:47
so I'm gonna show you that process and kind of walk you through it so if you're interested in seeing how I set up my Kanban board to help achieve my goals
0:54
every 90 days stay tuned okay so like I
1:01
said just a minute ago I actually had already set up my q1 goals so kind of
1:07
rewinding a little bit if you're new to my channel my name is Sarah cannon I am an indie author which means that I
1:13
started my own self-publishing like my own publishing company back in 2010 and I have since written and published over
1:20
25 novels and sold nearly three-quarters of a million books and it was one of
1:26
those things like when I decided to be an indie author a self-published author and do everything kind of myself I never
1:33
dreamed that I was also signing up to be an entrepreneur I just didn't even realize that I was now going to be a
1:39
business owner I was just thinking of myself as a writer and I was thinking about getting these books out to my fans
1:44
but as time has gone on and the business has become more complicated and there's
1:50
so much more involved I have spent a lot of my time taking productivity and business courses and learning more about
1:56
the actual like business of being an entrepreneur and of being a publisher and of being a writer so I'm constantly
2:02
trying to find that balance between being a creative person who is having to
2:08
sit down every day and you know get excited about stories and create worlds and learn my
2:13
craft and be just a hundred percent a writer and then also having to be someone who is basically a business
2:19
owner and has to understand taxes and how business is structured and how mailing lists work and how to promote
2:25
and publish my books and all of those other things and then of course in 2018
2:30
I added a second business where I added this YouTube channel and all of my courses and planners that go along with
2:36
that so it has taken a lot to kind of come up with my own rhythm and my own
2:41
flow but I feel like I've really found something that works for me so if you have been either trying to manage or
2:48
balance a full-time job with wanting to be creative or you've got all these goals that you've been really wanting to
2:54
accomplish and you just feel like you don't have the time or you can't get focused then maybe something like this
3:00
system will help you so let me walk you through exactly what I do so I plan 90
3:06
days at a time I do this specifically because when I used to plan an entire
3:12
year at once I would find myself getting so far behind early on that it would
3:17
just throw my entire plan off and instead of just continuing on and then finding a place to stop and review I was
3:23
just constantly trying to revamp my schedule like at January 20th I'm two weeks behind so let me just scrap the
3:29
entire year's plan and restart and I had no really good system for judging
3:34
whether I was reaching my goals I basically just had this huge to-do list of things and whatever grabbed my
3:41
attention at any given moment was what I would do so if I would think okay I know I really need to work on my newsletter I
3:47
would start working on that and then somebody would email me and say hey did you take care of this promotion thing and are you gonna write this short story
3:53
and will you do this other thing and so my attention was constantly fractured and what I found was that I was never really getting anything done I
4:01
was busy all the time but I was never actually feeling like I was accomplishing things so other you know
4:08
other than getting my books written there were so many other things that I wanted to get done that were important
4:13
to my business that just weren't I didn't know how to prioritize so I decided to plan 90 days at a time and a
4:21
pivotal course that I took that helped me with that was Todd Herman's 90-day year don't know if it's open for enrollment
4:27
he opens it a few times a year but that is a really great course if you're interested in learning how to 90-day
4:32
plan so that was really one of the first introductions to me and of course I took what I learned at his course and over
4:39
time have sort of altered it into my own system and things that work for me so he
4:45
didn't teach me about the Kanban board but I felt like this was a great tool for me to help visually see my goals and
4:52
my tasks all at once so walking you through this what I do is at the end of every quarter I will take a week or two
4:59
to sit down and review how my last 90 days has gone what I got done what I
5:05
didn't get done if I didn't have enough time or where I kind of failed and we'll
5:10
talk about that a little bit because I did not clear my board this last 90 days and then what I do is I set new goals
5:17
for this upcoming quarter and for me a goal is something that is a measurable
5:23
outcome that I can't control so instead of saying I'm going to write a book as
5:29
my goal that would be a project my goal however is to publish new books so that
5:35
I can raise my income to $20,000 a month and when I set that goal I can't control
5:41
if I'm actually going to make that amount of money but what I can control is whether I get the project's done that
5:47
are listed underneath it and there's a lot of reasons behind setting goals in this manner and I can do more videos on
5:53
that but basically I just want to give you kind of an overview of what I'm how I work this system I set no more than
6:00
three goals for myself and pretty much always the first two goals are having to
6:05
do with my writing career and the third goal has to do with heart breathing's and I'll explain this more when I'm setting up my board but the first goal
6:12
is almost always having to do with what I'm writing currently so my writing projects and my promotion number two is
6:19
usually like fan interaction and administrative tasks that have to do with my writing career and then number
6:25
three is more of heart breathing so all my videos and courses that are related to that and I'll show you why I have a
6:32
fourth goal up on the board and what I use that for in just a minute so in my planner that I sell on Etsy at
6:39
called the HP 90 system I actually have sheets where you can go through the whole process of setting your goals and
6:46
then you break those goals down into projects and then you break the project's down into tasks those tasks
6:52
are where my sticky notes come from on my Kanban board so for example my goal number one for this quarter is to
6:58
publish and promote both new and backlist titles in order to increase my publishing income and I have some
7:04
numbers attached that but I'm not going to share them right now and then I have
7:09
projects listed underneath that and these projects are projects that are specifically going to help me reach that
7:15
goal of publishing promoting new books and backless titles in order to raise my
7:20
income so faith surrender is one example of a project that I have for this
7:26
quarter so I'm going to write edit publish my book fates surrender and then
7:31
underneath that project I have an entire list like a huge list of tasks from
7:37
everything from finalizing the plot of that book to writing the words to editing the book to sending it out to my
7:44
beta readers to sending it to my editor to announcing the cover reveal and all of the things that go into publishing
7:50
that book when I set up that project to put it up on my Kanban board I will
7:55
break it down into as minuscule things like stuff I can finish in a week so I
8:01
have them written into like 5,000 words so there's a sticky note up there for every single 5000 word category so it'll
8:08
say faith surrender 5000 they'd surrender 10000 fates are under 15,000 and actually think I actually just say F
8:14
s FS 15 20 25 30 and so on so that every week I can move at least 5,000 words
8:21
down and all the way down to the bottom typically when I'm drafting a book I try to write between 15 and 25 thousand
8:28
words a week of the rough draft so I will actually just move the first 5,000
8:33
down and then when that's done I can move it down to the bottom and then move the 10 to the getting done part but I
8:39
have that project I have vengeful darkness which I'm no I'm not going to
8:45
be publishing this quarter but I'm hoping that I can actually draft a good bit of it which is book 11 in my shadow demon saga I also have some promotion
8:52
things that are gonna get done and I have an assistant who's helping me that I have a short story that needs to be turned in and I
8:58
have some stuff that I'm going to do promotion wise with some of my backlist like my sacrifice me title so all of
9:05
those tasks and projects are on sticky notes up on the board under goal number
9:11
one which is the blue ones and those are all related to publishing and promoting my back list and I will kind of explain
9:18
the rest of those goals as I'm setting up the board because I'm going to rewind you guys and show you like a little bit
9:24
of a review of how I did in q4 so let's get to that now okay so this is
9:30
basically my Kanban completed Kanban board for q4 and as you can see I did not finish everything and part of that
9:38
is the main thing that I didn't finish here is my writing goals I've been over this in a previous video but if you're
9:44
not familiar with how I set up my Kanban board you can see up here at the top I have a one two three and four and then
9:52
very lightly I have just like a white washi tape that's going down here to sort of give it those four columns and
9:58
then this top part says master plan so as you'll see in just a second I'm going to set up this whole top part as my
10:05
entire master plan for the entire quarter so I plan 90 days at a time and so I'm setting up every single task and
10:12
project that I'm going to be working on over the next 90 days and then as I pull a task so this is like Facebook log
10:19
number two if I decide that I'm going to be working on that this week then on Sunday I come in I put that in this get
10:27
it done section which means that I am currently working on this this is a task that I'm worried about for this week or
10:33
that I'm working on currently right now then when I finish it like if I finish my Facebook live then I would come in
10:40
move it down to the awesome job pile which is basically my done section traditionally a lot of times you'll see
10:46
Kanban boards go from left to right but this is the space I had on the wall and
10:52
so it's kind of the only place I had to really do this board in my office this year so I decided to go from top to
11:00
bottom and that really works for me and really it's more about the functionality of it than it is about which way you're
11:06
doing it this may not be traditional but this works for me plus I love seeing the migration of everything going from you
11:13
know these are the things I have to do - this is the stuff that's already done and on any given week when I walk into
11:19
my office cuz this is right next to the door I can look up and I can say okay what am i working on and there will
11:24
usually be I think traditionally with Kanban boards you're only supposed to have one task in the middle at a time
11:30
it's not the way I do it kind of made it work for myself so I do everything I'm basically going to be working on this
11:36
week goes in the middle so there might be one or two green ones or there'll be a blue one or a pink one when it comes
11:43
to my word counts I have in the past tried to do just like rough draft well
11:50
it turns out you know it takes me months to write a rough draft so it's not as motivational to have like thanks or in
11:58
the rough draft up here for two months while I'm working on it so what I decided to do was break it down into
12:04
five thousand word chunks so I've got them down to like starting at five
12:09
thousand all the way down to a hundred thousand words and so if I'm working on a forty thousand to get to forty
12:16
thousand this week then I would just put this one here and if I finish that I would move it down to the bottom and go
12:21
ahead and move the forty five down here as well because I might be able to get all of those words in one week but I
12:27
would never put both the forty and the forty five because this one has to happen before this one can get done so
12:33
it's kind of like I've set my own little rules for myself and if you have any questions about that feel free to pop them down in the
12:40
comments below if you kind of wonder how it works because I've sort of I did some study and research on how traditional
12:46
comma boards work but after using them myself a couple of years I sort of came up with my own rules for what motivates me and I
12:53
think that that is really like one of the most important things is what's gonna motivate you so basically my q4 I
13:01
spent a lot of time at working you can see I've got a ton of both these reliefs
13:07
teal color ones and the pink I spent a lot of time working on videos for her free things and stuff I did not have as
13:13
many tasks for this number two goal which is more towards my like fan relationships and things like
13:19
administrative tasks for my writing career so the way I do is usually goal
13:24
number one for me is almost always having to do with what books I'm writing and promoting number two is usually more
13:30
to do with like things I'm doing with my fans like Facebook lives are working on my Facebook group or Instagram or
13:37
paperbacks and sort of admin stuff my goal number three is always having to do
13:42
with this YouTube channel and with heart breathing's with my courses and then I only have three main business goals
13:47
every quarter but I always have a fourth over here and the yellow is always more like my personal things so these are
13:53
like courses I want to take books I want to read if I want to get into like a meditation practice or exercising more
14:00
that stuff goes on the yellow and I don't really stress about whether or not I get the yellow things done it's just
14:06
up there to kind of motivate me to work on those so cute for review as you can
14:12
see I did really well with YouTube and I had actually only planned I think I put
14:18
6,500 up here that I was like this is just sort of like a milestone thing where I would say like trying to get to
14:24
6,500 YouTube subscribers and if you were hanging around by the end of the year you know that I got to over I
14:30
believe 11,000 by the end of the year so that was super exciting but I got a lot of videos done I ran a course I got the
14:37
new planner up so a lot of stuff happened but there was still a lot of things that didn't get done like this is
14:43
a course that I signed up for called blog tube is hive that I did not complete I didn't really even get
14:49
started on it so I just didn't have time and then just a few other things I a resource library I want to get a
14:54
better welcome sequence going for my newsletter list but the most important things got done now when it comes to my
15:01
second goal which was more relating to my fans I really missed a lot of opportunities here so I got some
15:08
Facebook collabs done I did some promotions I had hoped to do a NaNoWriMo vlog and that just did not happen at all
15:15
I basically completely failed NaNoWriMo this year but life happens so I didn't
15:21
get as many Facebook lives I didn't finish putting up some digital wallpapers and then I didn't update some
15:26
of my files that needed to be updated which is kind of like an administrative task and then when it comes to goal
15:33
number one that was more my writing goal and I did get a book written and completed and published in October but I
15:40
hoped to have faith surrender which is the third book in my eternal sorrows series I had hoped to have that one
15:46
completely done as well and that just didn't happen which I'll talk about a little bit more later on in this video
15:52
but overall I think I did really well I think I just bit off a lot more than I could chew in the last part of the year
15:58
because I think I forget how busy things get towards the end of the year so hopefully I'll be able to remember that a little bit more for next year and even
16:05
though it is now January 21st I am just now going to be setting up my Kanban
16:11
board and goals for q1 because I really wanted to get that recorded for you guys
16:16
so this is gonna be really exciting for me to finally pull all these down and set up fresh so I promise you guys I
16:21
told you guys in that little explanation I would tell you a little bit about why I came short of my goals in q4 I think
16:30
on YouTube it can be kind of hard to know you know when to go more personal and when to hold things back but I just
16:35
am NOT usually the kind of person who holds a lot of things back and sometimes I think it is relevant to what you guys
16:43
are going through as well that sometimes life happens like I have students in my HP 90 course that have lost parents
16:50
during the middle of the course or during the middle of the quarter or had other tragedies or traumas or have
16:57
gotten very ill and had to kind of back off and you know it's great to try to be as productive as you can and to have all
17:03
these aspirations and goal and projects that you want to complete but sometimes there are things that
17:09
happen that you just need to also learn to say okay this isn't going to get done
17:14
and that's okay and I will move on to the next quarter and everything's going to work out so I had one of those kind
17:20
of experiences for myself in q4 I had a plan to finish book ten and publish book
17:26
ten of my shadow demon saga then I was going to over the course of NaNoWriMo in
17:31
November I was going to draft the entire book of fate surrender which is the
17:37
final book in my eternal sorrows trilogy and I was really excited because so far in 2018 I had met all of my publishing
17:44
goals and it was really the first year I've ever done that so I was like oh my gosh I've just got this one book to go
17:50
and I'm gonna totally have like you know nailed all my goals for this year and I was really excited about that and I had
17:56
a plan in my second goal to do a daily or sort of maybe like a weekly NaNoWriMo
18:03
vlog and I was going to talk about my writing process and all kinds of stuff and I had a lot of goals having to do
18:09
with that a lot of projects set up but this is where the personal stuff comes in so you can feel free to fast forward
18:17
if you don't want to hear about this I know that I talk a lot about productivity and getting things done but
18:22
I also want you to know that you know we're not robots we're not able you know we're creative beings were people who
18:29
are you know trying to do our best but life is not going to fall apart if you don't clear off your board so with that
18:35
being said my husband and I have been trying to have a baby a second baby we
18:40
have a son who is six for the past two years and it has been a very emotional
18:46
journey I have polycystic ovarian syndrome PCOS which affects about one in
18:52
ten women so it is quite common but it is one of the leading causes of infertility and even though we had to go
18:58
through a lot of fertility treatments to have my son we decided we were not going
19:04
to go through any kind of infertility stuff this time around it's expensive it's emotionally draining it's very
19:10
difficult and if you've been through that you you sort of understand so we weren't sure if it was possible for us
19:16
to have a baby and so after two years of trying we finally got
19:22
pregnant so I found out in October that I was pregnant and I was trying to take it easy I knew I had a book due but I
19:28
was also trying to take it super easy I was obviously not feeling great first trimester stuff I was super tired but I
19:36
was you know focused on getting the book done and focused on staying healthy and about a week before the book came out or
19:44
was supposed to come out and I still had like I am one of those people who like the week before a book release I am
19:50
still in a mad dash to finish final edits to you know finish putting in all of my my editors comments and everything
19:57
else so it's like there's so much work that goes into that last week before and so the week before the Monday before the
20:05
book came out I had a miscarriage and I know that it's something that a lot of people don't talk about it's kind of a
20:10
taboo thing to talk about but I felt like I wanted to share this because you
20:17
know when we're talking about achieving our goals and setting up all of these things that we want to do I just want
20:24
you guys to know that you know you don't have to be perfect you don't have to go in and say you know I'm gonna be this
20:30
person who gets up every single day and moves these things down the board and I'm gonna be perfect and if I'm not then
20:36
I'm gonna judge myself for it it's not a tool to beat yourself up and there are
20:41
going to be times when you lose a friend you lose a family member you have a
20:47
health problem you have a miscarriage but for me it was devastating and I
20:53
really struggled with it I had to end up put it pushing the book back by a few days I sort of went into a cave of grief
21:02
and you know I didn't have any videos going up right away at that point and I just needed a break
21:08
and I thought once I got the book published which came out I believe like October 31st so it was a few days late
21:14
but it still got out in October I thought once I got that book done I would be able to maybe take a week off
21:20
and then get right back into the swing of things with the NaNoWriMo but that just did not happen it ended up
21:27
devastating me more than I expected and I a really really tough time recovering
21:33
and getting back into writing so there was a part of me come December when I
21:39
completely failed NaNoWriMo I didn't even write 10,000 words for Nano that I
21:44
was trying to like not feel panicked to not feel completely devastated that oh
21:51
my gosh like I have wasted an entire month and here I had this amazing year of productivity and the very end of the
21:58
year is going to be the least productive part and you know I was really struggling with that sort of perfectionism and that desire to you
22:06
know it's it's a balance being entrepreneurs a balance it's like I wanted and I have all these goals and I'm very goal-driven and I wanted to
22:12
make that happen but then you know the part of me that is a human being person
22:18
like not a writer not an entrepreneur not a goal get our kind of person just just a person needed time and space and
22:26
I actually needed a lot more time and space than I realized so even though I continued to get videos
22:31
out and I still did my course and got my planner out and things like that it was a really tough recovery time for me
22:38
emotionally and so I just needed that time and I want to encourage you that
22:44
you know if you set up your board and you have all these big goals and you've
22:50
set up your 90 days and something happens and you just need a break don't beat yourself up over it because I found
22:56
myself like really anytime I would not give myself just the grace of like okay
23:03
you need a couple days where you can just sit in your PJs and cry and you know eat you know fruit and sit on the
23:10
couch and watch you know binge watch youtube or something or Netflix and it's going to be okay and you know I hope
23:17
this is OK for me to share here because it is not a plea for you know getting a bunch of comments from people to say I'm
23:24
so sorry because I know it is a very personal and emotional thing I really
23:30
just wanted to share this because you know we talk so often about how to be productive how to go after your goals
23:35
how to be consistent you know and all those things but being especially when you're creative entrepreneur and you're
23:42
a writer or you're some kind of crazed being like you're creating art or poetry or paint painting something or you're
23:49
creating a show or you're creating you know whatever it is that you're creating you're so like emotionally tied in to
23:56
what you're doing and so it can be really difficult to continue to create when you're emotionally devastated and
24:03
so give yourself the time that you need if you find that something happens that
24:09
you just need a break because life will go on your business will go on you will be able to recover
24:15
but sometimes if you try to push past and you don't take the time that you
24:20
need you could end up kind of being out of the game for a lot longer than you intended and you can burn out much
24:26
easier if you don't take the time that you need so I just took most of November
24:31
off I got a lot done with heart breathing's in December but I still didn't get a lot of writing done so here
24:37
we are in January and I still have not really gotten back to my complete writing routine and there are other
24:43
reasons for that that I'll hopefully share with you guys in a couple of weeks but I have just had kind of a hard time
24:50
getting back into routines and that's okay you know I'm not a robot and neither are you we are creative beings
24:57
and we're doing the best that we can and I think the key is to take the time that you need to grieve or to be sad or to
25:05
just take a break if you're feeling burned out and then come back with fresh eyes and think okay what is it I truly
25:10
want what is that I'm going after what is gonna bring me joy because joy really does matter and then setting up your
25:17
goals all over again so with all that being said now that it is January and of course we're a little
25:22
bit into the quarter already I have all these goals set up and I'm hoping you know I'm still gonna give myself a
25:29
little bit of time if I need it I may have you know by the end of March I may find that I've only done half the things
25:34
on this board and that's okay because it's a learning process to understand how to keep writing after trauma and you
25:41
know I'm gonna do the best I can but hopefully you guys will be here with me cheering me on as I continue on through
25:47
the rest of this quarter and you know even if I only get half these things done it's still going to be a win
25:52
because I'm still being you know very focused in what I'm spending my time so let me show you guys the setup of my
25:59
q1 Kanban board and kind of take you through what some of my goals are for this next quarter
26:05
[Music]
27:41
you [Music]
28:14
okay guys so that is basically it for the setup and review of my q4 Kanban
28:20
board and the setup of my goals and my you know Kanban tasks and everything for q1 of 2019 if you want to set up a
28:28
Kanban board up for yourself you can use a big space on the wall like this you can go top to bottom you can go left to
28:35
right whichever way you want to set it up you could even set it up in a notebook you could set it up on any part
28:40
of your wall I've had students that have set them up on doors or on big cabinets
28:46
wherever you have space you can set it up even if it's literally just inside your notebook and you're just putting
28:51
those stickies on there but all you have to do is figure out what your goals are break it down into projects so if you
28:58
want to increase your income think about what projects are going to help you increase your income what books do you want to write this quarter or if you
29:05
don't want to think about goals and projects and all of that you can just separate it into projects and set three
29:11
main projects for yourself I'm going to finish this book I'm going to start applying to you know agents and I'm
29:17
going to start Facebook group and those can be your three projects instead of setting up the goals if you want to go a
29:24
little bit deeper in how to set up goals projects and all of that for your life and figure out how to really plan ninety
29:30
days you can purchase my HP 90 planner that walks you through all of this whole
29:37
system or I will also put a link down below to sign up if you're interested in hearing more about my HP 90 course it's
29:43
just a three-day boot camp but it we go really intensive and all the stuff like walking you through the planner and
29:49
setting up your Kanban board and all of that stuff and that course will launch again in March so if you're interested you can sign up down below for an email
29:57
when that course goes live and a little bit more information about that but otherwise you can just start simple put
30:03
you know pick out three different colors of sticky notes put your tasks on there break them it down into a small
30:09
increments as you can I found that when I kept them very broad like I said like
30:15
write the rough draft and it was going to take me like a month or two months to finish it wasn't very motivational for
30:21
me so I learned to break down those tasks into things that I could complete in a day or in a week at the very most and so it
30:28
would be like if you know if you know you write 500 words a day on average then put down 500 words for every single
30:34
one of those sticky notes that you've always got something to move down I don't know why it is but it just feels really good to move those sticky notes
30:41
down the board it just makes me feel accomplished and it feels really good so actually as soon as I end of this video
30:48
I'm gonna walk over to that board and I'm gonna move everything down that I'm working on for this week and I'm going
30:53
to move the things that I've already completed and it's I know it's gonna feel great and it's gonna feel
30:59
motivational and especially after going through a period of time where I was sad and I was having a hard time getting
31:05
motivated again having this visual cue of like here's all my goals here's the things I want to get done and being able
31:11
to move them down and see that I'm being productive is super helpful to get me out of that space and get me excited to
31:16
go in the morning so I hope this has helped you I hope that you can use a piece of this system in your own productivity comment down below and let
31:23
me know what your goals are for this quarter and whether or not you have set up a Kanban board and if you would like
31:28

hey guys welcome back to heart breathing's today we continue our plotting series and we dive into the
0:06
elements of Act one if you are new to
0:12
this channel we are currently going through an eight part series on how to plot your novel we started out with just
0:19
an overview of story structure and everything we'd be talking about and then my last video was how to write
0:25
great characters and we went through some of the elements of writing a great character and some of the things I have found helpful to figure out before I
0:31
start writing so where we're going to go today is diving straight into the elements of act 1 now act 1 is where you
0:40
can find basically the main set up of the story we're introduced to most of
0:45
the main players now there might be some characters that don't appear until later in the story but we're introduced at
0:51
least to the heroine or hero of the story sometimes we meet the antagonist or we at least get a hint that there is
0:57
an antagonist out there there's some kind of conflict going on we need to find out for sure what are the stakes
1:03
here what is at risk if the story question isn't answered which means that we also figure out what the story
1:09
question is and I'm going to take you through all of these things as we get into actual examples of plotting but
1:15
just as an overview you're introduced to the characters you are given some sort
1:21
of hook or some sort of reason why you want to read this story what's going to make it interesting is there a mystery
1:27
is this a quirky heroine is there a love triangle what is it that's gonna hook readers in and make them want to keep
1:33
reading we're given some kind of idea already remember we talked about in the last video how to write great characters
1:39
is that every character tends to have some kind of wound or some sort of ghost
1:44
in their past something that happened that now affects them so we're going to enact one get a really strong hint of
1:51
what that wound is you may not as a writer completely spell out the wound but we're going to see the effects of
1:58
that wound so even if you don't say this character had a fire when she was little
2:03
and her stepfather died you may not totally spell that out but you can show that this character has bad
2:11
or traumatic memories of something that happened from when she was young and you can sort of introduce it as a mystery what happened to her
2:17
that made her feel this way so you don't necessarily have to give the entire wound but in Act one we absolutely need
2:23
to see the effects of the wound and how our character is sort of armoring themselves against the world to try to
2:30
protect herself or himself and we need to see basically what that character's
2:36
life is like before the story goes it doesn't mean you need to see them wake up and get breakfast and go throughout
2:41
their daily routine but we need some hint as to where are they now so the
2:46
reader gets anchored into the story of like who is this character and what kind of life have they lived up to this point
2:53
because throughout the story we know that everything is basically going to change so it gives that sort of before
2:59
picture it's going back to what we learned about your character in the previous video or the previous steps
3:04
you're going to learn a little bit about your characters outer goal or desire and a hint of what their inner desire is
3:12
through finding out what that wound is or what they really truly need you're also going to get some kind of inciting
3:19
incident or sometimes it's called the call to adventure where your heroine is or hero is enticed like hey come into
3:26
this story and they may refuse that call you might find a statement of the theme or at least an idea of what the theme of
3:33
the story is if there's a love interest you're definitely going to meet them in act one or at least by the end of Act
3:40
one we definitely want to see what your characters greatest hopes are and get a
3:45
sense for what their greatest fears are so these are all things that you want to introduce as you go through act 1
3:52
basically we're setting up the story we're introducing the characters and we're introducing what's going on in the
3:58
internal world of your hero or heroine and we're setting up what are the stakes of the story and what's the major
4:04
conflict and then by the end of act 1 we're going to have some kind of bang some kind of incident or event that is
4:12
going to pull your hero into a new way of being a new world a new story so to
4:18
speak so let's go through each of these elements and I'll walk you through an
4:24
example of one of my books as well okay so in my write great characters video I was taking you through my book
4:31
beautiful demons but as I started getting into Act one what I realized was a mistake is that when I was writing
4:38
beautiful demons back in 2010 I actually didn't have a lot of these plotting tools I was a new writer I had only
4:44
written a couple of books before hand and I was still getting my feet wet and learning about plotting so I had not
4:51
found a lot of these tools that I'm gonna introduce to you now so I did not plot as cohesively as I do now so it
4:59
didn't make for a great example so what I've done instead is I'm backtracking and instead of doing beautiful demons
5:06
I'm gonna do a more recent book of mine called deep dark secrets so again spoiler alerts galore if you have not
5:12
read this book and you want to read it you can pause this and read away and come back to the video later but
5:18
otherwise you're gonna get some spoilers and that'll just be fine but what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna take you back
5:23
through that character sheet very quickly and I'm going to introduce this character to you her name is Mariah
5:30
Freeman so instead of Harper from beautiful demons we're gonna meet Mariah who is my new heroine for the new book
5:36
so I'm just gonna briefly take you back through those things so you can get familiar with her character and how I filled out her character sheet and then
5:43
we'll start going into the elements of Act one for deep dark secrets as well as for your own plotting okay so as you can
5:50
see I've already filled this out my character's name is Mariah Freeman she
5:56
is 17 years old she has brown eyes and dark brown or black hair and she's five
6:02
foot six her other appearance notes I have is she has long hair tan skin and
6:07
she's half Native American half Japanese and she has dark clothes that she wears after the accident what does her deepest
6:14
desire is to find out the truth or at least to know that she isn't crazy she
6:20
truly needs to believe in herself and embrace her true powers and what happened in her past is that her best
6:27
friend drove them over a bridge and they were both accused of using drugs and her friend died and now mariah has been in
6:33
rehab for a year and what she believes to be true about herself now because of
6:39
that is that she's broken she's a liar that she's crazy and completely untrustworthy then she's most
6:45
afraid of because of that wind her biggest fear so that she's afraid she can't even trust herself or her own
6:50
memory she portrays herself to others as I'm fine she lies to them and tells them
6:57
what they want to hear to make them things she's okay for her true self deep down is that she is very powerful with
7:04
extraordinary strength and light so just an overview of her now going on to the
7:11
goal motivation of conflict we have again outer and inner conflict and I have two goals here so I've set set up
7:18
all of this stuff for two things at the beginning her goal is to leave her past behind so she can regain some freedom
7:23
and Trust from others but her memories won't leave her alone she's having too many flashbacks too many things bringing
7:29
her back to the past later her goal switches to finding out the truth about what happened that night because her own life could be in danger
7:36
too and her conflict is that she can't remember and the darkness is now coming
7:41
after her internally her goal is to believe in herself and embrace her true
7:47
light because without a clear true idea of who she is she will definitely be lost to the darkness but the conflict is
7:53
she doesn't remember everything that happened so she still doesn't trust herself the character arc the beginning
8:00
of the story she believes she's broken a terrible person she just wants to forget and by the middle she's thinking okay
8:06
I'm gonna face the truth head-on because I can't move on until I know the truth which is a change or Die moment which
8:11
I'll go over later and she also is thinking I have to by the end I have to embrace my light and my own power and
8:18
she begins to show her real strength okay guys thanks for letting me go back through that new character to kind of
8:25
give you an idea and hopefully that gives you just another example of how to fill out those sheets and I know I went
8:31
through that really quickly so feel free to watch that again several times but now let's get into Act one so if you
8:37
have your sheets printed out then you can follow along with me sorry that's kind of washed out in the light but if
8:45
you have your sheets you can go through this with me now and then I'm going to I'm just going to briefly walk you
8:50
through these elements and explain them in detail then I'm going to give you an example and show you how I would fill it out for my
8:57
book deep dark secrets as an example if you do not yet have your free plotting workbook you can go to my blog at heart
9:05
breathing's calm slash plot your novel and if you sign up for my newsletter list you can get a free copy of this
9:11
entire plotting workbook that I am filling out the link will be for you there for you down below so feel free to
9:18
go grab that if you are already on my newsletter list look back through your emails or shoot me an e-mail at sarah s
9:25
arra at heart breathing's calm and I will send it over to you but I have sent
9:30
this to you in an email directly so check your emails to make sure that you have it the first element that I fill
9:36
out when I'm looking at act 1 and I'm going to be kind of referring to this as we go is the opening scene or hook so
9:44
this is just this is not like the biggest event this is not like the big battle or anything like this this is
9:52
just where do we see your character in the opening scene how are we going to meet your character for the very first
9:57
time what I always try to think of is what is going to be an opening scene that is going to absolutely hook the
10:04
reader make them care about my character right from the start make them get some sense of what this story is going to be
10:10
like is it a mystery is it a comedy is it a romance give that really good
10:16
picture of what your character is like right now I always try to think about this in terms of what is going to make
10:22
the reader immediately at the end of that first chapter even the first page think okay I've got to read this book
10:28
doesn't mean it needs to be some huge explosion it can just be like a hint of a mystery what is that first image like
10:35
if this was a movie opening up what do you want them to see at the very beginning and why is it important spend
10:41
some time really thinking about why this is the beginning of your book and why it sets up the story so well if you can
10:47
give a hint of what trouble or what challenge is going to face this character throughout the book that's how
10:53
you're gonna hook them so the next thing that I like to fill out is the setting of the story so I was just talking about
10:59
the tone matching the genre so now we're going to think about the setting of the story where is it set and what is
11:06
place look like what's the feel you're going for is it a small town is it an you know an urban setting are we in a
11:13
big city where there's a lot of high-rise are we in a dystopian future what is the story world then I like to
11:21
fill out who are the allies of this story who is on your heroines team so
11:26
James Scott Belle likes to call this the care package sometimes so like who cares about your character and who does your
11:31
character care about now what I like to do is I like to put all of the characters allies right here in this act
11:37
one section even if I don't meet them until later and if I have a character
11:43
that I'm like oh okay well Marion is gonna be an ally to her but she won't meet Mary Ann until act 2 then I'll just
11:49
make a little note of that but I like to go ahead and have a list here of all the main characters that are going to be my
11:54
heroine or here as allies throughout the story next is the dramatic question you
12:00
should be able to answer the dramatic question with a simple yes or no so it should be something like will Harper
12:06
survive will Harper get sent to juvenile detention yes or no will Mariah be able
12:12
to find out what really happened that night yes or no there's usually some
12:18
kind of dramatic question that you will ask here in the first act and the point
12:24
of the whole story will be to answer that question with a yes or no answer the way I like to think about the
12:29
dramatic question is it is the entire central conflict of your story and it
12:36
usually has to do with the stakes and what your character is up against so then you've got the argument against
12:42
transformation and this is another terminology from james-scott Belle's book superstructure so I highly
12:49
recommend you get it and read it because it is for me it was life-changing in terms of plotting when we talk about the
12:56
argument of transfer against transformation basically your character at the beginning is going to be asked to
13:03
change in some way and we need to see like where that character is at the beginning of the story and then once you
13:11
know remember how in the character arc thing I say here's the beginning here's where they are in the middle and then
13:16
here's where they are at the end so once you know where your character is going to transform into by the end of
13:22
the story you can sort of set that up here in act 1 this can be a very powerful thing when it comes to stating
13:29
sort of the theme of the book and how your character is going to transform by the end just if you think okay this is
13:36
this person is going to transform into someone who loves and accepts themselves by the end then an Act one we need to
13:42
have them argue against why they're never going to change because James Scott Bell really introduces the
13:48
argument against transformation well and what he actually says is this is kind of
13:54
your character telling you why they shouldn't be the hero of this story and I loved it when he said that because
14:00
it's like your character is saying well I don't deserve to be this person I'm never going to be a hero or a heroine
14:06
and I'm just going to forget what happened to me and I'm going to move on thank you very much but the truth is
14:13
they are going to get pulled into the story whether they like it or not sometimes people call this the refusal
14:18
of the call so you your heroine or hero might get a call to an adventure in the
14:23
first act like they might be there might be enticed to join the story in some bigger way so for example I've heard
14:30
this said so many times like Star Wars Luke Skywalker gets this call to
14:35
adventure like help me obi-wan Kenobi and you know Princess Leia has this
14:40
chance to go save her and he's like I'm not doing that so he refuses the call at first and then later he gets pulled into
14:46
the story because his family is killed and he now he's he's in it for the long
14:52
haul so refusal of the call can also happen at the same time as the argument against
14:57
transformation okay then what we've have in my story sheet is we're going to meet the antagonist or get introduced to the
15:05
mystery in some way so in some stories you actually know who the antagonist is you know who the bad guy is so to speak
15:13
who is causing the conflict for your hero or heroine and sometimes you don't actually know who it is or what it is
15:20
that is the antagonist but you do know that there's some kind of mystery going on here so that is what happens in deep
15:26
dark secrets as I'll show you in a little bit but you do want to go ahead and introduce the mystery of the story
15:32
or the tagging is one thing to keep in mind if you're writing a romance is that sometimes the antagonist of the story is
15:38
your hero or your heroine the antagonist your hero's antagonist might be the heroine because they don't want to fall
15:45
in love and so that heroine is what's threatening their way of life and that's the way romances often are is the
15:50
antagonist is actually the hero or heroine of the story then this next part
15:56
is crucial you need to be introducing the stakes of the story what happens if Harper fails what
16:03
happens if the evil wins at the end of this what happens if we never find out the truth of what happened to Mariah
16:09
what happens if the heroine can't come through with this loan does she lose the
16:14
farm whatever it is what are the stakes what is at stake sometimes it can be
16:19
something very small or something very local like it can be literally losing
16:25
your family farm which is not small to that person but it doesn't really affect the world at large
16:30
but it affects this person's world and sometimes it can be much more global so it's like you know you'll see this in
16:36
some of the bigger like action-adventure movies or even in big epic fantasy movies like Lord of the Rings
16:42
what happens if Frodo does not get the ring to the mountain or whatever I don't know what it's called but what happens
16:48
if Frodo fails if they fail to get destroy the ring the world ends and evil takes over forever you know it can be
16:54
something small like losing the family farm or if she doesn't understand who she truly is and fall in love then
17:02
she'll never find happiness so it can be like sort of like a death of your happiness or it can be the death of the
17:08
world and something much bigger but you need to decide for yourself what are the stakes of this story what's at stake for
17:13
your heroine what's at stake for the larger community around them and then finally what we have at the very end of
17:19
act 1 for the act 1 climax is we have the first doorway of no return the first
17:24
doorway of no return is basically also called sometimes the first plot point this is the first big event where your
17:32
character gets locked into the action of the story what is it that happens that
17:37
makes your character go on the journey they are going to go on throughout this adventure what you can also think is
17:44
what is the confrontation or afflict that is going to carry us through act 2 and to the rest of this
17:50
book is it a mystery was there a murder and now your heroine is being accused of
17:55
it for Harry Potter for example the end of act 1 is that all these envelopes finally start coming and
18:03
he has no choice now I mean he's going to Hogwarts whether the Dursleys liked
18:08
it or not that's an event that locks him into the story that first doorway is
18:13
something where your character is going to make a decision or something that will happen to them that now locks them
18:20
into your story's action this is also sort of a passage like life will never
18:25
be the same again so what happens to your character what decision do they make or what event do they go through
18:31
that changes their life forever a decision to go to a school for wizards or witches is definitely a life changing
18:38
the decision to explore murder mystery is definitely a life changing decision if you really think about it this is
18:46
your character saying okay I'm going to face this conflict I'm going to actively
18:52
become a participant in this story because of something that's happened and
18:57
pulled me in and now I am locked into this stakes right the stakes of the
19:04
story and if I fail there's death of some kind now the death could be like I
19:10
said figurative like if I lose my family's farm I will be ashamed of myself forever and I will never be able
19:16
to find happiness again or it could be literal like if I go in
19:22
search of Princess Leia and I fail at this you know I could literally die so
19:29
one way or another your character is now locked into these stakes and they're facing some kind of death in one way or
19:36
another in KM Wyland's book structuring your novel she has a really really great explanation of what she calls the
19:44
inciting event versus the key event now I am NOT going to be able to describe
19:49
this as well as she does but I hope that you will read that because it's really really great explanation but basically
19:56
the inciting incident or the sighting event is something that happens earlier before the climax of act one
20:03
that introduces the new story world or the mystery to your character but the key event is the thing that locks them
20:10
into the story for good so I will explain how this makes sense to me when it comes to one of my own stories but
20:17
she has some great explanations of it one of the great ways that I love that she explains this is she says like the
20:23
inciting event is what gets the story moving so if you're thinking about dominoes it's that first domino that
20:29
tips over then what she says as the key event is the event like the insight if
20:36
the inciting event is the beginning of the story it tips over that first domino and kind of is the first effect you know
20:43
that has on your character then the key event is the thing that solidifies your
20:49
character being locked into this story forever so she doesn't give this example
20:54
but since I was talking about Star Wars you know the inciting event I could be wrong about this but what I would say is
21:00
the inciting event for Luke Skywalker is destroyed that he gets this message from
21:07
Princess Leia that's an inciting event no he says okay I don't want anything to do with it but he's already connected to this because
21:14
he was because of the day he was born so all those things kind of happen earlier but the key event for him is
21:21
when his family is murdered and he has no choice now but to leave and follow
21:26
this adventure then he's locked into the story hopefully that makes some sense and I'll explain it a little bit more as
21:32
we dive into the actual plotting of my story there are more things that happen
21:38
and there's so much more that I could go into that's why I highly encourage you read you to read these books that I've
21:44
kind of talked about because they go so much more in detail than what I can do in a single video but hopefully this
21:49
gives you a good overview and now I'll take you through how I would use this in my own plotting and give you kind of an
21:55
example but basically you want to set up the story and you want to set up the
22:00
stakes of the story and then you want to have those major events that key event is one of the biggest things because
22:07
it's what locks your character into the story and then the doorway of no turn is what decision your character
22:14
makes so for Luke Skywalker for example the key event is his family is murdered
22:20
his doorway happens at the same scene basically when he says okay I'm in I'm
22:26
going on this adventure and I'm with you no longer gonna refuse this call I'm in it so the event happens to him and in
22:33
the doorway he makes the decision to go through that doorway and I've heard it explained many many times that really
22:38
the best doorways and the best way to do a doorway of no return are into the new world has to be an action that your
22:45
character decides to take so they're a willing participant in this and I'll show you how that applies in my own
22:51
story as well alright so let's move on to my example of deep dark secrets I am
22:57
so excited to introduce you guys to deep dark secrets which is book 1 of my spirit walkers trilogy I'm going to take
23:04
you through how I would have filled this out for that book for example so the opening scene is a very short prologue
23:12
that sets up the main inciting event of this story right from the beginning
23:18
which is that there was an accident where my heroine Mariah's best friend
23:23
Haley was driving and she was acting very strange and all of a sudden she starts going
23:30
very fast and Mariah sees these black tears running down her friend's face which introduces and sets up this
23:37
paranormal or supernatural genre and introduces that this is a mystery
23:42
because we don't know why this girl would do such a thing because this is her best friend acting completely out of
23:48
character then after that very short prologue we moved to one year later in the present where my main character is
23:55
checking out of rehab and the hook here is you know is this character crazy or
24:00
not because her memories are very unreliable and no one believes her so
24:07
we're setting that up right from the beginning and also setting up a situation where the reader can feel
24:13
sympathy toward my main character because you know not only has her best friend died under mysterious
24:19
circumstances but now everyone thinks that Mariah doing drugs with her friend and they
24:27
blame her kind of for the accident so it sets up that sympathy as well as the hook now moving on to the setting so I
24:33
would potentially go into more detail in the setting that I do in this example but I did just write out the places that
24:41
we get familiar with in this book so you've got the Longview Rehabilitation Center which is the mental institution
24:47
she's in the very beginning then we have the small town of Twin Rivers where Mariah lives it's the fictional town in
24:54
the mountains of North Carolina there are lots of hiking trails woods mountains waterfalls rivers that kind of
25:02
thing so setting up that type of town then I
25:07
also set some of the story at Twin Rivers high school I could also have added that some of it happens at her
25:14
house and I could have gone into a description of what Mariah's house looks like what the high school looks like you
25:20
can just choose how much of the setting you want to get detailed on in this plotting sheet and you could add just
25:25
another set of notes if you want to get more detailed Mariah's allies in the
25:30
story at the beginning are dr. Milner which is her psychologist at Longview
25:35
rehabilitation center and also we are introduced to her sister Kimmy I put a
25:40
little smiley face there because she's one of my favorite characters in this story she is petite but has similar
25:48
looks Mariah and she's a little bit younger than Mariah then we have Jordin
25:54
gray cloud who is a Native American he is good looking he is new to town and
26:00
tall mysterious has dark hair skin and he is
26:05
you know really this is not only an ally but the love interest of the story and I
26:11
should have actually added in here that her friend her only friend that has still remained her friend throughout
26:17
this whole time is a girl named Nicole and I should have added this here in a lies but I forgot to add it in so she
26:24
would go into the allies section as well the dramatic question like I said this
26:29
is the story question is will Mariah find out the truth of what
26:35
and that night or I could also word it as was Haley murdered so we need to know
26:44
by the end of this story what truly happened or at least will Mariah ever find out the truth of what happened
26:51
you could also say the dramatic question is are Mariah's memories reliable so you
26:58
could come up with any way to address the central conflict but it's all based around that same conflict of what
27:04
actually happened to that night and will Mariah ever find out then we move on to
27:09
the argument against transformation so for Mariah since we filled out that
27:15
inner goal motivation and conflict and that sort of thing with her earlier you
27:22
know that her argument against transformation is I'm fine I just want to leave it all behind me now it's time
27:28
for me to move on and focus on the future that's what she keeps saying to
27:34
people and even to her parents and to her therapist that she's like you know I
27:39
am ready to leave this rehabilitation center I'm ready to leave this path behind me but this is really just armor
27:47
because she's actually not truly ready she really does deep down want to know what happened but she's afraid so that's
27:54
why she makes this argument against transformation and then we have the meet the antagonist or introducing of the
28:02
mystery now in this story we do not know who the antagonist is until the very end
28:07
because it is a mystery so we don't find out the true antagonist until the end of the story but I do introduce a lot of
28:15
mysterious elements so right away the mystery is introduced with what really happened that night
28:20
why did Haley have these black tears running down her face and why would Haley purposely drive them off the
28:27
bridge there also becomes an introduction of through dream sequences of a stranger in
28:34
the river a new strange guy that she remembers as well as a medallion that he
28:39
gave her that night and everyone says that this guy did not exist but now someone who
28:45
has just enrolled at her high school looks so much like the guy she remembers so that introduces another hook of a
28:52
mystery it's like all ties in to her dreams here and what really happened
28:58
that night so it's like who here's a clue that maybe she is remembering it correctly but if she is then who is this
29:04
the serious guy and is Jordan Gregg out loud the guy that was there that night what did he have to do with the whole
29:10
thing then I introduce or set up the stakes of the story so I would say in
29:17
the deep dark secrets the stakes of the stories if she doesn't figure out the truth she'll never trust herself again
29:23
she will be broken for ever she already feels that she's broken in the eyes of
29:30
her parents but she doesn't even trust herself so if she doesn't go through
29:35
this path or go down this path and figure out what really happened that night she can't ever trust herself again which will be a type of death because
29:41
she will never truly love herself or believe in herself also there are now
29:47
strange symbols and nightmares that point to you know possible antagonists
29:52
besides just an accident and she has to start wondering is she next is this
29:58
going to affect her in some way so start to introduce more of darker stakes for
30:06
herself then we move into the first doorway of no return so before we can
30:12
address that we need to look at the inciting event so for this particular story the inciting event is the accident
30:20
that happened one year ago that is the first domino that tipped over was this crazy accident that nobody understands
30:26
the key event however that locks Mariah into the story is that at the end
30:31
of Act one she finds a note in her locker from her dead friend Haley this
30:38
note basically says if anything happens to me it wasn't an accident and for
30:44
Mariah this thing where she's been trying to deny her memories and go with
30:51
the flow and believe that what everyone else said is true and you know fit in she just can't do that anymore
30:58
now she has proof that this was not an accident and so her reaction to that is
31:04
the first doorway which is where Mariah decides to find out the truth and she
31:10
begins her own journey to investigate what really happened to that night her
31:15
commitment to investigate is the doorway so hopefully that makes sense that the
31:21
inciting event the first domino that tipped over was the actual accident the beginning of the mystery the key event
31:27
for Mariah is when she finds that note in her locker she can no longer refuse
31:33
the call to adventure she says okay this was not an accident so her reaction to it is the first
31:39
doorway of no return which is her decision to find out what really
31:44
happened so here we have a filled out story grid for act 1 now what I'll do
31:51
briefly is later on in your plotting notebook you have this little grid here
31:56
so this is just four sections and what I like to do is I will label the first one
32:01
as act 1 and I will start filling it out with some of the scenes that I now know
32:06
need to happen based on how I just filled this out so for example I know
32:12
that the very beginning or opening scene is going to be the accident and then I
32:19
know that the scene after that is going to be Mariah checking out of rehab so I
32:24
could go ahead and write those scenes down now if I wanted to if you don't want to use this story grid you could
32:31
also pull out index cards and write each one of these scenes on index cards so
32:37
even though you filled out this original thing like everything that's happening in act 1 you may not have all of the
32:44
scenes filled out yet but don't worry because we are going to address that as well when we get to the bringing it all
32:50
together video that will come at the end after we've gone through all the acts and I'm going to show you how I figure out what the actual scenes are but what
32:58
I like to do is go ahead and start filling in some of the scenes that I know once I've gotten the act 1
33:05
structure down and that gives me sort of a starting point when I start to fill
33:11
out the action scenes so hopefully that is a good example for you if you have any
33:16
questions make sure to pop them down below and I will answer them as soon as
33:21
I can alright guys you made it through to the end of Act one I sincerely hope
33:27
that this has given you some ideas many of these ideas might not even be new to you but I know that for me it helps to
33:32
see how other people apply them to your stories which is why I've taken the time to go through one of my own just to give
33:39
you an example of how I would fill it out for myself and maybe that'll trigger some ideas for you as well so in our
33:46
next video we're going to move on to Act two part one and I separate act two into
33:53
Part one and Part two because it is really the longest part of your story so we're just going to tackle Act two part
34:01
one in my next video and that will be coming out a week from today so I hope that you are subscribed to my channel
34:06
make sure that you hit that notification bell so that you get notified as soon as a new video goes up from me and again if
34:13
you have not yet downloaded your free plotting workbook head over to heart breathing's calm slash plot your novel
34:19
and download that today I will also pop that link for you down in the description box below and that is it for
34:26
today guys thank you so much for sticking through this I know this is gonna be a long video thirty minutes plus but hopefully I have been a pretty
34:34
thorough here and giving you some good ideas on how to plot your own novel on how to get started that's it for today
34:39
and I will see you in my next video bye [Music]
hello and welcome back to heart breathings i'm so excited to be back and sharing with you some of my best
0:06
ideas or what i would say are the best practices to follow when you're planning writing and
0:12
actually publishing your series so i'm going to give you 10 tips today and some of them will be about the
0:17
writing of it and then some of them will be about the packaging and actually marketing and selling of your books so
0:24
let's get started
0:29
okay so we're going to go over 10 things that i would call best practices when you're going to be
0:35
planning and writing and publishing your series so these are things that come from my
0:42
personal experience as well as talking just like so many conversations with
0:47
fellow authors who have been in this industry for a long time and the knowledge that i've gotten from
0:53
them the experience i've had on my own but i will preface these 10 things by saying
0:58
you can do it your way that's one of the most amazing things about being a creative person and putting your work
1:04
out into the world and especially as indie authors when you're self-publishing you get to choose so if any one of these
1:11
things is like well that one's not for me then fine don't do it and that's great it's either going to
1:16
work for you or it's not going to work there is no like one size fits all this
1:21
is how you write a series this is how you make a million dollars that's going to work for everyone in the end you have to follow your own heart
1:28
trust your own experience and do what feels right to you but i would like to share with you 10
1:34
things that i feel would be helpful for almost everybody who's writing a series and
1:40
wants to publish it and find an audience or you know develop a community or make some money out of your writing so
1:46
hopefully these things will resonate with you i realized as i was outlining it that i could probably do
1:52
full length videos on each one of these 10 points so i'm going to instead have to keep it
1:57
brief and just briefly discuss each one of these in bullet points but in the future if there are any of these
2:04
videos you'd like to see in more detail or you're going to get a chance also to ask some q a
2:09
please just let me know what you'd like to hear more about from my experience and i will definitely elaborate on that
2:15
so these 10 aren't in any particular order except for the fact that in the beginning i tried to keep it toward the writing side
2:21
and the second half is publishing but this isn't like any order of importance so here we go number one be consistent
Be Consistent
2:28
and this actually applies to your entire career the more consistent you are in
2:35
the genre that you're publishing in the way you speak to your fans in how often you publish in your branding
2:41
in the way that you show up in the quality of your writing hopefully consistently getting better over time
2:48
the more consistent you are the better off your whole career is going to go if you write you know three books in one
2:56
y a genre and they come out you know boom boom boom one two three and you put them all into kindle unlimited and
3:02
you're exclusive there and then you don't write a book for two years and then you come out with an
3:07
epic fantasy that takes a year to write each book and it's you know a totally different
3:13
price point completely different voice it's got a lot of you know cuss words or sex in it whereas your other book didn't and then
3:19
you disappear for another five years and you come back and you're writing cozy mystery you're probably going to have some
3:26
struggles when it comes to building an audience because while there are a lot of readers out there that will read across multiple
3:32
genres it's so much easier to build your initial fan base when you're writing one single
3:38
genre and you have kind of one single brand and in addition to that the more consistent you
3:45
are with the way you publish and the way you write the better off you're going to be so i
3:50
shared this in my video about my biggest mistakes that sometimes i would change the pov
3:56
style or i would change the types of covers or the way i presented my story or i was writing this genre and
4:03
then switch to another and i feel like these things even though i wouldn't call them regrets
4:08
are definitely some of the biggest things that have held me back in my own publishing career if i had been more
4:14
consistent with putting out releases closer together keeping it to a single series
4:20
making sure that if i had harper's point of view it was harper's point of view through the whole series and just being
4:25
more consistent in all of those areas cover art how often i publish the way
4:30
that i write the types of pov the genre that i'm writing if i had stayed consistent with all of those
4:36
things and even consistent in communication with my email group with my facebook group consistent with
4:42
that sort of thing i know that it would have been so much better there are going to be times in your career when you just
4:49
can't be consistent you have a death in the family or there are other things that get in the way
4:54
but this is why you should kind of plan ahead if you can for those sorts of situations when i got myself
5:01
into a situation where i'm writing five or six series all at once and something bad happens with my health
5:06
it becomes very difficult for me to stay consistent in any way whereas if i had just been writing a
5:11
single series and i had had to take a few months off it wouldn't have had that big of an impact so the more consistent you can be and
5:19
consistent like in your planning for the future the better off you're going to be for your entire
5:25
career number two and this again goes for both the writing and the publishing but i'm focusing more on the writing
5:31
here is continue to learn i've talked about this in the past but it is so incredibly
Continue To Learn
5:36
important we all start out knowing almost nothing about how to write a novel except maybe
5:43
intuitively we have read enough or consumed enough stories that we get an idea of how a story is told
5:49
i have recently been reading some of my very first novels over on my other youtube channel which is just
5:55
slash sarah cannon i'll link it for you down below and as i was reading my very first book out loud beautiful demons i was just
6:02
groaning some in the inside thinking oh my gosh all these mistakes all these things i didn't know
6:08
about how to tell a story now that story has still been incredibly successful and well loved
6:14
however i have continued to grow in my talent and skill not just because i have experience
6:21
writing more novels but also because i have continued to seek out books on craft i actually just
6:26
recently bought like 10 new books on how to write better so i'm going to be covering those here on this
6:32
youtube channel so make sure you're subscribed but i'm constantly trying to learn more about how to be a better writer
6:38
and the three best ways that i learn are number one by continuing to write and practice my
6:44
own craft number two by reading books and watching youtube videos and consuming resources
6:51
from other people who know better than me and number three by continuing to read
6:56
books by really great authors and i learned so much just by consuming stories and this doesn't even just mean books i
7:03
also learn a lot about how to tell a great story by watching you know the avengers or by watching
7:09
certain television series that really grip you and trying to analyze what is it about this story that i love
7:15
so much and what did the author do and the more you analyze what other writers do the more you learn to
7:21
so continuing to learn more about how to tell a great story is always going to be important and it
7:28
will serve you well because even if you've written 30 50 75 books
7:33
there's always a next level there's no writer in the world who has just hit perfection and can never improve we
7:39
can always improve so continue to learn on the flip side that also is true
7:44
for actually self-publishing you can take a course on self-publishing you can learn everything there is to know about
7:50
facebook ads and all of that there's always going to be a next level there's always going to be a tactic or a
7:55
strategy you haven't tried there's always going to be somebody that's doing something innovative that you can learn from and say oh my
8:02
gosh look at what they're doing maybe i could try that too so keeping an open mind and just continuing to
8:09
put on your student hat and be open to learning more about how to be a better writer how to market your books better
8:16
and how to get your books out in the world better how to do social media better how to do better newsletter lists and all of
8:22
that just be a lifelong learner when it comes to your writing career and that is really going to serve you
8:28
well you never are going to hit a point where it's like well i'm the best and i never need to learn anything else
8:34
because that would just mean that you'll fail to grow anymore in the future number three know your readers
Know Your Readers
8:41
this is another place where you can really continue to grow and learn the more you know about the
8:48
type of person who is really going to love your book and latch onto it and become a fan for
8:53
life the better off you're going to be now a lot of times what we see
8:59
when we think about our readers our future readers is we see ourselves because we think i'm writing the story i
9:05
wish someone else had written i'm writing the story that i love and that i want to put onto the world so
9:10
that is a great place to start in my publishing course we call this the ideal reader avatar which is kind of a
9:16
play on a standard marketing idea of an ideal customer avatar so think about who is your ideal
9:23
reader it could be you or it could just be a reader that you can imagine that loves
9:30
your type of books but the more you can learn about that reader what types of tv shows they like
9:35
what types of things they have around their house how many kids they have or if they're single or if they're student
9:41
if you can really kind of get an idea of who that reader is and that picture
9:46
then you're going to be able to market your books to that reader better but you're also going to be able to tailor your series to that reader better
9:54
one of the mistakes that i see a lot of people making when they're getting started out in their writing
9:59
is they say well i like everything i like writing and reading
10:05
science fiction and fantasy and dystopian and mystery and all of that so i'm writing a book or i'm writing a
10:12
series that doesn't really fit anywhere because i'm like putting all of these things in there kind of like everything but the kitchen
10:18
sink which in some ways i hate to criticize that because like i said it's
10:24
there are no rules it's either works or doesn't work but when it comes to actually putting your
10:30
book out into the world and putting it up on amazon or apple books or google play and asking other people to read it readers
10:37
want to know where does it fit so let's say that you're walking through
10:42
a barnes noble bookstore and you see a book that is just sitting on the floor when
10:48
you pick it up and you turn it over and you read the back cover blurb and you see the cover for that book
10:54
you should be able to as a lifelong reader know where that book kind of fits in the
10:59
store it's possible that it's going to fit in a couple of different places like sure you could fit
11:04
it in fiction and literature but you could also fit it very easily in mysteries because you can tell from that
11:10
cover with a like broke down pickup truck on an old country road and the red you know drawing in the
11:16
background or whatever that this belongs in the mystery section or maybe it has a couple in historical
11:24
dress on the cover with a flourishing brand to the title and in the back it talks about how these two people are
11:30
going to find love it's very obvious that this fits in the romance section if a reader were to walk into a
11:36
bookstore and pick up a cover with an ambiguous image on the front and the back cover blurb
11:42
is like there's mystery there's suspense there's an alien ship and there's an you know a dystopian
11:47
factor to this and there's it's just this hodgepodge that reader is probably going to feel overwhelmed
11:53
they're not going to really know where it fits and in their mind they're not going to be able to say oh this is kind of like
11:58
that other thing that i liked and chances are that reader is going to go i don't know what kind of book this is
12:05
and they're just going to set it right back down on the floor or the nearest table readers like to be able to categorize
12:12
things and while your book or your series may have elements from multiple genres
12:17
it's so important as you're writing it that you begin to understand very clearly
12:22
where your book fits into a bookstore and if you can't do that if you can't
12:28
point to any other series or any other type of you know fiction or anything like that that is similar to yours
12:35
in any way like there's nothing in the world like yours it's very possible that you're gonna
12:40
have a hard time marketing that book or that series it's great for your series or your style of writing to
12:47
be unique but i also want to warn you that the harder it is to identify what type of reader is going
12:55
to like your book or what other things your ideal reader also enjoys
13:01
the harder it's going to be for you to market your books and to get them into the hands of the right readers you need to have a clear and
13:08
identifiable genre even if it's a genre match up to some degree you need to decide where this fits then
13:15
you need to understand on an intimate level what readers of that primary genre come
13:21
to expect from those types of books so if you were writing let's say a mystery series it is going to be so
13:29
important for you to understand what type of mystery what type of niche mystery you're writing is it a psychological thriller
13:35
is it a domestic thriller is it a twisty-turny kind of horror mystery is it a detective police
13:42
procedural is it a cozy mystery and if you don't have any idea what those different types
13:48
of sub-genres or niches are all about then as you're writing you need to figure that out
13:53
if you want to be able to sell your books this is incredibly important and i cannot stress it enough that you really come to understand what
14:01
type of book it is you're writing and what readers in that genre come to expect
14:06
so when i say know your readers i'm talking about know what they like know what they come
14:12
to expect and be able to turn it around and say if i was looking at my book in a bookstore
14:19
what type of reader would pick it up and if they had to go and shelve it in the bookstore or the library where would
14:24
they put it so if you can go ahead and be thinking on that level as you're actually writing the book and writing the series
14:30
you're going to be way ahead of the game when it comes to marketing your series and publishing it later
14:35
number four is also a difficult one and this goes back to consistency which many of these will
14:41
which is to focus in on a single genre or series in the beginning i mentioned this before
Consistency
14:48
because this is not something that i have been able to do since kind of after my first series but i do
14:54
feel like one of the biggest things that got me started and is why i became as successful as i was right from the start
15:01
is because i had a single series that was very clearly branded very easy to identify where it belonged
15:07
in you know the bookshelves so to speak and i published only in that one series
15:12
for six full books before i switched genres or anything like that i was super consistent and that jump started my
15:19
whole career if you love writing in multiple genres multiple pen names multiple
15:24
series all that kind of stuff feel free to play and do whatever your creative muse wants to do
15:30
but when it comes to your publishing plan for that series it's so important to start with a single
15:36
series a single pin name a single strategy until you start to gain traction
15:42
because if you popcorn all around this series this series this genre this you know pen name you're going to have a
15:49
difficult time managing it all and you may not be able to see that if you haven't started publishing yet you're thinking oh no i
15:55
know i can write this fast and i can do all these different things but once you start publishing it's going to be a whole new
16:01
ballgame because there's going to be a lot of marketing there's going to be websites and social media and ads and
16:06
all these other things that you need to learn and it becomes harder to find time to write so if you stretched yourself then
16:12
over multiple things you're not only asking yourself to stretch your attention but your creativity and that's just on
16:19
your level then when it comes to your readers you're not giving them that consistent series or consistent genre to really
16:26
latch onto and sort of dig their fingers into instead you're like making their head spin and you're just
16:33
not going to find success 90 of the time as fast as you would if you stuck to a single
16:38
genre a single pen name and even a single series i know this is really hard advice to
16:44
follow like i said i've had a hard time following this myself but this is where i'm headed in the future and i'm telling you do as i say
16:50
not as i do because this is super important and i did do it in the beginning and it really is what gave me a leg up
16:57
and has allowed me to have this amazing career ever since if i had not been so consistent in the
17:02
beginning with that one series i don't i wouldn't probably be where i am today
17:08
number five keep really good and detailed notes about your series and this is true for the writing and for
Detailed Notes
17:15
the publishing so i have an entire video if you missed it i will link it for you down below
17:20
on how to create a series bible i make mine inside a wiki but you can use one note
17:26
evernote scrivener you can just use word anything you need to use you can even use paper
17:32
binders keep detailed notes about everything that happens in your story world
17:37
because that is not only going to help you be number one tip consistent but it's also going to save
17:43
you so much time and energy as you write subsequent books in your series trust me on this the same is true for
17:50
when you're actually publishing your books keep detailed notes about what keywords you tried what categories you went into
17:57
what are your blurbs what's your price point and then as you switch and change because your covers
18:02
might change you might try different keywords you might try a different type of marketing strategy
18:07
keep detailed notes about what you've done which version of your book is currently uploaded what your back matter is
18:14
keep track of all of your metadata if you're not sure what that is google it because it's super important
18:20
when you're keeping the details of your series not only inside your series world as you're writing it but also as you're publishing
18:26
it just be as detailed as you can i highly recommend keeping detailed backups inside some kind of digital
18:33
program so that you don't lose them but it's just so important to keep track of stuff
18:38
because as much as you might think one or two books in that you're doing a great job keeping track of it now
18:44
it's going to start to grow and get a little bit more and more overwhelming as time goes on
18:49
because there's just going to be a lot to keep track of including once you start publishing your sales numbers and
18:55
everything else so keep detailed records number six also goes back to that idea of
19:01
consistency when you're publishing your series have consistent
Consistent Branding
19:06
branding what i mean by branding is the messaging and the imagery around your series for
19:14
example my shadow demon saga you can see a couple of the books here three of the books here they all look like a set they have the
19:20
same cover model on the front my name isn't exactly the same font and the same location and makeup
19:26
at the top the title of the book is in the same font with the same type of flourish and spacing
19:32
every single time on the on the bottom of the book and it just looks consistent so if you were to see
19:37
these on the amazon store or the apple store your eye would be able to immediately go
19:42
to it and be like oh that's a sarah cannon book because on all my paranormal books like this my name looks exactly the same and
19:49
it's always at the top and it's just right there for you to see so it's easy to see that these books belong together
19:56
the titles i also branded really nicely so you've got beautiful demons inner demons bitter demons shadow demons
20:02
and readers may not remember shadow versus rival and which one was book before and which one was book five
20:08
but they remember that it has that demons to it and so whenever they see that on a subconscious level their eyes
20:14
begin to recognize that these books go together it's also branded really clearly as a young adult series
20:21
so you can look at it and you can easily tell oh this is magical because there's magical flourishes
20:27
this is a little bit mysterious and you can tell the mystery on the covers this is something that's obviously young
20:33
adult because we've got a young girl and it's just branded that way so your branding is extremely important
20:40
and you can take it up a notch if you want so not just branding your series to itself
20:46
but also branding your social media and your author website and your logo
20:51
to your genre basically and this is one of those ways that consistency can play
20:57
a role when it comes to all of these things kind of working in synergy because you could have
21:03
a beautiful logo that uses the same font that you use on your book for your name you can have a website
21:09
that uses similar colors so that everything looks good together and when someone visits your website
21:15
they can tell oh this is a young adult author and i can see her book covers and they all look well together
21:20
and the types of things i talk about on my blog are almost always related to young adult paranormal
21:26
witches ghosts or to my writing life as an author tarot cards spells all of those kind of
21:32
things so everything is very tightly branded toward the type of books i write and the type
21:38
of things that i know my readers will enjoy so the better and more consistent you can be
21:44
with your branding across each individual book but also your entire author career
21:49
the better off you're going to be when it comes to attracting the right type of readers number seven
Publish Consistently
21:55
publish as consistently and as frequently as possible
22:00
this is one that has so much that i could say about it i do have a previous video on my thoughts
22:07
about rapid releasing which is when you release a book like every month or every six weeks so i will
22:13
link that for you down below as well but my general advice is to publish
22:19
as frequently as you can with your very best foot forward so i don't recommend
22:25
to anyone to just put books out as fast as possible if you know they're gonna gonna be below what your quality of
22:32
writing is so stick to your personal standards in terms of how fast you can write a really great book and get it
22:38
produced but try to do it as quickly and consistently as possible writers especially in the indie space
22:45
are going to be all over the place when it comes to this some writers are only going to be able to put out one book a year but it's
22:51
going to be an amazing book hopefully if you spent the whole year working on it other writers you're going to see out there
22:57
they're going to be people who are putting out 20 books a year sometimes those books are ghost written
23:02
and those authors are just producing those books sometimes their books are maybe only 15 000 words and they're just putting out a
23:08
lot of books very quickly but sometimes it will actually be true that an author is just writing a book a month or
23:14
more than a book a month and this this is their genre and they're doing a great job with it most of us however
23:21
are going to write a little bit slower or maybe a lot slower than a book a month when it comes to
23:27
indie publishing however if there is any way that you can keep consistent enough to
23:32
put out a book every three to four months in your series you are going to be so much better off than someone who is putting
23:39
out a book once a year or once every two years i have watched the algorithms i watch what's
23:45
happening with other people's series when you start to put more than three to four months between
23:51
series releases you start to lose more fans than you would otherwise
23:56
and this is one of those harsh realities and i you know i'm sitting here staring in the face of two years since my previous book
24:04
in the shadow demon saga so the panic has started to set in and that has just been my life circumstances but i know
24:10
and i can see those numbers that as i wait two years i am losing
24:16
fans all the way around because there are just too many other things that fans can get invested in there's
24:21
more books there's other tv series there's games that they can play there's all kinds of stuff and we live in a very
24:28
instant gratification type of society where readers like to have that next thing you know netflix will
24:34
sometimes release an entire season all at once and people will binge watch it readers also love to binge read they
24:40
will however once they love your series they will wait for that next book but it's in your best interest not to
24:47
make them wait more than three or four months if you can help it now i say that obviously with a grain of
24:53
salt because i can't keep up that pace and i'm still a six figure a year author and it works
24:58
out fine but if you can at least in the very beginning put out your books pretty consistently
25:04
every three to four months even if that means you have to pre-write your books before you release them like
25:10
hold them back before you release them that three to four months is kind of a sweet spot when it comes to
25:17
it if you can go faster than three to four months that can actually really work great for you but be sure to check out
25:23
my video on rapid release because there are some downsides to rapid release that a lot of people don't address very often so
25:29
i'd love for you to get that full picture but if you can three to four months between series
25:36
releases now saying that if you're writing two series then that means you're gonna have to be
25:41
writing a book every month or two in order to keep up with both series so that's why i warn you about writing too
25:47
many series too many genres because if you really want to get your career off the ground
25:53
three to four months is kind of your sweet spot now if you're slower than that don't
25:58
panic you can still have a great career it just might take you really thinking through your strategy
26:03
maybe putting out some short stories and things like that if you're interested in hearing more about how to
26:10
get this kind of strategy going i highly recommend my publish and thrive course but if you were unable to afford it or
26:16
get in on this round come join us next year or if you have any requests about me discussing more about marketing
26:23
strategy put those in the comments down below and i'll see if i can come up with a video for you guys sometime in the near future so number
26:29
eight is to use a loss leader to attract more readers and actually to consistently
Use a Loss Leader
26:35
attract readers so a loss leader is basically just an entry product the beginning of your
26:42
series usually but that first thing that most readers are going to discover from you some people will call
26:48
this a reader magnet that draws readers in and gets them hooked on your series
26:54
the reason i call it a loss leader is because you're not going to be charging very much for this this is going to be a book that's either
27:00
free or 99 cents or whatever something that you're willing to lose money on to lead people
27:06
into your funnel or your series in general so if you choose to go wide meaning that
27:13
your books are going to be available at barnes noble and google and kobo and apple as well as amazon
27:19
then this is the hands-down best strategy that you could have for your series is to have a series of
27:26
at least five or six books with a loss leader entry place usually
27:32
for most types of series except those standalone series we talked about can you kind of have some leeway there
27:38
it's going to be the very first book in your series so for example i have a 10 book series with my shadow demon
27:44
saga people can't jump in because it's a dynamic series they can't jump in at book nine and
27:50
understand what's going on so my only option for a loss leader is book one of the series and actually
27:57
because i have such a long series i offer the first three books for free partially because
28:02
these three are shorter books they're only on the like 47 to 60 000 word range whereas my later books
28:10
are over a hundred thousand words so this gives them a really good taste of what's going on in the series and it
28:15
also gets them hooked in in those three books so i use three books as a loss leader and those
28:21
three free books make me so much more money than they ever could have at full price or 2 or 3.99 a piece
28:29
because so many more readers are willing to download a free book and give me a try
28:35
and then they get hooked so if you have that great first book use it as a loss
28:42
leader free works great i wouldn't set a book free until you've got several books behind it
28:48
because you only make the money and get the consistent readership and the loyal readership if they have more
28:53
to read but it's perfect to have once you start getting books published in your series
28:59
to have that entry point that is a loss leader now if you're in kindle unlimited this is
29:05
amazon's program where you are exclusive to amazon all the readers who have kindle unlimited
29:11
are going to be able to download your book for free anyway because they're in this subscription
29:16
model so it's not as important to see that book one as a lost leader but it is important to
29:23
know where your entry levels to your series are how are readers going to discover you and then use that as the basis
29:30
of your marketing like i said i could do a whole video on this just understand and i do actually have
29:36
an older video where i talk about loss leaders but just understand that as you begin to publish your series one of your very
29:42
best marketing tools is going to be whatever that entry book is i highly recommend that
29:48
your loss leader be something that is a full length novel not just a short story or a novella now when we
29:56
talk about cookies or you talk about something you're offering as a freebie for your mailing list that's a little bit
30:01
different but when it comes to the the number one entry point to your main series you're a
30:07
lost leader i highly recommend that it's a full-length novel that is not a seasonal
30:12
book so no christmas novellas as your main loss leader if you have a 10 book series that first
30:18
book needs to be a full-length novel that is putting your best foot forward
30:24
and it's not like a prequel to your main couple it's not a prequel to your main story it is the beginning of the story
30:30
because you want readers to download that first book at a lesser price or it free
30:36
and you want them to be hooked into your whole series so i didn't write a prequel thing to my
30:41
shadow demon saga and offer that for free i gave them the first three full books and by the time they finish the third
30:47
book if they're not hooked then it's just not for them but a lot of people are hooked
30:52
and i have tens of thousands of readers that have gone on to buy book for and continue on to read the rest of the
30:58
series and this is one of the strongest marketing tools and one of the best practices you will find especially if your books
31:05
are wide and number nine make it easy for your readers to buy your next book
Make It Easy For Your Readers
31:12
so in terms of best practices when you're selling your books make it as easy as possible for readers
31:20
to find out what you're working on next to find out where to buy your next book to find out how to buy your next book
31:27
how much it's going to cost what it's about so this means being active on social
31:32
media of some kind you don't have to be active on all the social medias but just make sure you have some kind of
31:38
platform for your author career where you're talking to your readers about what's coming next what you're
31:44
working on what you're excited about it can be facebook it can be instagram it can just be your own
31:50
blog but it's just so important to have some kind of author platform this also goes for having a website you
31:56
need to have an author website where you've got all your books listed links to all the
32:03
stores and all the places where your books are available so that when a reader goes looking for you let's say they pick up that lost
32:09
leader and they loved that first book you make it easy for them to head over to your website and see what other books
32:15
you have one click onto something and purchase it immediately if your reader has to google things and
32:21
go looking for where are her books available what else does she have reading and they can't find the answers
32:26
then you've got a problem so just to give you a quick example i was seeing this with my shadow demon
32:32
saga because like i told you i have short stories and side stories and spin-off things and i started to realize
32:38
that a lot of people had questions and they didn't understand that sacrifice me was a spin-off or that a
32:44
demon's wrath was jackson's story and so they didn't know what order to read it in and because they were just
32:50
slightly confused about how it all worked they weren't buying all the books they would just buy the books one through ten
32:56
and not read the side stories well what i did to fix that obviously was start talking about it more on
33:02
social media i put it into my facebook group and then i also put a tab on my web page that says reading order
33:10
and on that page people can find all of the short stories all the side stories the ideal reading order for how they
33:16
should consume it and immediately my sales went up and now anytime anyone asks about how do i read
33:22
this what other stories are involved there's an easy place to send them to to let them know
33:28
this also goes for having a newsletter list i don't know why so many authors resist
33:35
the idea of having a mailing list maybe because you don't want to like come into someone's inbox
33:40
and feel like you're advertising to them but it is extremely important and it's a must-have as part of your overall
33:46
author platform and brand to have some way to directly notify your readers
33:52
that the next book is out this book has a release date here's my cover art here's some fun things i'm
33:58
doing here's what i'm working on right now and you need to have it set up right when your first book goes live if not
34:04
before and if you can best practice have a link in the back and the front of your ebook
34:10
that says if you want to follow me more online make sure that you're signed up for my
34:16
newsletter list and you're following me there then keep up with those people i highly recommend a book called
34:22
newsletter ninja by tammy labreck i will link that for you down below because it is the definitive book about
34:28
author newsletters and why it is so very important so when it comes to your newsletter you can actually
34:34
link a sign up button on your facebook page you can have a link to sign up for your
34:39
newsletter on your instagram or other social media you should definitely have a link to sign up on your website but all of these things
34:47
are so important because they help it help make it so much easier for readers to find other books by you
34:54
and to continue to buy things from you so the easier you can make it for them
34:59
to one click buy your entire backlog or backlist of books the better this also goes for the actual
35:06
back matter of your book which is like once the the reader has hit the end what are those last few pages in your ebook
35:13
that say like hey if you loved this book you'll love book two in the series here's a link you'll want to learn how to optimize
35:20
your back matter to make sure that it's easy when a reader finishes that book and they're still on the high of oh my god that
35:27
cliffhanger or oh my gosh that was the sweetest love story ever or whatever feeling you left them with at the end of
35:33
the book you want them to turn that page and have a link immediately to buy another one of your books and if
35:38
this is the last book in the series then you definitely want that first link to be sign up for my newsletter
35:44
and get this free story that's the cookie we were talking about read tammy labreck's book or sign up for my
35:50
newsletter so you get an announcement as soon as the next book is out but you want to make sure that it's easy
35:55
for readers to find you online to understand where to buy your other books and make it as easy as possible
36:02
for them to buy the next book in your series if it's available all this stuff is so important and i
36:08
highly recommend if you're wide to actually put vendor specific links in the back of
36:15
your ebooks i'm only going to touch on this briefly but basically what i mean by that is
36:21
when you upload your book to apple books the link that says buy book 2 should be an
36:26
apple books link not a link back to your website where the reader has to go out of the ebook go to your website click on the link go
36:34
back to apple and then purchase the book it should be a link directly to that vendor
36:39
which means you're going to have to do a slightly separate file for amazon that sends readers back to
36:44
amazon a special file for google that sends readers back to google but it makes it easy and i would call
36:50
these vendor specific links in the back of your ebook you want to make it as easy as possible
36:56
i see a lot of authors that use universal links like books to read from draft to digital but i highly
37:02
recommend in the back of your book you just use that one click vendor specific link if you don't know
37:07
what i'm talking about don't worry about it but if you're at that point where you're already formatting your book just keep
37:12
that in mind as a best practices advice from me okay our final tip number
37:18
10 is stay true to yourself and i know that you're like that's not a
Stay True To Yourself
37:24
best practice i wanted a marketing tip but when it comes to your own happiness
37:29
and your own true success in this business this is not even tip number 10 this is tip
37:36
number one stay true to yourself you can hear advice from me you'll certainly hear
37:42
advice all over the internet from other people who have experience or who think they know what's best
37:49
and you will hear people that have all kinds of opinions and agendas
37:54
for what they believe about their own career including me but in the end you're the one who has to
38:01
live this life you're the one who's writing these books and putting your work out there in the way that makes the most sense to
38:08
you if you make a decision based on your own fear
38:13
or someone else's fear like for example a very popular thing to say right now to people is well you have to go into
38:20
kindle unlimited because the that's the only way you can make any money but that's just not true for everyone for some people kindle
38:27
unlimited which is amazon's exclusivity program makes a lot of sense because of the genre they're writing or how fast they
38:34
write or just the simple ease of it or whatever maybe that does align with you
38:39
but you shouldn't make the decision to go all in with kindle unlimited and put your
38:44
entire career in amazon's hands alone just because somebody told you that's the only way you're going to make money
38:50
you need to really look at the industry learn what's happening think long term
38:56
instead of just how do i make money as fast as possible stop and think what do i want my career
39:01
to look like long term do i really just want to be only at amazon and have them in control of my whole life
39:07
or am i doing that because somebody told me i should or am i doing that because i'm scared that it's the only way
39:13
you really need to look at the whole picture and look inside yourself and try to drown out that noise that
39:20
says do it this way do it this way and instead think what is right for me
39:26
what do i want long term what aligns with my personal values how do i want to
39:31
interact with readers because people can tell you you have to have a facebook group it's the only way everybody who's anybody is on facebook
39:38
but maybe you don't like facebook maybe it doesn't align with your values don't compromise your own
39:44
personal values just because somebody else told you this is the way you need to do it you could be just as successful with a
39:51
blog and an instagram account and never having a facebook page in your life so don't follow someone else's advice
39:57
when it just doesn't feel right to you some thunder here i don't know if you guys
40:02
heard that but god agrees with me so really i want to drive this home because
40:08
it is fundamental to your happiness and your joy there are a lot of things about putting
40:14
your work out there that are going to be very scary and because you feel vulnerable you're
40:19
also going to be vulnerable to other people's advice i know this from
40:25
very personal experience because i knew that i wanted to write these sort of why a mystery even college-age kind of
40:31
mystery horror y-a kind of paranormal things i had an idea of the type of thing that i
40:37
wanted to write very buffy the vampire slayer or buffy the vampire slayer the college years kind of stuff
40:44
but when i first started getting writing i had a whole group of people that said to me
40:50
that's never going to sell you're never gonna make a career out of that you really should be writing romance because it's easier to make money
40:56
writing romance so even though this was not true to who i am as a writer that's what
41:02
i started writing contemporary billionaire romance and there's nothing wrong with those books i love reading those books
41:08
but it's not aligned with who i am and i wasted two years of my life writing stuff that really wasn't what i
41:15
was meant to be writing because i was so scared and i was so vulnerable that i followed that advice
41:21
of this is the best way to make money but let me tell you right now if you hear nothing else from this video please hear
41:27
this making money is not going to make you happy it's going to help it's going to be so
41:32
exciting but in the end it's really about are you following your heart
41:38
are you doing what you were meant to do and what you were put on this earth to do if you have a story inside you that you
41:45
want to put out into the world write true to yourself stay true to your
41:50
own values and if somebody else is telling you this is the way you need to do it and blah blah blah blah you need to check in with yourself
41:58
take a deep breath take stock and think about your personal vision for the future what you really want your career to be
42:04
and then think does that align with that future or not and if not then it's okay to go your own
42:10
way and follow your own path you don't have to follow someone else's advice find someone else to take advice from
42:16
and even if that means you don't like my advice i'm okay with that just be true to yourself
42:24
and what you know is right i can promise you that following your heart even if you make mistakes along the way
42:30
which i readily admitted to you and spilled the tea on my own mistakes
42:35
you will be so much more happy and so much more fulfilled because you followed your
42:40
heart and you stayed true to yourself and that goes so much farther than you know another
42:48
zero in your bank account and i know that some of you will be like screw that i'm here for the money which
42:53
i totally understand that but i'm telling you right now that even though there are some people that will tell you
42:58
you have to do it this way to make money you can follow your own dreams follow your own path write the genre you
43:05
want if i had a dollar for everybody who told me you can't make money writing ya as an indie i would be a millionaire because there
43:12
are so many people that believe that and yet here i am having made over a million dollars writing y a
43:18
and that's because that's what i love to write and that's what i want to continue writing so i'm just here to tell you
43:24
that i'm living proof that you can follow your own dreams and you can make it happen for yourself so
43:31
figure out what you want what you want to write how you want to do it how you want to show
43:36
up in the world and then make it happen for yourself listen learn keep being consistent keep
43:43
trusting yourself and following your instincts and learning from your own mistakes and you're going to be fine because
43:49
there is no like do it this way and make money or you follow your dreams and fail you can follow your dreams and write what you
43:55
love and still make lots of money so it's not necessarily a choice it's just a matter of figuring out what aligns with your
44:02
personal values and going there so yeah number 10 stay true to yourself okay those are my

[Music]
45:38
you
okay so we're here today to talk about
0:03
why you need a self-publishing strategy
0:06
because you do you absolutely do so what
0:14
I mean first of all what I mean by
0:15
self-publishing strategy is you know
0:18
rather than deciding that you're just
0:20
gonna like upload a book and hope that
0:23
you're an instant millionaire I'm
0:25
talking about instead of that scenario
0:28
which is what surprising amount of
0:30
people do and think that it's gonna work
0:32
and very few people actually achieve you
0:38
come into this business with a set
0:40
strategy like you're gonna publish this
0:42
one series and it's gonna be five books
0:44
long and you're gonna try to have them
0:45
no more than three months apart
0:47
a strategy kind of like that that you're
0:49
going to you know publish an urban
0:51
fantasy and you're going to look at what
0:54
other kinds of books are selling you're
0:55
going to make sure that you fit into
0:56
that genre that you're writing
0:58
appropriate books for that genre and
0:59
you're going to brand your author name
1:02
and your website to be an urban fantasy
1:04
author those kind of strategies because
1:07
there are lots of things that you can do
1:09
to make your books rise above that don't
1:13
involve compromising yourself or
1:15
compromising your story it's just once
1:17
your story is done you're packaging it
1:19
in the best possible way you're
1:21
presenting it to the world in the best
1:23
possible way so that's what I mean by
1:25
strategy and here's why you need one
1:27
number one the number one reason why you
1:30
need a strategy is so that you don't
1:32
feel tempted to try everything all at
1:34
once so what I mean by that is you know
1:37
it can be very tempting to you know say
1:41
I I don't know where to spend my time so
1:44
I'm going to try everything I've heard
1:47
works I'm gonna get on Wattpad and try
1:50
some stories and build a following there
1:52
I'm gonna try some videos on YouTube and
1:54
see if that works I'm going to get into
1:56
these reader groups where they read a
1:58
lot of fan fiction I'm going to write
1:59
some fanfiction and see what happens
2:00
over there I'm gonna join a bunch of
2:02
author groups and see if I can make some
2:04
friends make some connection
2:06
I'm going to you know publish a young
2:08
adult book and then a mystery under this
2:10
pen name and a contemporary romance
2:11
under this pen name there is so much
2:13
that you can possibly like you might if
2:17
you go into an author group and you
2:18
start listening to what's the best way
2:19
to start my career there's going to be
2:22
just a mind-numbing amount of
2:26
information that is shared with you in
2:27
terms of what you could possibly do
2:30
because author over here is going to say
2:32
well here's what I did and this other
2:33
person is going to say well I did this
2:35
and we're very much in this day and age
2:38
of FOMO fear of missing out and I think
2:42
that the the biggest fear is that you're
2:45
going to go in one direction and it's
2:47
going to turn out to be the wrong
2:48
direction and you're gonna have wasted
2:50
time but what I'm telling you right now
2:52
is that nine times out of ten if not ten
2:56
times out of ten the best path is a
2:58
straight path where you decide this is
3:01
what I'm going to try and you're going
3:03
to focus a hundred percent on that
3:04
because if you say okay you know I'm
3:06
gonna try young-adult because that's
3:08
what I want to write and you go a
3:10
hundred percent young adult and you're
3:11
not like trying all this other stuff and
3:13
you say you know I'm gonna put my book
3:15
into Kindle unlimited and I'm gonna give
3:16
it a year and I'm gonna publish three
3:18
books and you have this very set
3:19
strategy you're gonna get a lot farther
3:21
in that one year than if you said I'm
3:24
gonna write one young adult one mystery
3:26
I'm gonna try can't you I'm gonna try to
3:27
go out of Kindle unlimited I'm gonna try
3:29
and you have like ten different things
3:31
and you're kind of just like throwing
3:32
spaghetti on the wall and hoping that
3:34
something sticks well instead of you
3:36
know if you do that you're honestly not
3:38
going to give anything enough attention
3:40
to even know if it works first of all
3:42
second of all you're gonna be so
3:44
scattered that you're gonna feel
3:46
overwhelmed you're not gonna know kind
3:48
of what's working and if something does
3:50
take off you might not even know what it
3:52
was that worked because you were trying
3:53
so many different things and you won't
3:55
be able to replicate it one of my
3:58
business mentors Todd Herman says if
4:00
you're gonna fail fail fast it's like
4:02
try this one thing and stick with it
4:06
long enough to know if it's gonna gonna
4:08
stay or if it's not gonna go like
4:12
you try this one thing and see you know
4:15
give it a hundred percent if it doesn't
4:16
work out then you can shift and try
4:18
something different but what you don't
4:20
want to do is be trying like 20
4:21
different things all once because it's
4:23
gonna spread your focus so thin that
4:25
you're not going to be really good or
4:27
have an effective strategy at any one
4:29
thing the number two reason you need a
4:31
strategy is because you're going to be
4:34
in so much better position if you step
4:36
back and you really look at your own
4:39
talents and your own weaknesses you can
4:41
come up with a strategy that counteracts
4:45
those weaknesses so what I mean for
4:47
example is if you know that you are a
4:50
slow writer and there's no question that
4:52
today's market favors fast releases then
4:57
if you come up with a strategy before it
4:59
like instead of just like charging
5:00
straight into the self-publishing career
5:02
you come up with a strategy where you
5:04
say okay so I might be slow so what I'm
5:07
gonna do is I'm going to pre write I'm
5:09
going to spend the next year pre writing
5:11
three books and then first thing in 2019
5:15
I'm going to start releasing those books
5:17
every three months apart and that will
5:19
give me time to have book four ready
5:21
that is a strategy if you just started
5:25
if you just had book one done and you
5:27
just threw it out there to see what
5:28
happened and it's gonna take you eight
5:30
months to write book two you're gonna be
5:32
in a much more compromised position
5:35
because you're slow writing but if you
5:39
step back and you really look at what
5:40
are my weaknesses what what is the
5:42
market doing how can I counter act my
5:45
own weaknesses you can craft a strategy
5:47
that's gonna help you succeed number
5:49
three reason why you need a
5:51
self-publishing strategy a few days ago
5:54
I posted a video about the one thing you
5:56
need to know before you self publish and
5:58
that is you need to know exactly what
6:00
you want out of this career and I'm
6:03
telling you that once you know that you
6:05
can use that like knowing what you want
6:08
you can use that to craft a strategy
6:10
that is going to get you further toward
6:12
your goals so instead of you know
6:14
following what everybody else is doing
6:17
you craft a strategy that works for you
6:20
to get you to your goals and I'm going
6:21
to use
6:22
an example I used before it's like
6:24
writer a maybe just wants to make as
6:27
much money as she can as fast as
6:29
possible she doesn't care what genre
6:31
she's writing she just wants to be able
6:33
to write and she just wants to make a
6:35
lot of money she doesn't necessarily
6:36
care about like building a long-term
6:38
career building a series that's gonna
6:40
sell long-term she just wants to make
6:42
money that's her number one goal maybe
6:44
she's got a lot of bills piling up maybe
6:45
she wants to take her family to Disney
6:46
Land
6:47
it doesn't matter why money is her goal
6:49
that's what she wants out of this maybe
6:51
she wants to quit her job and go
6:52
full-time writer and she needs you know
6:54
50 grand to do that writer B however
6:56
maybe their goal is completely different
6:59
maybe they're a stay-at-home mom who
7:01
just wants to make enough money to
7:02
afford to send their child to daycare so
7:06
they have more time to write more time
7:07
to spend on the things that they enjoy
7:10
but you know this writer has a specific
7:14
genre that she wants to write she has
7:15
this story that's been burning inside
7:17
her and she just needs to get that story
7:19
out and if it brings in a little bit of
7:21
money that's gonna be like the cherry on
7:23
top but money is not the sole focus is
7:26
just like the side project or side
7:28
product the number one focus is writing
7:31
this story that she's been dying to
7:33
write forever both writers are entitled
7:35
to those dreams and to wanting what they
7:38
want but their goals are so different
7:41
that their strategies are going to be
7:42
very different writer number one who
7:44
wants to without using a and B before or
7:48
was that saying I want to do I don't
7:50
know hopefully you guys are following me
7:52
here but writer number one over here
7:54
that just wants to make a lot of money
7:55
her strategy might be more along the
7:58
lines of I'm gonna go through Amazon and
8:01
I'm gonna look for what are the
8:03
trendiest topics right now she finds out
8:06
that hey like werewolf shifters are the
8:10
number one best-selling you know romance
8:13
right now so I'm gonna write werewolf
8:14
ship shifter she studies them she writes
8:18
a bunch of shorter books so she can have
8:20
more releases she releases them into
8:22
Kindle unlimited where she gets more
8:24
bang for her buck on her advertising
8:26
dollars or whatever and she you know
8:29
comes up with a budget she's gonna spend
8:30
like a thousand dollars a month on on
8:34
Facebook Ads
8:35
and she really hits that strategy she
8:37
makes friends with a bunch of authors
8:38
and she starts asking them to promote
8:42
her book she goes into group promotions
8:44
and she really hits the marketing really
8:45
hard but spends maybe less time on the
8:47
actual writing of the books because she
8:48
just wants to get them out quickly right
8:50
that would be her strategy it's gonna be
8:53
extremely different from writer number
8:55
two who really wants to write this
8:56
specific story and she wants to do a
8:58
justice for this story she's had in her
9:00
mind since she was 16 years old she's
9:02
going to have maybe more of a strategy
9:04
of I'm gonna take my time with this but
9:06
because I'm writing a little bit more
9:08
slowly I'm going to you know hold back
9:11
to book three before I start continue
9:14
you know before I start publishing and
9:16
because she wants to reach readers
9:17
everywhere she's gonna go wide and she's
9:20
gonna publish a Barnes & Noble and
9:22
Google books and all these other places
9:23
because she's got that strategy going of
9:26
she's trying to build a long-term career
9:28
and a series that's going to sell long
9:30
term so hopefully you can see from those
9:32
two examples that if you you need a
9:35
strategy because based on what your
9:37
individual goals are you can put
9:40
together strategy that's going to suit
9:42
you if writer number two was good
9:44
friends with not writer number one and
9:45
one said to her here's what really works
9:47
write to trends do this do this do this
9:49
and writer number two had no idea what
9:51
she really wanted cuz she hadn't taken
9:52
the time to think about it and she just
9:56
wanted to like figure it out because
9:57
she's overwhelmed and she decided to
9:59
follow writer number one strategy she
10:02
might start making money she might not
10:04
but she's not gonna get to her goal does
10:07
that make sense
10:08
she's gonna be getting to write her
10:10
number one school that's not where
10:12
anybody wants to be you want to follow
10:14
your own dreams so come up with a
10:15
strategy that suits your goals so that
10:18
you're not having to just watch what
10:20
everyone else is doing and constantly be
10:22
shifting gears reason number four that
10:24
you need a self-publishing strategy is
10:26
let me tell you you could waste a lot of
10:29
time following a losing strategy or
10:33
having no strategy at all so if you
10:36
didn't take time to put together a
10:37
strategy for what series you're gonna
10:39
write first what genre you're gonna
10:40
write first you know exactly how you're
10:43
going to build your career and how
10:44
you're going to build your fan base so
10:46
let's say you didn't have that and
10:48
decided you know what I don't know I'm
10:49
just gonna kind of you know fly by the
10:51
seat of my pants so what you might do is
10:53
you might say well I've got this one
10:55
short story that I wrote a few years ago
10:56
that's like a really great sci-fi so
10:59
you're gonna publish that under your
11:01
name that gets out there it's done but
11:04
you've also got this like really great
11:06
cozy mystery that you really wanted to
11:07
write so like you go ahead and you work
11:10
on that for a little bit you get it
11:12
published it's a you know great book
11:13
it's done you've got a few more you want
11:16
to write in that series but you also
11:17
have this like really great novella that
11:20
you wanted to write about the
11:23
contemporary romance thing that's like a
11:25
Beach romance and it's almost summer so
11:26
you thought this would be a perfect time
11:28
to do it so you put out your little
11:30
beach romance and then by the end of the
11:31
year you you're like I don't understand
11:33
what's happened I've got five books out
11:35
and nothing selling well the reason nine
11:37
times out of ten is gonna be because you
11:40
have like five different genres you've
11:42
got different lengths of books you're
11:44
putting it all under one pin name and
11:45
when someone comes to look for you and
11:47
see like like they loved your
11:48
contemporary room at speech series and
11:50
they go to look for book two and all
11:52
they find is like sci-fi and a cozy
11:54
mystery they're gonna be confused and
11:56
then probably aren't gonna buy it
11:57
because a lot of readers don't read
11:59
cross genre you get a few but for the
12:02
most part that's just not how this
12:03
business works and of course there are
12:06
going to be some people here and there
12:08
who like published a bunch of different
12:10
stuff and they found one thing that
12:12
really resonated but that could be that
12:14
could be your strategy like Hugh Howey
12:16
he published a bunch of short stories
12:18
until he found something that like just
12:20
really resonated he was like okay I'm
12:21
gonna keep writing that and that's how
12:23
all was born but he came into it with a
12:26
strategy of I'm gonna try all these
12:27
different things that's not gonna work
12:30
for most people unless you're like
12:32
publishing a lot of stuff really fast
12:34
but if instead of that first example you
12:38
said well I've got this sci-fi short
12:40
story that's finished and I really would
12:42
love to make that into a series then you
12:45
start coming up with a strategy of how
12:46
you're going to build that series how
12:48
you're going to build your pen name for
12:49
sci-fi how you're going to target
12:50
specific sci-fi fans now I understand
12:54
that the sad part about that is you may
12:56
love to write while
12:57
genres and you may really want to do it
12:58
but this comes back to down to what are
13:01
your goals if your goal is I don't
13:03
really care how much money I make I just
13:05
want to write what I want to write and I
13:06
want to write around a lot of genres and
13:08
I'm hoping that eventually I will build
13:10
enough of a fanbase then you do you you
13:12
do exactly what you want to do but if
13:15
your goal is to be able to make enough
13:17
money to pay for your son's daycare in
13:18
six months you're gonna have to be more
13:22
strategic about how to put those books
13:24
out there because publishing six
13:26
different books and six different genres
13:28
is usually not going to get you to those
13:29
goals so that's why it's important to
13:31
not only know what you want but to begin
13:33
to craft a strategy that is customized
13:35
to your desires and your goals the
13:39
number five reason why you need a
13:41
self-publishing strategy is purely for
13:43
visibility if you don't have a strategy
13:47
and you don't know how you're gonna
13:48
reach the readers you want to reach and
13:50
you don't know what kind of readers you
13:51
want to reach you're gonna have a really
13:53
hard time finding your audience and if
13:55
you can't find your audience you don't
13:57
sell books and if you don't sell books
13:59
you can't keep doing this unless you're
14:01
just like independently wealthy which if
14:03
you are good luck to you but I kind of
14:06
hate you now most of us are not
14:07
independently wealthy most of us need to
14:09
actually make a living at this and if
14:11
you do then the best way to do that is
14:13
to craft a strategy that's going to help
14:15
you become visible to the types of
14:17
readers that like your books so coming
14:20
up with a strategy for how you're going
14:21
to price your books how you're going to
14:22
release your books how you're going to
14:24
cover your books how you're going to
14:26
promote them how you're going to you
14:29
know come up with your author brand all
14:30
of those things will come together in a
14:32
strategy that will help you become more
14:34
visible to the types of readers that are
14:37
really going to enjoy your books and so
14:39
if you go into it with the out of
14:41
strategy you're going to miss a lot of
14:43
opportunity in the beginning to set
14:45
things up in a certain way because there
14:47
are certain things that are hard to
14:48
change or expensive to change like if
14:50
you go into this without really thinking
14:52
strategically about your book covers and
14:55
the types of readers you want to reach
14:57
then you could be looking at by your the
15:00
time you're on book four or five you
15:02
could be looking at several thousand
15:03
dollars to get better coverage for those
15:05
books if you don't you know think about
15:08
what type of pen name
15:09
or if you want to use a separate pending
15:12
for a different genre you've got to
15:13
think through all those different
15:15
questions to come up with a strategy
15:16
that's really going to work for you and
15:19
those are the top five reasons why you
15:21
need a self-publishing strategy I highly
15:24
encourage you instead of just going into
15:27
this business full force it's it's cool
15:30
to be excited it's great to be excited
15:33
but rather than just being like I'm
15:34
gonna take this one book and I'm gonna
15:36
publish it and hope that I make a lot of
15:37
money it's better just take a step back
15:39
figure out what you want and then start
15:41
developing your strategy and if you're
15:44
sitting out there right now and you're
15:45
thinking but Sara I have no idea what to
15:48
do I have no idea what kind of strategy
15:50
I should be building or even what
15:51
questions I have well you're in luck
15:53
because I will be over the next few
15:56
weeks talking about probably the number
15:59
one strategy that has worked for me to
16:01
sell over half a million books and it
16:04
may not work for you but I'm gonna give
16:06
you a bunch of different examples and a
16:08
bunch of different tips and tricks that
16:10
you can use to help you build your own
16:12
strategy I'll also have a course
16:14

16:19
through all those decisions that you
16:21
need to make and it's going to take you
16:22
through a bunch of different strategies
16:25
and if you would like I will also be

16:29
will bounce some ideas and strategies
16:32
back and forth with you so if you're
