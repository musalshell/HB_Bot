
hello welcome back to Harper things and
0:02
another notion walkthrough I'm so
0:05
excited for this video I have been
0:07
working really hard over the last couple
0:09
of months to integrate notion and some
0:13
digital tools with my beloved paper
0:15
planning and it is really starting to
0:18
work so I want to give you a little
0:19
sneak peek of what we're going to be
0:20
looking at today which is this content
0:22
creation Hub where I am magically
0:26
bringing together two separate Brands
0:29
all of my social media two separate
0:31
YouTube channels and my newsletters and
0:34
planning them in one master calendar
0:37
that I can also coordinate with my
0:40
assistant or operations manager and this
0:43
has been changing the game so I'm
0:44
excited to share it with you today so
0:47
let's get started
Why Use Notion
0:52
social media is such a huge part of my
0:56
business in fact both my businesses I
0:58
have two Brands I have the heart
0:59
breathings brand here and I also have my
1:01
Sarah Cannon author brand and I honestly
1:04
have built my social media just off of
1:06
posting kind of Whatever Whenever I feel
1:09
like it whenever I feel inspired but I
1:12
know without a doubt that if I was more
1:14
strategic about my social media I would
1:16
get better results and better
1:18
connections with my fans without having
1:20
to post as often as I am but honestly it
1:23
has been such a difficult thing for me
1:25
to plan ahead and I feel like finally
1:28
with notion I'm starting to get a handle
1:31
on it so it's really been all about
1:33
deciding on some systems and setting
1:36
things up in a way that is really going
1:37
to support me and I'm excited to show
1:40
you how that's working in notion but
1:42
before we get started I'm also really
1:44
excited to talk to you today about mint
1:46
mobile my partner for today's video so
1:49
obviously we as writers and creatives do
1:52
so much work on our phones I read on my
1:54
phone I'm posting to Instagram Facebook
1:57
I check my emails on my phone I am
1:59
pretty much doing a lot of my business
2:01
day to day on my phone so I need
2:03
wireless service that is really great
2:06
but why is it so expensive so many plans
2:09
out there are very expensive but it
2:12
doesn't have to be mint mobile offers
2:15
premium wireless service for as low as
2:17
15 a month without sacrificing your
2:19
coverage your speed or your data in fact
2:22
George and I are switching our family
2:24
over to Mint mobile and we are saving so
2:27
much money as a family
2:29
you might already be familiar with mint
2:32
mobile because of all those funny ads
2:34
with Ryan Reynolds who is also part
2:36
owner and who I actually adore but what
2:39
you might not know is that mint mobile
2:42
is actually built on the nation's
2:44
largest 5G Network and the reason that
2:46
they're able to keep their costs so low
2:49
is because they don't have retail stores
2:51
and direct sales people and everything
2:53
is done online which I actually prefer
2:56
because I hate having to drive to talk
2:58
to someone in customer service I just
3:00
want to be able to get someone on the
3:01
phone or on the Internet and be able to
3:03
order everything I need and get great
3:05
customer service that way so all mint
3:07
Mobile's plans have unlimited Nationwide
3:09
talk and text Lightning Fast 5G Service
3:12
as well as mobile hotspot also for a
3:16
limited time you can use my link to get
3:19
50 off their unlimited plan which gives
3:22
you the unlimited service for only 15 a
3:25
month which is just such a great price
3:27
also you can sign up for their mod
3:29
Modern Family Plan with just two lines
3:32
so you might want to check out all those
3:33
options when you click on the link
3:35
switching to Mint mobile is super easy
3:37
and it usually only takes about 15
3:39
minutes so 15 minutes to get your
3:42
Unlimited Wireless plan for only 15
3:45
honestly it's such a great deal and I'm
3:47
very excited to bring that to you today
3:49
you can use my link try mintmobile.com
3:53
heartbreathings to get started you can
3:55
scan the QR code also will take you to
3:57
the same page or I will leave that link
3:58
down in the description for you it
4:00
definitely helps out my channel if you
4:02
use my links when you make that switch
4:03
and if you decide to make the switch let
4:06
me know in the comments but I really
4:08
want to say thank you to Mint mobile for
4:10
partnering with me today and now let's
4:13
get back to our overview of notion when
How I Started
4:16
I first started thinking about how I was
4:19
going to set this up in notion I knew it
4:21
was going to be quite a task because
4:23
like I said I have two separate Brands
4:25
which means that I have two Instagrams
4:28
two websites two Facebook book pages
4:30
lots of different Facebook groups two
4:31
YouTube channels and it's a lot to try
4:34
to manage and even a lot of schedulers
4:36
don't let you use two different ones and
4:38
it can get a little bit overwhelming
4:41
also notion in and of itself though it
4:44
is really powerful and such a great tool
4:46
can feel a little bit overwhelming when
4:48
you're first setting it up so what I
4:50
started with was listing out all of the
4:53
different social medias where I wanted
4:55
to keep track of what I was posting so
4:57
that I knew kind of what I was looking
4:58
for my tool to do for me like what did I
5:01
want to put into notion what did I want
5:03
to track and how did I want to get
5:05
started on planning it then I made a
5:08
list of what exactly did I need notion
5:11
to be able to manage for me so I use
5:13
paper planners all the time so I'm using
5:16
those to strategize I didn't necessarily
5:19
need notion to be able to strategize and
5:22
write out my ideas but I did need a
5:24
place that I could easily keep and be
5:27
able to search through any video ideas I
5:29
had where I could keep my outlines where
5:31
I could put my thumbnails and I could
5:33
put title ideas and I could write out
5:36
series and be able to link to extra
5:38
resources so I just made a big list of
5:40
all the things that I wanted to be able
5:42
to do in notion and then I took out I
5:45
feel like this is always so ironic but I
5:47
took out a paper planner to start
5:49
mapping out how I wanted it to look so
5:52
that when I go into my notion I wasn't
5:54
overwhelmed with just the possibilities
5:57
of everything that you could do there
Content Hub
5:59
okay so let's dive into what this looks
6:01
like today I'm just going to be sharing
6:04
with you a walkthrough of this space and
6:06
how I'm using it my next video will be
6:09
an in-depth tutorial on how to set up
6:12
something like this for yourself and
6:15
then I'm also going to have a video
6:16
coming up talking about how do I decide
6:19
and plan what in the world to actually
6:21
post on social media which will not be a
6:23
notion video but just more of a social
6:25
media for writers or entrepreneur in
6:28
general so let's get get started on this
6:30
so I have created a page in my notion
6:35
that is integrated both in my personal
6:38
notion which is free but also in my team
6:41
notion which is something that I pay for
6:43
so that my operations manager can also
6:46
use this page but if you're just using
6:48
notion for yourself it's totally free
6:50
which is very cool so I have this
6:52
content creation Hub where I have these
6:55
cards here one for each sort of content
6:58
bucket and I'll talk about that in a
7:00
second then I have a master content
7:03
calendar that I can actually change the
7:05
view on based on whether I want to look
7:08
at just my Sarah Cannon brand or my
7:10
Sarah Cannon and my heart breathings
7:12
brand because as I explained in the
7:15
intro I have two Brands and this may not
7:18
be your situation but it also there's
7:20
probably some of you out there who do
7:21
have multiple Brands I have my Sarah
7:24
Cannon brand which is my author brand
7:26
and then also my heart breathings brand
7:28
which is this YouTube Channel and all
7:30
the courses and social media that go
7:31
with that
7:32
so here I can look at the master
7:35
calendar and see at a glance everything
7:37
that I'm posting from YouTube to social
7:40
media and Beyond or I can click on Sarah
7:43
Cannon and just see posts for that brand
7:45
or I can click on heart breathings and
7:48
just see posts for that brand there are
7:51
also other views that you can use in
7:53
Notions such as this timeline view
7:55
there's a kanban board view there's also
7:57
just a plain old list view if I just
7:59
wanted to see a list of all my content
8:01
and not see it on a calendar all of this
8:04
is in the same database the difference
8:07
is that I have that database tagged with
8:11
whether something is a Sarah Cannon
8:13
video so here you can see this
8:14
particular card says hbyt meaning Heart
8:18
breathing's YouTube whereas this card
8:20
has scyt meaning it's tagged as Sarah
8:24
Cannon YouTube so when I go through here
8:27
I can choose filters that allow me to
8:29
see whether it's a Sarah Cannon video or
8:32
a Heart breathings video so that filters
8:35
and tags allow me to take the same
8:38
Master database and see it in different
8:41
ways and filter out some of the
8:43
information which makes it super useful
8:45
and in fact one of the cool things about
8:47
this particular setup and about notion
8:50
in general is just that you can create
8:52
something once like a master calendar
8:54
and then you can use these filters tags
8:57
your status and other properties to
8:59
properly filter it out so that you can
9:01
see it on multiple different pages and
9:04
those databases communicate really well
9:06
with each other let me show you a little
9:08
bit about what I mean so if I go over
9:10
here and pull out this menu to the side
9:12
and I click on my private notion this is
9:16
the one that's free so this is private
9:18
no one else can see or get in here I
9:20
have my daily dashboard and everything
9:22
and if you love the way this looks or
9:23
you want to set something up similar to
9:25
yourself I have a detailed walkthrough
9:27
on exactly how to set this up so I will
9:29
link that for you down below where I
9:31
talked about how to set up my goal goals
9:33
and tasks here in notion but I also have
9:36
a writing log in here I have a to-do
9:38
list and then over here on the side you
9:40
can see I have my content calendar this
9:43
is the same content calendar in terms of
9:46
the database and all of the information
9:47
that we just saw on my team notion
9:50
content Hub and that is what I love
9:52
about notion is you can take the same
9:55
database and you can link it in multiple
9:57
places and I think that's where the
9:58
biggest power of notion comes in now it
10:01
is true over here that you can't really
10:03
read what a lot of this says because
10:04
it's very small now I could move this
10:06
content calendar over here and you'd be
10:08
able to see it a little bit better but
10:10
even here it's not super big but what I
10:13
could do is I can just click on any of
10:15
these things and I can see oh this is
10:16
the August notebook Challenge and here's
10:18
all the things that needed to go in that
10:20
notebook challenge so I'm able to see it
10:22
here in my personal notion and I can
10:25
just get an at a glance of the calendar
10:27
but when I click on this I can also go
10:30
into heartlandia which is Renee's like
10:32
team space and I can click on my content
10:35
creation Hub and I can also bring it up
10:37
here and this is that same exact
10:39
calendar just with a bigger page
10:42
so this is one of things I love so here
10:45
we're going to walk through exactly how
10:46
I have it set up there's only two
10:48
sections on the main content Hub there's
10:51
the planning dashboard which has these
10:53
little cards here for each of my content
10:55
buckets and then there's the calendar
10:57
itself the calendar is at a view where I
11:00
can see social media posts YouTube
11:03
videos I can also choose which
11:06
properties I want to show up on the
11:08
calendar so for here I've chosen the
11:10
title I've chosen which bucket it's in
11:13
Heart breathing's YouTube or Sarah
11:15
Cannon YouTube or whatever and then
11:17
whether or not it's been done and
11:19
whether or not Renee is completed with
11:21
her part too that is one of the ways
11:23
that we can communicate with each other
11:24
that she could see that I might say oh
11:26
my notion thing is done she comes in on
11:29
Monday morning she can see that it's
11:30
finished but she knows she hasn't done
11:32
her part then she can just open up this
11:34
page and do whatever she needs to do so
11:37
we'll walk through that in a second
Planning Dashboard
11:39
so here on the planning dashboard I have
11:42
cards and this is a gallery view and
11:46
like I said one of the things you can do
11:47
with every single database and notion is
11:50
you can actually click on this three
11:52
dots here and you can go to layout and
11:54
you can choose any of these layouts so
11:57
I've chosen Gallery because
11:58
aesthetically I want to be able to see
12:00
pretty pictures and make it look nice
12:02
but you could also just have it in a
12:04
list view here and it would just list
12:05
them like this or you could put it in a
12:08
table or a kanban board or however you
12:10
wanted to do it so I've got it obviously
12:12
on gallery and it just reset my
12:15
hold on so I have mine on gallery like I
12:19
said because I want to see aesthetically
12:21
like these little cards so each one of
12:23
these cards will open into a page that
12:27
then has all the information that I need
12:29
for that content bucket and you can take
12:32
your personal social media and content
12:34
calendar and separate it into whatever
12:36
buckets make the most sense for you so I
12:38
have two Brands so I wanted to make sure
12:40
that I kept them in buckets that made
12:42
sense for having two Brands without it
12:44
being so many that I had a lot to keep
12:46
track of if you have one single brand
12:49
like a pen name and then you also have
12:51
an Instagram a Facebook and a Goodreads
12:54
account you could keep those separate
12:57
and have those be your buckets or you
12:59
could just say YouTube versus this it
13:01
doesn't matter how you do it the
13:02
functionality is the same I've chosen to
13:05
do Heart breathing's YouTube
13:07
and heart breathing socials all go into
13:10
one bucket because a lot of times if I
13:12
post something on Instagram I'm also
13:13
posting it on Facebook and that content
13:15
becomes the same
13:17
then I have a Sarah Cannon YouTube which
13:20
my channel Sarah Cannon just got to 10
13:22
000 subscribers if you want to come
13:23
follow me over there usually we're doing
13:25
mostly live streams on that channel
13:27
coffee chats things like that then I
13:30
have a Sarah Cannon socials one and then
13:33
I also you can see have a Sarah Cannon
13:34
newsletter I do not have a bucket for
13:37
heart breathing's newsletter because my
13:39
heartbreakings newsletter mostly goes
13:41
out when I have a YouTube video my Sarah
13:44
Cannon newsletter though is separate
13:46
from my social media and YouTube so I
13:48
have it separately on here as well so in
13:51
my workflow what I like to do is down
13:54
here in the content calendar I can see
13:56
at a glance everything that has been
13:58
scheduled out everything that has a date
14:00
so I'm planning for this video my
14:02
content Hub walkthrough to go up on the
14:04
15th let's say it didn't get done in
14:06
time and I needed to push it back to the
14:08
16th I can just take this little card
14:10
and I can move it on the calendar that
14:12
will also change the publishing date
14:15
here inside to the 16th so that is
14:17
really nice that I can really flexibly
14:20
just move stuff around wherever I want
14:21
it to go on the calendar
14:24
but I also needed a place to keep track
14:27
of ideas that weren't scheduled out yet
14:29
so that's where these planning dashboard
14:30
cards come in so I'm going to click on
14:32
Heart breathing's YouTube and I have it
14:34
set to open in a full page here so that
14:36
I can see it in a full page and there's
14:39
only two main parts to this particular
14:42
page and what's cool about it is that
14:44
both of these parts the idea brainstorm
14:46
where I have a little kanban board and
14:49
the content calendar are really just
14:51
alternate views of the master calendar
14:54
filtered out and changed the view so
14:58
this is obvious it's the same content
15:00
calendar that we had on that home page
15:02
except it's now filtered to only show
15:04
things that are tagged for Heart
15:05
breathing's YouTube because that's the
15:08
card that we're in
15:09
but interestingly this is also pulled
15:12
from that same content calendar so
15:15
here's a table view of it for example
15:18
here's just a list of all the videos
15:20
that I have listed over here on the
15:22
calendar
15:23
but I put it into a kanban board so that
15:27
I can see what are just ideas meaning
15:30
they're not on the calendar yet because
15:31
they're just ideas what are things that
15:34
I know I want to create
15:36
what are things that are already
15:38
scheduled meaning it's already up on the
15:39
calendar but I just haven't started
15:41
filming it yet and then I have these
15:42
hidden groups here what's being filmed
15:45
edited uploading and what is already
15:47
completed and I created this again I'll
15:51
show you a complete walkthrough on how I
15:53
actually did it but I created this so
15:55
that I have a place that I can keep
15:57
track of all my ideas and my brainstorms
16:00
and a place that I can go ahead and
16:02
start planning out my content my
16:04
outlines my YouTube any images I want to
16:07
use stuff like that before it's even on
YouTube Work Flow
16:10
the calendar yet so the way this
16:11
workflow works for me is if I get an
16:15
idea of a video I might want to create
16:16
or someone mention something oh I wish
16:18
you'd make a video on that I can come
16:20
over here and just click new and I can
16:22
put a video up here so I can just give
16:25
it a name video idea when it is just an
16:28
idea and I haven't started actually
16:30
working on the video yet I just put this
16:33
little light bulb icon on here that is
16:36
another visual cue that Renee can say oh
16:38
I can see Sarah isn't even working on
16:41
that yet no big deal
16:43
when I know it's a video I'm going to
16:45
actually make like for example I know
16:47
I'm gonna set up this paquetto planner
16:49
I've talked about it before it's going
16:50
to be created I just don't know when I
16:52
can move it from idea over to to be
16:55
created and I don't have to worry about
16:57
it I just know that when I'm going to
16:59
look at my calendar for next week which
17:01
video do I want to create oh let's go
17:03
ahead and do this paquetto planner and
17:04
it gives me that idea when I know that
17:07
I'm actually ready to start working on
17:09
it I might not be ready to schedule it
17:11
yet but I might start working on it so I
17:14
can just click on it and it's going to
17:17
open up into its own page where I can
17:20
say publish date I don't know yet
17:22
because it's not scheduled whether it's
17:23
done what type of content is it's going
17:25
to be a video what's the status and this
17:28
you can see correlates to that kanban
17:30
board is it an idea to be created
17:32
scheduled or is it already in the
17:34
filming process and then we have a bunch
17:36
of other things here that we could fill
17:38
in including Graphics or anything that
17:40
we might want to put in I also have a
17:44
video creation template that looks like
17:46
this down below so I can put in here
17:49
title ideas anything I want to go in the
17:52
newsletter that goes along with that
17:53
video any pictures I want to take for
17:55
the thumbnail any b-roll video I want to
17:57
take and then an outline down here in
17:59
the main points once I have changed this
18:03
to a video I'm actively working on Renee
18:06
can keep an eye an eye on this
18:08
particular page and she can say Okay
18:10
looks like she's got the newsletter
18:11
filled out and she can go ahead and be
18:13
creating the newsletter using the
18:15
thumbnail putting it on social media and
18:17
stuff like that before I even have to
18:18
talk to her for the day and that has
18:20
saved us a lot of time and allowed us to
18:22
really work together in a better way
18:25
so once I am ready to actually schedule
18:28
this I can just take this little card
18:30
and go over here to the calendar and I
18:32
can say you know what I think this is
18:34
going to go up on the 31st because
18:35
that's where I have a hole so that's
18:37
where it'll go and now that it's
18:38
actually scheduled I can move it from to
18:41
be created to scheduled and I can
18:43
actually change This little light bulb
18:46
here since it's going to be a planner
18:47
we'll change it to this little notebook
18:48
image and now Renee can know that I've
18:51
already started working on it now if I
18:54
go into a video uh let me see if I can
18:57
find one that I didn't use that template
18:58
on yet
19:00
okay here's one let's say this video my
19:03
favorite books on writing
19:05
I don't have that newsletter and b-roll
19:08
and all that down here because that's in
19:10
a template here so I would set up this
19:12
template I would just click video
19:14
creation and it's going to Auto populate
19:16
all that and again I'm going to show you
19:17
exactly how to do that in my next video
19:19
but this type of thing is one way for me
19:22
to not have to recreate the will every
19:24
single time I'm going to create new
19:25
content it's all already here for me
19:28
this heartbreathing's YouTube is exactly
19:31
the same way I have set up my Sarah
19:33
Cannon YouTube because they're both
19:35
going to function the same way but this
19:37
way functionally I can keep track of any
19:39
ideas I have I can see when I've
19:41
committed to creating them I can go into
19:43
here and I can start making ideas on
19:46
what I'm going to create any type of
19:48
outline any quotes I want to use
19:50
anything like that and then I can
19:52
schedule them out when I have moved this
19:54
so remember I moved this paquetto
19:56
planner to August 31st when I go back
19:59
out to my main creation hub
20:02
there it is on the 31st so these
20:05
calendars are the same calendars just in
20:07
different places which is really cool
20:09
and again if I decided oh you know what
20:11
I've got something else I want to go up
20:13
that day I'm going to move it to Sunday
20:14
I can just move it and it will change it
20:16
in all of those places
YouTube Lives
20:19
like I said my Sarah Cannon YouTube is
20:21
set up exactly the same way except for
20:24
inside here I have a different template
20:27
I don't think I have one that isn't
20:29
filled out yet so let's create one so
20:31
let's say coffee chat
20:33
happens every Friday so I have a little
20:35
coffee icon if I click on this and I
20:37
come down here I will use a different
20:39
template for SC videos and that's going
20:42
to give me topics to talk about in the
20:44
live stream any q a questions I want to
20:47
answer and which thumbnail am I going to
20:49
use and then I can also tag this
20:51
obviously it's Auto tagged with Sarah
20:53
can in YouTube because I'm creating it
20:54
in this type in this section here but I
20:57
could also throw a graphic here and I
21:00
can also say the content type is going
21:02
to be a live stream
21:03
so again once I know this coffee chat
21:07
would go in the next place so I could go
21:09
out to September and I would schedule
21:10
this one for the 15th because that's the
21:13
next one and then put it into scheduled
21:15
and then change this little icon to a
21:17
copy so obviously it's less important
21:20
over here until I start creating other
21:23
videos besides just the live streams but
21:25
for October I do an event every year
21:28
called the Spooktacular and there's
21:30
going to be videos every single day so
21:31
this will become a very important idea
21:34
Hub during that time and this will allow
21:36
me to go ahead and start planning it and
21:39
getting Renee to start working on it
21:40
without any kind of friction between the
21:43
two of us in terms of our communication
My Social Media Hub
21:46
the next type or segment is my social
21:49
medias and we won't go super deep into
21:51
this because I haven't actually started
21:53
using it fully now I created all of
21:56
these but I wanted Renee and I to start
21:58
working on one thing at a time instead
22:00
of trying to do it all at once so the
22:02
first thing I created and we started
22:04
working on was YouTube starting
22:05
September 1st we're going to start
22:07
adding my social media to this now one
22:10
thing that you can see here is that I've
22:13
got the social media calendar at the top
22:15
but I don't have that same kanban board
22:17
here I decided and I might change my
22:20
mind but I decided I don't really need
22:21
the kanban board as much as I need the
22:23
calendar when it comes to planning out
22:25
my social media the other thing I did
22:27
want is a gallery view down here because
22:30
once I start adding in the thumbnail
22:32
images or the real cover images I'll be
22:35
able to see how well they coordinate and
22:37
I can actually kind of move them around
22:38
or see if the colors look right together
22:41
and I can plan out my Instagram feed
22:43
right here in notion
22:45
so
22:46
for heart breathings this actually
22:48
includes Facebook Instagram and
22:50
potentially YouTube shorts if I want to
22:52
put a reel up on YouTube shorts so let's
22:55
say Monday Wednesday Friday is when I
22:58
ideally want to have a real go up on
23:01
Instagram and a YouTube short
23:03
I can just put real one real two real
23:06
three and then when I decide I'm gonna
23:08
start planning it for the week I go in
23:10
here I give it a name I say which
23:12
content pillar it is and we'll talk
23:14
about that in video three and then I
23:16
have another template here what's the
23:18
caption what video do I need to take
23:20
that's going to go in this reel what
23:22
photos do I need to take what hashtags
23:24
am I going to use is there any like
23:26
trending audio I want to use and I could
23:27
link it here as well so this gives me a
23:30
chance not only to plan it out but also
23:32
to just hand all of that over to my
23:35
assistant and have her schedule it for
23:37
me and then maybe I don't know what I'm
23:39
going to post on Wednesday and Friday
23:40
but at least I have a placeholder here
23:42
in the calendar so that I can see that I
23:44
need to create something and that will
23:46
be pivotal for my planning process and I
23:49
can give you guys an update on how this
23:51
ended up working out once I've actually
23:54
started using it more often but for now
23:57
now this one isn't filtered properly
23:59
because it's still showing the coffee
24:00
chats but if I wanted to take YouTube
24:02
off here and only see the social media I
24:04
could just filter it differently so now
24:06
I've just got like a idea on September
24:08
1st I'm going to do an introduce myself
24:10
kind of thing now on my Sarah Cannon
24:12
socials I do have a few extra resources
24:15
here that I will be kind of fleshing out
24:17
in that heart breathings one which is my
24:20
links I have um some spreadsheets here
24:22
that have some social media idea
24:24
Generations I also have an idea
24:27
generation tool that I'll share with you
24:28
all in that third video about how I help
24:31
come up with what I'm going to post on
24:32
social media as well as links to my
24:35
scheduling platforms so all of that is
24:38
here right here in the content Hub I
Final Thoughts
24:40
have literally nothing in the newsletter
24:43
section yet so I'll update that when I
24:45
actually get moving on it but that is an
24:47
overview of how my social media planning
24:50
is going and how I'm coordinating with
24:52
my assistant here in notion so that is
24:55
it for the walk through of my notion
24:59
social media content calendar this is
25:02
working really well so far I'm excited
25:04
to implement the social media side of it
25:06
because I think it's going to take a lot
25:08
of stress off my plate to have it a
25:11
little bit more automated and I can't
25:12
wait to share that with you again I will
25:14
also have a full tutorial and and walk
25:18
you through every single step of setting
25:20
this up I know that notion can sometimes
25:22
feel a little bit overwhelming in terms
25:24
of starting with a clean slate but just
25:27
remember that you don't have to set
25:28
everything up and start using it all
25:30
perfectly right away you can do just
25:32
like me where you set it up a way that
25:34
makes you feel good and then you start
25:36
using one small piece of it and if it
25:38
doesn't work you tweak it until it
25:40
starts working and then you can add in
25:42
the next part so for now YouTube is
25:44
working great I'm excited to get started
25:46
with the social media scheduling part of
25:48
it because I think that is going to take
25:49
a lot of stress and time off my plate
25:52
and be able to get my assistant to help
25:54
me out more and maybe even hire someone
25:56
else who you can help out with that it's
25:58
going to be awesome and I hope this has
26:00
already given you some ideas let me know
26:02
for sure in the comments if you are
26:05
using notion and found some of my other
26:06
tutorials helpful and want to continue
26:08
to see more of them make sure that
26:11
you're subscribed here the planning
26:12
content is not going away in terms of
26:14
paper planning but we're going to
26:15
integrate some of it with notion and I
26:17
hope you enjoy that as well so don't
26:20

in order to be a successful author you must have every single detail of your
0:05
plot and plan figured out before you can begin writing whoa whoa
0:12
whoa if you are new here my name is Sarah Cannon I am the Indie author of more than 27 novels I've been doing
0:18
nanowrimo now for over a dozen years and I'm excited to get started on all this
0:24
preptober work but whether you're doing nanowrimo or not I hope this video is going to be helpful for you this is the
0:30
heartbreathings channel and I'm excited you're here let's get started
Types of Writers
0:38
so there really is no one-size-fits all to plotting and planning and getting
0:44
ready for your novel there will be as many different ways to plot and write a
0:50
book as there are authors it is really unique to each of us and sometimes to
0:56
each book that we're writing and really it's one of the most beautiful and exciting parts of being a writer is the
1:04
freedom that you have to be creative to make the decisions to find your voice and to express yourself but it's also
1:10
one of the most frustrating and difficult parts of being a writer because you have to figure it out and
1:16
there is no guidebook that tells you as an individual how to be the very best author you can be all we can do is learn
1:24
from each other share what works and what doesn't work and then in the end learn to trust our own intuitive ability
1:31
to tell stories so trust yourself for sure as we discuss planning your novel
1:38
specifically for nanowrimo but for any time of year I wanted to approach this topic a little bit different than I have
1:44
in the past because I have some videos on this topic before but first we're going to talk about
1:50
the different types of writers and different types of processes then we'll talk about the types of things that you
1:56
can plan and then I'm going to show you what my planning process is for this Nano so there are lots of different
2:03
types of writer planners so you have plotters now obviously plotters are
2:09
people who want to figure out the plot ahead of time so they tend to outline their novel they tend to know the
2:15
structure a lot of times plotters will figure out characters and settings and all these things I'm going to talk about in a minute they'll figure these things
2:22
out before they start writing so for a plotter pre-writing is often more work
2:28
than the writing itself and so it's a matter of figuring out scenes and outlines and character arcs and emotions
2:36
and different things like that that is not to say that all plotters are created equally some plotters have every
2:44
tiny detail stacks of note cards pages and pages of World building I have a friend that writes 50 plus pages of
2:51
outline before she even starts writing so you've got that type of plotter but you also have plotters that really just
2:58
figure out the major basic plot points a few things about their characters and then they move forward so a plotter can
3:04
be any part of that Spectrum then you also have pantsers Panthers are
3:11
typically people who fly by the seat of their pants they may have an idea for a character a spark of an idea for a scene
3:17
and then they're Off to the Races and they're Discovery writers at heart people who discover their story as they
3:24
write and then you know craft it as they go there are also people who don't fit
3:30
into the exact definition of pantser or plotter and I was at a conference once
3:36
and I heard the term Puzzler and it just always cracks me up because it sounds like a Batman villain or something but
3:43
it does resonate with me because it shared a part of my own process that I
3:48
didn't think was right because I had never heard anyone talking about it before so a Puzzler is basically someone
3:55
who has bits and pieces of their story so they may know a scene here or a character here and then they take those
4:02
pieces and then they start to build their story from those pieces but not necessarily in chronological order so a
4:09
Puzzler might get an idea for a scene go ahead and draft that scene write something about the character
4:15
figure out a couple things that happen here and there get an idea from that scene about how the end is going to go
4:20
and then start writing again and keep coming back to that puzzle and then the
4:26
picture begins to clarify itself over time rather than just being like I'm going to plot the whole thing in
4:31
chronological order and then write it a Puzzler might go back and forth between their writing and figuring things out
4:39
and not doing their writing in chronological order for some books this is the way that I have to do it for The
4:44
Disappearance of Vanessa Shaw that's the way I'm doing it because it's in alternate timelines and so I'm writing
4:49
pieces and discovering pieces as I go some people are what is lovingly known
4:55
as planters which is somewhere in between a plotter and a panther where
5:01
you have a basic idea of your structure you start writing and then at some point you go off outline and you just start
5:07
panting from there on this is also sometimes the way that I am I will have outlines and scene cards and everything
5:14
else and then that act one climax will twist things in a direction I didn't see coming and I will take that inspiration
5:20
and just move forward excitedly flying by the seat of my pants until I need to
5:26
come back and start plotting again when I get stuck and so one of the things I want you to understand and really want
5:32
to drive home as we start talking about how to plan your novel is this truth
5:38
that there is no right or wrong way you don't have to have everything figured out you don't have to be ashamed of
5:45
being somebody who doesn't know anything when you get started it's truly okay to just be yourself and to follow your own
5:51
process and that process might not look specifically like anything you've seen
5:56
on YouTube or heard from writers before and that is okay once you start to open your mind to the fact that you can
6:02
really make your own rules I think it starts to open up the possibilities of how you can plan now if you have written
6:11
a lot of novels before then what I encourage you when you start to do your planning for this next book is to really
6:17
lean into the things that have worked for you before really stop and think about when were you successful most
6:24
successful in your writing and what process did you follow how can you recreate that or replicate that what
6:31
problems did you have where did you get stuck in that writing process and how can you avoid it this time and just
6:37
taking that little bit of time to review your previous books and how things went might set you up in such a big way for
6:44
Success moving forward if you have never written a novel before and this is your
6:50
first attempt you might not understand what your writing processes but you can look for other clues in your life as to
6:57
what type of writer you might be so for example the last time you planned a big vacation or a wedding or some other big
7:04
event did you enjoy and naturally gravitate toward an entire planner
7:11
writing out every detail having you know your flight numbers and you knew exactly what restaurants you were going to and
7:17
your reservations were booked way in advance like did you plan every detail if so you might also gravitate toward
7:23
being a plotter when it comes to your writing or did you just buy the tickets on the whim and head out with nothing
7:30
but your suitcase and prayer if so you might be somebody who says I didn't have
7:36
a plan I'm gonna just go for it in fact when I went to Europe when I was in my 20s I had a detailed plan of everything
7:44
I was gonna do I was gonna visit every opera house I was gonna do all these things I had an exact itinerary planned
7:51
and the very first week that I was in Europe I tore that itinerary up and I decided to just go for it and and see
7:58
where life took me and that is often the way my novels are too in order to get up
8:03
the courage to start writing I like to have a good idea of what's happening and then sometimes when inspiration strikes
8:09
I throw out that outline and then I just move forward so think about how you've
8:15
been in the past in your life and how that might correlate to what type of writer you might be and what your
8:20
process is so if you have done nanowrimo before or you have written novels before
8:25
it is also super helpful to think about where you've gotten stuck in the past last nanowrimo for example did you
8:32
create a big outline line and then two weeks in you were through all of your content and you had no idea what else to
8:39
do or you were so far off your outline you didn't know where to continue or did you decide you were gonna pants it and
8:45
you made it three days in and then had no idea what was gonna happen next so think about where your sticking points
8:51
are and where you've sort of fallen short in the past and then make a plan for what you're going to do when you get
8:58
stuck this time maybe if you ran out of outline last time you need more ideas for what's going to happen next you need
9:04
to plot more maybe if you pantsed it and then you just couldn't figure out anything to write maybe you need a few
9:11
more details like maybe it would be helpful for you to go ahead and figure out your characters figure out what the ending is or the main conflict and just
9:18
Journal about a few of those things you don't have to plot everything but maybe a few more details would be helpful
9:23
or maybe you plotted to Perfection and then you froze or you it felt too
9:30
constricting to have so much of the plot figured out and you just couldn't find the inspiration to write if that was you
9:36
last year or on your last novel maybe you want to plan less this time so really think about your past work and if
9:43
you have not ever had any past work then just think about your process when it comes to planning other things in your
9:48
life and then do the best you can to plan for Nano so let's talk about the types of things that you might want to
What To Plan
9:54
plan so one is characters and I do have a video during this preptober series coming about how to plan out your
10:01
character's Arc so that's going to be super fun but you can plan what your characters look like what their
10:07
trajectory is what their history is what kind of person they are I have friends that do enneagrams and Myers-Briggs
10:15
personality test or archetypes different things like that so you can get as into it as you want or you can just write a
10:22
couple of lines about each character like he has brown eyes and he's a real jerk you know whatever it is you want to
10:27
write but getting some idea of the people that will be moving around in your world what they look like what they
10:33
act like what their basic personality is can be super helpful even if you're a pantser
10:38
if that calls to you so another thing that you could figure out is the setting of your novel so is it going to happen
10:45
all in one main location so for example my disappearance of Vanessa Shaw that
10:50
I'm currently working on mostly happens at the site of one lake house cabin so I
10:57
could be thinking how many floors are there how many bedrooms is it super rustic or is it
11:03
kind of Glam is it an older home is it relatively new is it really big is there
11:09
a basement is there a boat ramp are there a lot of trees around and I could be thinking about the general decor and
11:15
setup and basic layout of this space because my characters are going to be moving around in it and maybe I don't
11:21
want to make those decisions later if you're writing a fantasy world there's so much about setting and World building
11:27
that you could figure out ahead of time what's the government of this place what type of diversity is it what type of
11:33
creatures or animals lurk in the forest what type of weapons do they use do they have cars what's the technology there's
11:40
a lot of decisions that you could sit and make now some of those things you might discover as you're writing a rough
11:46
draft but having a basic framework of what this Society is like or what this world is like can go a long way when it
11:53
comes to planning your novel if you are writing fantasy or magic it can also be super helpful to figure figure out what
12:00
are the rules of this magic system or of this world so I'm writing a paranormal potential ghost story so what are the
12:06
rules of this ghost story can the ghost actually interact with humans are they going to see the ghost is it going to be
12:11
able to touch them like is it going to be a scary ghost I can make up those types of rules if I was writing in My
12:17
Shadow Demon Saga I might be thinking broader like who are the FAE what are their rules how do you cast spells how
12:24
do you get access to magic all of those kinds of things what does the magic look like when you cast it and again if
12:29
you're a pantser you may not want to figure this stuff out ahead of time but if you are somewhere in between you
12:36
might want to spend some time really journaling and thinking about what that magic system looks like so then we have
12:41
of course the plot and the plot is really what's going to happen in your story the outline of what's going to
12:48
happen in your story so this is a lot of where I focus my time when it comes to
12:53
planning and prepping for nanowrimo and I actually happen to have a lot of resources here on my Channel if you're
12:59
interested in plot there are so many different ways and methods that you can use there's the traditional three act
13:06
structure there's save the cat writes a novel there is the snowflake method the
13:11
implant embryo Dan Harmon story Circle and none of them are like right or wrong it's just what speaks to you and what
13:17
gets your imagination going I tend to use the three act structure so I have an entire video series here on YouTube
13:23
called how to plot your novel and it comes with this great free workbook and that workbook is actually what I use to
13:30
plot my novel so I'm going to show that to you in just a minute I know many of you have seen it before but you'll see the new setup of everything also I do
13:37
have a series on how to write a series and in that we talk about World building
13:42
so there's a workbook that goes with that as well and then I have one of my most recent series is how to write
13:48
scenes and in that is probably the most detailed explanation I've ever given of how to go from idea into developing what
13:57
actually happens next in your story on a granular like scene by scene level so if you haven't watched that yet I would
14:02
highly encourage you checking that out if you think you want to plan by scenes so lots of great stuff out there I'm
14:09
going to link all those playlists and videos for you and definitely come join my mailing list where I have a preptober
14:14
workbook for you and I also have tons of other resource on plotting and editing
14:19
and World building and writing scenes inside that resource library that you'll get access to okay so this is the fun
14:26
room this is my writing room if you are new to my channel this time last year
14:32
for prep and nanowrimo my family did not have a home we had been renting for five
14:37
years a couple of different places in Charleston we had been building a house and then because of covet prices that
14:43
build got canceled and then we had nowhere to live because our rental was already re-rented so we were living in
14:50
airbnbs and we lived in I think 12 over the course of several months and so we
14:56
were traveling quite a bit so this house is the first time that we've had a place
15:01
of our own that we actually owned that we were home in that we could feel secure in for years to come
15:07
in a decade and it just feels so good and I'm lucky enough that we had a space
15:13
in a fourth bedroom that I could create as my writing room so I have all my
15:18
tools all my planning stuff set up here and this is really where I'm hoping the magic will happen because I have really
15:25
struggled with my own writing over the past few years and it's it's the planning I kind of lean into pretty hard
15:32
but it's the follow through where I keep getting stuck so here's how kind of my planning has gone in the past and what
15:38
I'm hoping about my process will help carry me through to actually finishing
15:44
my first book this year during Nano so when I start a new book
My Plotting Wall & Tools
15:50
and I start my planning process I will often create spaces for me to plot and
15:56
structure or outline my novel one of the places I like to use is any kind of wall
16:02
or large space so that I can visually set out what's going to happen now in
16:07
this house I happen to have an entire wall that I can use in our previous rental house I just use the wall behind
16:14
the front door so it wasn't really beautiful it was out in the middle of everything but it was the only wall in
16:20
the house that I could use and luckily my husband didn't mind so I have easel paper that I just got off of Amazon and
16:27
I just roll it onto the wall and use masking tape or painters tape so that I don't mess up the wall and I can use
16:34
tombow dual brush pens flip chart markers or Crayola super tips on this
16:39
and it's not going to bleed through and basically this is the three act structure so you have act one
16:47
and then you have act two is the largest part of most novels movies and other
16:52
types of modern stories and so there's kind of a part one and there's a part two and in the middle of it is the
16:59
middle of your story or the midpoint of your story which is often a kind of this changes everything sort of moment
17:06
and then you have act three over here on the end which for me typically is the shortest of the three Acts so having it
17:14
visually arranged like this allows me to expand my mind to visually see what is
17:22
happening in my story and when I'm planning my story I like to use both sticky notes and other media to create
17:31
the story grid so over here I do have another little one just because I had space that kind of walks you through or
17:37
reminds me of the eight characters because I have eight points of view so I've color coded them and this kind of reminds me of that and then I will be
17:44
putting their character arcs up on here and then over on this side I have a little bucket that has all of the
17:51
Post-it notes for the color codes and then I've got my markers some dot markers and some other pins and things
17:58
in the color code now just as a quick tip when you're deciding if you decide you want to color code your novel I
18:05
highly recommend color coding according to like choosing colors that you can
18:10
easily get like at your local office supplies store so you wouldn't want to choose like teal or some other kind of
18:17
color that's difficult to get in a Post-It note if you wanted to be able to use them because then it's hard to like
18:23
coordinate your Post-its with your markers whereas if you're using basic colors like orange pink blue green you
18:31
can find them in any any store I will use both this now if you don't have a
18:36
wall or you don't have this much space to yourself you can use poster board that you tape together and you kind of
18:42
fold it and put it behind a bookcase so that it can be out of sight when you want it to be you could also just use a
18:48
roll like this and roll it out on the floor and use it and then roll it up and put it away in the closet every night so
18:54
there are other Solutions or if you don't need something big you can just use a planner so this is what I tend to
19:03
use so I used to use a big happy planner this is discs bound system so that you
19:08
can pull the pages easily out and put them back in but now I use a smaller version this is
19:15
the classic size happy planner but I wanted to kind of show you an example of a completed novel for me where I have
19:23
basically that same story structure laid out in a planner that I have up on the
19:28
wall and I use page Flags so something like this that you can get at any office supply store just their just play page
19:35
flags and they're you usually I will use the paper ones for this but if you
19:41
decide that you want to use plastic ones like something more like these sort of plastic page Flags then
19:48
you would need something like a Sharpie marker to write on them because a regular pen is just going to smear but
19:54
what I love to do is I love to sit down with a visual representation of the
19:59
three Acts color codes if I'm going to use them in terms of page flags and stuff and start thinking about what are
20:05
the scenes that I already know in this book so do I know how it starts
20:13
do I know what that midpoint is that changes everything do I can I see like visually that final scene or final
20:20
battle in my head I may not know all the details but I know that it's going to be perish against this person or it's going
20:26
to be the whole group gathers together in the middle of downtown New York like I might have a few small things already
20:33
figured out so I will write those scenes that I know on these page flags and add
20:38
them where I think they go now as an example when I first started plotting
20:45
I still used this basic structure but I just did it in pen so you can see here
20:51
I've got all of this this is my first published novel and I just kind of wanted to pull this out I've never shown these I don't think before
20:58
and this wasn't my first draft of this this was probably the sixth or seventh
21:03
draft so I will figure things out it'll change it'll shift I'll write a little bit of the book and then I'll come back
21:09
to it and so this was like the final iteration of it but I realized very
21:15
quickly that when you're writing with pin you can't really move scenes around as easily so that's when I started using
21:22
page Flags so that I could if I decided this scene actually needed to happen in
21:27
act one I could easily move it around I also wanted to share that this is a later book in my career and you can see
21:35
that I never even plotted half of act two because sometimes for me I'm a mix
21:41
of that I'm more of that Puzzler person I may know and write some of the ending scenes I may know and write some at the
21:48
beginning but then some of this I'm just gonna pants because I there's no way I can actually figure out what happens
21:54
here until I'm writing it so I'm a mix of a discovery writer and a plotter but
22:01
I plot a lot but some things are just left up to figuring it out at the time
22:07
and so that's why I started this video with kind of talking about those three different processes because if you can
22:12
figure out how much of this planning and how much of the story do you need to
22:18
understand before you're ready to start putting it on paper you're going to be so much better off and in fact if you're
22:25
a pantser don't look at this and think that this means nothing to you or you could never use it because one way you
22:31
could potentially use it is either in your editing process when you're reevaluating your novel and trying to
22:36
mix it up and move things around or as you're writing let's say it's the end of your writing process for the day you
22:43
could potentially sit down and say well I wrote this scene this scene this scene and just add it to your story grid and
22:50
then when you sit down tomorrow you can add tomorrow's scenes so that by the time you're finished with your novel you have a clear layout of what you did
22:58
right even though you didn't have this this wasn't a pre-writing thing for you this was a as you go kind of thing which
23:04
might help you with your editing so there's all different different kinds of ways so how do I figure out what happens
23:11
in each of these scenes so I have recently created a video about how to
23:17
figure out what happens in your scene so if you haven't watched that yet I highly recommend that you watch it but
23:22
something that I wanted to say in this particular video that I feel needs to be said in the community is just that I
23:30
think it can feel like when you see something like this or you see a story grid or you see a completed novel it
23:37
seems like the process for that writer was that they just sat down the idea of
23:43
what to happen next just came to them easily and then they wrote it out chronologically and then there was a
23:49
book and this is really like a myth this is not something that
23:54
happens to most of us and I don't even know anyone this really happens to maybe
23:59
if you're writing very short formulaic stories it can be a little bit easier to just kind of plug and play because your
24:05
stories are more similar but for most of us it takes time and it's a process of
24:12
back and forth so you might figure out a little bit about what happens in act one and the way you do that is you you learn
24:19
about how stories are and you think about what's the main conflict how does my story begin where am I starting and
24:25
how does my character get pulled into this new world of love or this new world of mystery or you know whatever happens
24:32
what's that inciting incident and once you start to visually see that you start planning those scenes and then when you
24:40
start writing it might all change and then you have to come back to the plan and you have to figure it out it's a
24:46
messy process so I want to encourage you by saying let it be messy just get in
24:52
don't give up on yourself and I think this is really part of how I failed myself over the past couple of years
24:57
because I have been so determined to force it to come together that I haven't
25:03
been willing to get in and play with it because my time I don't have enough time
25:08
to just sit and think about the story and so this is something I'm changing in
25:13
my life now and hopefully moving forward and I hope this is why I'm going to be successful this year for nanowrimo
25:19
Diaries and actually finishing a book this year because I want
25:25
to remind myself that writing a novel is a messy process it is not likely that
25:31
I'm going to sit down and be able to plan this novel from start to finish with no issues and then sit down and
25:36
write it from start to finish there's going to be pieces that don't come together as easily and there's going to be work involved and so I hope that you
25:44
feel encouraged by that because everyone's process is messy and it's okay for yours to be messy too
Plotting Planner Examples
25:52
okay so let's dive in just a little bit to this planning process so first of all
25:58
if you're using three-act structure or save the cat or anything that you have
26:03
studied before in order to figure out the plot of your story I highly recommend making yourself some kind of
26:10
like cheat sheets or notes about it so for me I have taken all of my favorite
26:16
books on writing and I have created these little uh story guides I guess or
26:24
cheat sheets that are like okay the disturbance is a plot point that I know I want to start the book with so here's
26:30
what these books that I love say about the disturbance so it serves as a kind of reminder of what that plot point is
26:37
all about so that when I get stuck so for example if I'm like what was the
26:43
doorway of No Return number two like this end of the second act okay the lead passes through doorway blah blah blah
26:49
blah okay that reminds me it triggers a memory of the studying that I did so
26:55
kind of like if you're a good student which I am a learner by Nature a student by Nature so this really helps me to
27:02
have this sort of cheat sheet reminder of what happens in each of those plot points
27:07
then like I said I have this now classic happy planner that I just created
27:12
through these discs I bought on Etsy these are little dragonfly discs and I
27:19
also bought this cover on Etsy and most of it is either things that I've printed out or it's a combination of that and a
27:26
few of my happy planner pages so I have my word count tracker in here now you
27:33
can find this inside your own preptober planner if you wanted to download that and a lot of these resources you can
27:39
find for free in my resource Library all you have to do is sign up for my email list and I'll send you a link to a
27:45
Google drive folder that has all of this stuff in it and basically this is how I
27:51
like to track and I follow that process that I told you about in the preptober planner flip through to figure out how
27:57
many Sprints I'm going to need to do to finish my book so that is the word count tracker that I have all printed out
28:04
sometimes I will put the book cover in here as well just as motivation if you
28:10
already have it and then I have my plotting sheets now you can see because I'm already working on this book that
28:15
some of these are already filled out now the these are sheets that I created but
28:20
you could create any sheets you wanted based on the books you've read or the studying you've done or the process that
28:26
you have but I like to have a couple Pages where I work on my character Arc
28:31
and what I know about my character and why they're involved in this story and then I get into the actual plot of
28:39
the novel so for me three act structure act one opening scene the setting the dramatic question the argument against
28:44
transformation the door of No Retreat the doorway of no return the key event stuff like that now I didn't fill this
28:50
out on the sheet because some of it is still tentative but I did write it out on another piece of paper so a lot of
28:56
times what I will do is I will just print out dot grid paper that I bought off of etsy and I will put it into the
29:03
planner to use for my notes and then I just have one of these disc hole punches so I have most of Act One figured out
29:12
and a lot of Act 2 is not figured out but here's where I was talking about knowing your process all of the ending
29:19
stuff I know like I can see that in my head I know exactly how this story ends the stuff that I'm still kind of
29:26
puzzling out is this is Lorelei she's the main character and she's the one
29:32
who's mostly driving the narrative in the present but there are going to be flashbacks of each of these characters
29:39
and all the stuff that happened leading up to The Disappearance of Vanessa Shaw
29:44
and as Lorelei sort of investigates what happened she's going to discover
29:49
everybody's secrets that they were hiding and eventually she's gonna hopefully
29:56
find the truth so I know at the beginning and I know the end but it's
30:02
this middle part that I don't necessarily know so what I'm going to be doing in my personal planning for now
30:09
I'm going to be working on this book in the month of October but also probably continuing on to December I don't know
30:17
yet we'll see how it I doubt I'm going to finish this in October we'll just put it that way but you never know
30:22
so what I'm going to be doing for myself next is I am going to be spending some
30:28
time thinking about each character and how they play a role and how each one of
30:33
their secrets gets discovered now I already know what each of their secrets are so this is one of those things of
30:39
like figuring out your own process and how much of the story you need to have figured out before you're ready to write
30:45
so for me I knew that in order for this to all come together I needed to know who the real killer was so that I could
30:52
kind of work backwards in hiding that from the reader
30:57
and I knew that I was going to need to figure out what each character's secret is so the tagline for this particular
31:04
book is everyone there had a reason to want Vanessa gone including me and so
31:11
everybody there has some kind of secret or reason that they hated Vanessa or that they wanted her to not spill the
31:18
beans on their secrets or something like that so I have all of the different characters and kind of they're just
31:23
Basics about who they were I have more about Lorelei here because she's my main
31:28
character and then I have detailed Secrets here I won't hold on to that too long because I know there's some of you
31:34
are excited to read this book when it's done but I know what all of their secrets are so my next point of planning
31:42
is to figure out how does Lorelei learn their secrets over the course of the
31:48
present day night and how does that come into the story in terms of the flashbacks and so I've got some work to
31:55
do right um I am going to be using this happy planner page that I've kind of created
32:01
as a plotting planner I've got my page Flags here where you can see I actually have all
32:07
that one figured out a smidgen of act two part one and then I I do actually
32:13
have act three figured out I just haven't put them on page Flags yet so it's this middle part here and in
32:20
between some of lorelei's point of view I do want to add in some more of these other alternate flashbacks so this is
32:27
kind of the planning for me but as you can see it's not like I sat down and said this this this this this and it's
32:33
all figured out by the time I get ready to start actually writing this which if
32:40
you know I've already written twenty thousand words like years ago so I'm kind of editing the first part of it I
32:46
would love to have that beginning the midpoint and the end figured out because that's my process but I don't actually
32:52
need to have all of this part of act to figured out because that will come as I'm writing and I can trust myself that
32:59
that will come so it's a mix of plotting and then coming back to it over and over but for the first time ever I'm actually
33:06
going to also be using this fun grid paper so this is just like graph paper
33:12
in a big tablet this is probably like for designers and stuff I don't know engineers
33:18
probably not specifically designed for writers but I saw my friend Holly black was using this and I decided I wanted to
33:25
try to use it myself and I think how I'm going to use this is I'm going to structure this out with each character
33:32
and their secret and then Lorelei like their secret and how that secret came to
33:37
be known by by Vanessa in the past because those will be the flashback scenes and then on the page also saying
33:44
present day Lorelei how does she find out about it and what does that tell you
33:49
does that tell the reader that this is the person that killed Vanessa or how does that play into the main role so I'm
33:54
gonna probably like segment this out by character and then have it and then
34:00
write out those scenes and figure out those scenes here and then I probably also will use some of these sheets for a
34:06
basic timeline of not only the past so I'll do a timeline of the past and then
34:12
a timeline of the present so here's what happened leading up to the night Vanessa disappeared and then here's what
34:19
happened when they go back to the cabin and here's Vanessa or here's lorelei's trajectory of how she figured out or
34:26
here's lorelei's timeline of how she figures out what happened to Vanessa so I think this will be really fun and cool
34:33
to use another thing that I do like to use is index cards so I have an entire
34:39
video on how to plan your novel using index cards and here I have the four points of view for my Shadow Demon Saga
34:45
which I'm going to talk about more in my video coming up about how to plot POV multiple POV and series books but I also
34:53
do have some index cards for this book instead of using index cards that are
35:00
colorful for Vanessa Shaw I decided to just use white index cards and then use
35:06
the pins to delineate the different points of view because I couldn't find all the colors that I wanted like orange
35:12
and yellow posted or orange and yellow and pink cards so I'm just using the
35:17
color full pins to color code on those but I do like to sometimes have these on
35:24
note cards especially if you decide that you're going to participate in some of the nanowrimo write-ins it can be really
35:29
nice because you might not have the space on the table to bring an entire big plotting notebook but you should be
35:36
able to fit you know a small handful of index cards if you would like to take those with you
35:42
but for me that's kind of the next step in my plan I am not going to print out
35:48
this workbook that I have for each of the characters like the point of view characters in this particular book
35:54
because they don't all have a character Arc in this book it's really just more
36:00
focused on their flashbacks and their secrets but the main character who has an arc is Lorelei so she's the one that
36:06
I'm focused on for this book but I will share coming up when I start talking about my book 12 of My Shadow Demon Saga
36:13
the four main characters there's six characters in that book but there's four main characters and they each do have
36:19
their own full character Arc so it's a different kind of way of writing when it comes to that so we'll talk about that
36:25
in a future video but when I am actually planning if I were starting from scratch
36:31
what I would do is I would print out this workbook which again you can grab for free and I would start filling out
36:38
everything I know about the characters and then start filling out the scenes that I know and under understanding that
36:43
it's not always going to be that I know every scene in order sometimes I'm going to know one here and one here and one
36:49
here and one here and then I'm going to gradually begin to build my plot just like putting together a puzzle and then
36:54
once I have as much as I feel I need to feel inspired to start writing then I know I'm ready for Nano so I hope you
37:01
found this helpful and if there's anything that I missed or any of those videos that you see on my channel that
37:07
you would like to see more of or more details on just let me know okay that's it for planning your novel and I have

37:20
your hands and you're deep into prep mode definitely go watch some of those videos I'll have them all linked for you

38:17
thank you foreign [Music]
nanowrimo is just around the corner and we have spent so much time talking about
0:06
how to prep your novel how to figure out your story but there are other factors
0:11
at play when it comes to any type of writing deadline where you have a time constraint and that is all the external
0:19
things to your story your life your meals where you can save time your decision making so today I'm going to
0:25
give you some practical tips on how to plan your life for nanowrimo or any
0:30
writing deadline so let's get started
Time
0:38
we do talk so much about the index cards and the plot and all of those things but
0:43
there are like I said other factors to success during an event like Nano or any
0:49
type of writing deadline that has a tough time constraint so the first of
0:55
those is your time so a lot of times what we do is we just say okay I need to
1:01
write 2 000 words a day and we leave it at that and while that might work for
1:06
some people who have a lot of flexibility in their schedule for many of us full-time jobs full-time moms
1:12
whatever it is that you're working on our schedules are already so busy that if we don't actually carve out enough
1:18
time on a sustainable daily basis there's no way we're going to hit our word count targets just because the math
1:25
doesn't add up so let's look at it this way if you know that your average
1:32
sustainable words per hour rate is about a thousand words per hour which actually
1:38
is kind of fast but let's just for ease of numbers say it's a thousand words per hour
1:43
for nanowrimo if you are writing the minimum number of words per day which is
1:49
30 days you have to get at least 1667 Words which means that you need
1:56
more than an hour at a thousand words per hour in order to hit that you probably need to plan for about two
2:03
hours a day to make sure that you hit that 1667 and in fact those need to be
2:10
too full like uninterrupted not distracted doing your average best
2:16
type of writing hours and you need to make sure that you do that every single day for 30 days well like we talked
2:23
about in the preptober planner there are things that always come up we need to add in buffer to our schedule so
2:31
migraines sick kids work emergencies there's any number of things that we
2:37
might come across or family holidays I've got a conference I'm speaking at in November there's lots of other things
2:43
that might come up that might take us from 30 days of writing a minimum to well we only really have 25 writing days
2:50
so if you download that preptober planner there's an exercise on a calendar that's going to walk you
2:55
through that process of what's your average word count per hour and then how
3:01
many days do you actually have to work and that's going to help you figure out how much time per day you need to
3:06
dedicate yourself I know that lately I've been writing about that speed about 500 words per Sprint or since a Sprint
3:14
is about 30 minutes about a thousand words per hour and I know I need to hit somewhere between two thousand and 2500
3:21
words per day because of my schedule and so if I set aside two and a half hours a
3:28
day that should give me around 2000 to 2500 words every single day that I'm
3:34
writing and that will set me up for success but here's the massive truth bomb that I want to drop on you right
3:41
now it's like my tough love from Sarah right now is that if you set aside less
3:47
time than you need to write the words that you need you are setting yourself
3:52
up for disappointment if you have a thousand words per hour
3:58
that's kind of your average and you say well I've got an hour per day so I'm just going to write my very best and see
4:04
what happens you're very unlikely to suddenly start going from a thousand words per hour to 1667 words per hour it
4:13
can happen some people can do it but for most of us we need to show up as we are we need to plan for the person we are
4:20
today not the person we wish we were so if it normally takes you two full hours
4:26
to write 1600 words you need to make sure when you look at your daily schedule for the month of November that
4:33
you have carved out two full hours to do that writing time and for some of you if
4:39
you write more slowly than that you might need three hours a day so it's super important if you want to plan for
4:45
success and you want to plan your life around Nano start thinking about how much time you realistically need per day
4:52
to hit the word count goal you want to hit and it's just simple people math so you might say well okay Sarah but how do
4:58
I just magically carve out this time well when we're on deadline
5:04
sometimes there are sacrifices that need to be made I can't tell you exactly how to carve
5:10
that out all I can tell you is try to have some awareness of your schedule and
5:15
your responsibilities Where Can you steal time so some ideas might be okay I'm gonna start waking up an hour before
5:22
I normally do so that I can get that full hour in in the morning you might
5:27
say okay I usually take my lunch break and scroll funny memes on Instagram I'm
5:33
gonna do a 30 minute Sprint during lunch instead so start to dedicate yourself
5:38
and start to identify where you can reclaim some time maybe it's going to be
5:44
that you plan and prep your meals ahead of time which we'll talk about during this video that you don't have to
5:50
actually spend a full hour prepping your menu or maybe you can enlist the help of
5:56
family members which we're going to talk about as well so anything you can do to reclaim that time
6:02
and I'll tell you this take the pressure off yourself if you
6:07
start to look at your schedule and you say you know what I need three hours a day to realistically hit 1667 or
6:14
whatever your word count goal is and I just can't find that time then you can enter nanowrimo thinking okay I'm
6:22
probably not going to be able to hit the 50k but according to the math and my schedule I know that I should be able to
6:29
hit 30k and make that your goal because nanowrimo is supposed to be about fun
6:35
it's not like somebody comes over and gives you a best-selling author career just because you hit 50 000 words in a
6:40
month it's really just about taking out that inner editor and getting some words on the page and building community so if
6:47
you think realistically the most time that you can carve out and dedicate is going to get you to 30k then set that as
6:53
your realistic goal and then dedicate yourself to it and be proud of it when you hit that goal but you can't expect
7:00
yourself to become Superman or Superwoman overnight just to hit this goal and then find yourself disappointed
7:07
at the end of the month because it's not your fault that you didn't win it's simple math you just didn't have the
7:14
time and that's okay so another tip that I'm going to give you that's going to help you with the time factor is
Executive Function
7:20
eliminating as many Superfluous decisions as possible so I'm not
7:26
familiar with all of the brain science involved here but there is this capacity
7:32
of our brains called executive function and this is basically what we use to resist temptation to focus to make
7:40
decisions and there's a limited amount of it that each of us has per day and
7:45
once it's depleted it's depleted until we rest and sleep and recover and so if
7:51
you've ever had a day where you like ate perfectly and you did everything you were supposed to do but then by the time
7:57
you got home from work you were just like I don't care about my diet anymore I'm eating Pizza I'm ordering pizza or
8:02
you had planned to exercise until somehow you just can't force yourself to do it that's likely because your
8:08
executive function was depleted by the actions you were taking earlier in the day and the same thing comes to writing
8:14
especially if the time that you can carve out for yourself to do your writing is in the evening this is going
8:20
to be in particularly important to you because if you sit down to write say 8 pm at night and your executive function
8:27
is gone you might find that you struggle to make decisions about what's happening
8:33
in your story and maybe even you struggle to focus in maybe you struggle
8:39
to not want to open the phone and get distracted by a bunch of things and you know what if you're distracted that
8:45
thousand words an hour can easily become 200 words an hour and now you need 10 hours a day in order to hit your goal
8:51
which is kind of impossible for most of us so we need to eliminate as many things as we can that are
8:59
draining our executive functions so these may sound like really simple tips like how is that really going to help me
9:05
but I promise you because I have implemented this in my own life and it's part of how I get more done that if you
9:12
can eliminate decisions that you don't need to actually be making on a daily basis you will preserve some of that
9:19
executive function for your writing so two of the biggest places that I'm going to give you examples of today are your
9:25
meals and your wardrobe so let's take a look the next place that we can save
9:31
time is our closet but mine is a bit messy so hold on I'm gonna clean it up
9:37
Mary Poppins Style okay there that's better and that brings
9:43
me to one fundamental point if this is the right tip for you which is that
9:50
if you can take some time here in October or anytime before you're starting a big deadline project and just
9:56
tidy up clean up your spaces so that nothing is chaotic and you have a clean
10:02
floor so everything feels good this can be so good for your mental health and creating space in your mind for the
10:09
creativity that you want to do let's say now your closet is completely clean
10:14
one of the ways that I can waste some time every day is if I walk into my
10:21
closet and I see all of these clothes and I think what am I going to wear today and I stop and I maybe try this on
10:28
and then I'm like I kind of don't look good in that today or what shoes am I going to wear and then I try to pick out something else and then I don't have the
10:35
right shorts clean and it just becomes a several minute to sometimes half an hour
10:40
ordeal of what do I wear today especially for me because I'm going to be on camera all of November so it can
10:47
be a real time sink so one of the the things that I try to adopt when I am on
10:53
Deadline or I'm super busy is something I learned from taking a course called the 90-day year by Todd Herman and he
11:00
calls this the product protocol but you can see this in big CEOs fashion
11:06
designers people like Steve Jobs when he was alive wore the same type of uniform to work every day and not only did they
11:13
become known as that being their signature style the reason that they do
11:18
it because it eliminates the need to make a decision if you wear the same
11:24
outfit every single day then you don't have to worry about what am I wearing it eliminates and creates an automatic
11:30
Choice and then you have all that extra brain power decision making and what we call Executive function to work on your
11:37
story and make decisions about your book so it saves time and more importantly it saves mental
11:43
energy so what I would recommend is going through your closet and seeing if
11:48
you have enough similar things or something that you can wear over and over again that you can kind of create
11:55
for yourself a daily wardrobe now I'm not saying you have to go out and buy new clothes but you might be able to
12:01
check through what you have and realize that you have you know seven
12:06
graphic tees and seven pairs of jean shorts or two pairs of jean shorts that
12:12
you can rewear or eight pairs of yoga pants or black leggings or whatever you
12:17
might find that you have something that you can wear over and over again okay so let me show you what this looks like for
Daily Uniform
12:22
me having a daily uniform so I live in Texas so it's right now it's been like
12:29
35 degrees but it might also be 80 or 90. I have no idea so I definitely want
12:34
to plan for layers so I have this red hoodie and up there I also have a black
12:39
hoodie ready to go so two different colors and then I have a pile here of
12:44
the same shorts and some tank tops and they're very neutral colors I kind of
12:50
have gone with this pattern of red black and white and I have some basic tank
12:56
tops that are more cotton just simple tank tops from Amazon these were a two
13:01
pack for maybe fifteen dollars and then I also have some ribbed tank tops from
13:09
Target and these are scoop necked and they're only five dollars a piece so something super simple easy don't have
13:16
to make a decision I know they look nice on me and I can throw it and mix and match the colors
13:22
and then I got these shorts which are Super comfy and I love them from Amazon
13:29
and these also come in a two pack and you can get two black ones a gray and a black so I just have a bunch of these
13:35
that I've been wearing now just as my uniform so that I'm not making those
13:40
decisions so the way this works for me is I have this particularly prepped for
13:47
Nano um but I will also throw in there that I have I'm currently wearing these like
13:54
black leggings and fuzzy socks and I do have several pairs of these black leggings as well so if it's particularly
14:00
cold or I need to go outside and it's too cold then I will throw on the black leggings or a pair of jeans instead but
14:07
keep the tops the same and the way this will look for me is in this dresser here
14:13
I have a drawer that I specifically have kind of prepped for Nano so on one side
14:20
I'm gonna have the shirts on another side I will have my shorts and then I
14:27
will of course off camera add in another one that has some underwear
14:32
and the hoodie will just go on the back of my chair and every morning when I get up I will be able to just grab what I
14:41
need out of this drawer and I won't have to go into my closet to try to make a decision and it'll be so automated and I
14:49
know that this does sound so simple like why would this work but I'm telling you it can be life-changing for the right
14:56
people some people don't want to wear the same thing every day but having some kind of comfortable uniform that you can
15:01
rely on throughout a deadline can be so helpful because you don't want to deplete any of that executive function
15:08
so just walk over here grab if I grab a red shirt and a black pair of shorts
15:13
then I'll grab my black hoodie most likely and a pair of underwear and I'll be done for the day I don't even have to
15:19
go into my closet which might be a little bit more overwhelming I also have some of these fuzzy socks on the side as
15:25
well as a couple pairs of the longer leggings and if I need to I can dip into my closet for jeans if I need to be a
15:31
little more dressed up if you have a full-time job you might not be able to wear something comfy like
Meal Planning
15:38
that every day but what you could do is you could go ahead on Sunday if that's your prep day and you could pick out
15:44
your five outfits that you're wearing Monday through Friday to the office or whatever your job requires you to do and
15:50
have them set out so that you're not making that decision in the morning and then you could have a setup kind of like
15:55
mine for when you get home from work changing into either different pairs of shorts or your favorite comfy PJs or
16:02
whatever works for you can help with that transition time from work to okay now it's writing time I've got my
16:08
uniform on let's go now let's head into the kitchen and you guys are going to
16:13
see if you stick around for the nanowrimo Diaries you'll start to see ways that our house is starting to come
16:20
together and you'll notice that it's never like perfectly clean but we're gonna go over what you can do to help
16:26
with this executive function for meals so one of the best places you can eliminate decisions and really really
16:33
save more time and brain function is doing a little bit of meal planning so in your preptober planner you will find
16:40
a actual planner where you can go through and choose like four or five
16:45
breakfasts four or five lunches a few dinners a week and I find similar to the
16:51
uniform that if you have the same breakfast every day and you're not making decisions or maybe you alternate
16:57
breakfasts and you have them prepared like specifically plan breakfast that you can prepare in advance it can be so
17:04
helpful in Saving Time and decision making ability and one of the ways that you can do this is you can grab some
17:11
basic like these are Rubbermaid they can be washed on the top rack of the dishwasher they can be put in the
17:16
microwave and you can go ahead and prep stuff so if you pick a day of the week that's going to be your prep day like
17:23
for me I go ahead and plan things out I have a little happy planner which probably comes as no surprise to anybody
17:28
that has all my meals for the week that way my husband can also see what we're
17:33
eating for the week and my breakfasts are basically the same almost every day I have two breakfasts that I rotate
17:39
between my lunches are the same every day I just have a salad and then the dinner is a rotation where every Monday
17:45
is the same thing every Tuesday is the same thing and I know this tip won't work for everybody because sometimes you get
17:52
bored with the same food but if you could try it just for Nano you might be surprised at how much it helps but I
17:58
will plan out the meals on Saturday go ahead and place a grocery order in the app for my local grocery store so that I
18:04
can just go and pick up the groceries and they just load them in the back saves me time then I come home and I
18:10
prep the food so if I'm doing I don't like to put salads in these because they don't stay really good very long but one
18:16
of the meals that I have been doing for lunches sometimes too is taking like veggies like celery carrots zucchini
18:24
stuff like that so I will take one of these and I'll put like hummus and a hard-boiled egg in this side and then
18:31
I'll put a bunch of fresh veggies in here and then I can prep five of these and leave them in a stock in the
18:36
refrigerator and then all I have to do when it's lunch time is come and grab them and I can actually eat this at my
18:42
desk too or I can you know get it done very quickly and that is really the key eliminating decisions make making your
18:49
food really automatic so if you prefer more variety than eating the same thing every day then plan for that but try to
18:56
plan meals that you can prep ahead and have a crock pot full of pasta or something or chicken and then you can
19:01
put it in here and heat it up every day start getting creative with those meal choices also another thing that you can
19:07
pre-plan is if you are somebody who tends to get distracted while you're writing by oh I need to go grab a snack
19:15
and you find yourself sitting in front of a pantry trying to decide what sounds
19:20
good right now a piece of Trail Mix or a piece of cheese with some nuts and that way you've got a stack of these in the
19:26
pantry or better yet right on top of your desk that you can just grab and you're not wasting 30 minutes by going
19:33
and trying to find a snack another thing that I love to do is when I go shopping I really think about the things that
19:39
make me feel indulgent but that are simple treats so I kind of have an
19:44
obsession with fresh fruits and what I call Bubble water so this is like
19:49
Seltzer flavored water or um like San pellegrinos stuff like that and so I
19:56
will fill my fridge up with beautiful full colorful fruits and vegetables that I can see and like that I can see
20:03
through the containers and all the waters that I love and that just makes me feel like I'm supported like I'm
20:09
happy like I'm excited and again these simple things can help so much and we'll talk about this more when we get into
20:14
mental health so what else let's talk writing space so when similar to what I
20:21
was talking about with your closet when your room is or your writing space is really messy it can also be difficult to
20:28
make decisions and feel supported and feel like you can just get started
20:33
writing because our brains will naturally go to especially when we're stressed or we're on Deadline our brain
20:39
sometimes will naturally go to oh I really got to get that laundry done oh I better start working on all the stuff
20:46
that needs to get cleaned up but if you show up your your desk and everything's already clean and organized then it's
20:52
hard to procrastinate and you're much more likely to say okay I'm gonna sit down you don't have to search for anything you don't have to go looking
20:58
for for stuff you can just sit down and start writing so I have this idea of
21:03
potentially like a portable workstation so this is super fun for me now I do
Portable Workstation
21:09
have an office space but sometimes I want to go outside to write sometimes I want to be in bed writing and some of
21:15
you may not have a dedicated office space so you might be already riding on the couch or sometimes wherever you can
21:21
find Space so grabbing yourself an inexpensive but nice functional laptop
21:28
desk can be really nice I got this one from Amazon and it has a little mouse pad here so I've got this little kind of
21:34
cheap Bluetooth mouse and I've kind of growing a collection of nice keyboards
21:40
that I really enjoy so this is about 25 on Amazon and it works with anything Bluetooth so I have my iPad currently on
21:48
here and I can write on Google Docs and I can also connect my phone to here and I don't have my phone with me but I
21:54
could set my phone right here and be watching the Discord channels or I could
21:59
be watching the admin Sprint with the hard breathing's writing Community while I'm also writing here and that can be
22:06
super helpful and I can take this anywhere around the house I don't have to clean up a desk I
22:12
don't have to worry about anything else now you might also if you do have a dedicated writing space want to take a
22:18
little bit of time to clean things off so that it feels fresh and it doesn't give you that kind of mental to-do list
22:24
but if you don't have that space consider creating for yourself a little workstation and make decisions about
22:32
what you're going to use to write on what program you're going to use and
22:37
where you're going to back your work up those decisions can be so good for your mental health but the other thing is
22:44
what about creating a portable caddy so let me show you kind of how I put this
22:50
together foreign
22:58
[Music]
23:03
[Music]
23:20
[Music]
23:29
foreign [Music]
23:47
so this is perfect for just carrying around anytime you want to go right in
23:53
your bedroom or wherever and then you don't have to go searching for everything you've got your earbuds your blue light blockers you've got your
23:59
Pomodoro Timer your favorite writing gloves and all of your index cards and everything you need right here at your
24:06
fingertips instead of it's all in drawers and you have to go searching for things Little Steps like this can help
24:12
so much I will see if I can find a link to this where I got it on Office Depot and then I'll also see if I can find a
24:17
similar type of thing on Amazon but you could use a diaper caddy you could even use a purse organized organizer if you
24:24
wanted as something like this to carry around the house but I like this little caddy it's super cute okay so you've got
Purse Organizer
24:30
your time back because you've planned appropriately you've meal planned you've
24:35
got your uniform if that speaks to you of course if any of this doesn't seem like your thing these are just tips that
24:42
you might enjoy but they're not like must Do's but they might surprise you at how much they make a difference for you
24:47
but let's talk about some other things that might help you plan your life for Nano one of them is getting your friends
24:55
and family on board so one of the biggest distractions can often be the people who
25:02
live with you in your own home so how do you eliminate some of that distraction well it sort of depends on
Eliminate Distractions
25:10
your personal situation and I know that there are some of you that are living in households where you have people who
25:16
just don't support the work that you're trying to do or they don't believe in you and and let me tell you my heart goes out to you because I understand
25:23
that life and for some of you it's just gonna be survival mode and it's going to
25:28
be saying I deserve to take this time for myself and I'm gonna keep it as my private time and maybe you don't even
25:35
want to share necessarily what's going on because you don't want to be little belittled or distracted so my heart goes
25:41
out to you if that is your case however for most of us hopefully we do live with
25:46
people that as long as we just communicate with them what we need during this time of deadline and time
25:52
crunch they will help us out so it can be as simple as sitting down with your
25:57
partner or your parents or whoever you live with and saying hey I've got this exciting event coming up this is really
26:03
important to me or hey I have this deadline coming up and here's what I'm trying to do and walk them through your
26:09
plan and say hey these are the two hours that I've determined I have time to get this done does this work for the family
26:16
and make sure that you get some input from them and they may be able to identify more spaces or you can also say
26:22
hey can you actually help me with getting these dinners on the table if I plan for the meals and I make sure all
26:29
the groceries are ready can you do the cooking or I need you to make the decisions about what we're having for
26:35
dinner every night because I'm not going to have the mental capacity for doing that you could also say hey I need a
26:42
little bit of extra help with the laundry this month could you help me and when it comes to Partners hopefully you
26:48
can get some of that support and it just is a matter of communicating and letting them know what you need when it comes to
26:55
potentially Littles in your house sometimes they don't always understand so some of the things that have worked
27:01
for me are getting them involved in the Awards and saying okay Mommy needs this
27:08
one hour to write so I'm gonna leave you with this coloring or painting activity
27:13
or I'm Gonna Leave You with these new little horses or ponies or whatever or
27:18
Andrew can you watch your little sister for an hour and you guys play together with these blocks and I need this time
27:24
and if you give me this time without any interruptions and I get my word count then we can have
27:31
pizza for dinner we have a pizza party this weekend or if you can give me this we're going to go to the park on
27:38
Saturday and get them involved with the rewards and it can also help to keep them updated on how your progress is
27:44
going throughout the month so that it's not like okay we're with you mom for the first week or dad and then you know
27:51
second week they've all forgotten the boundaries so it can be about expressing
27:56
your boundaries expressing your needs maybe you want to put a sign on your office door that says I'm writing leave
28:03
me alone for a little while actually in the back of your preptober planner there's a sign that says something like author at work so you know do not
28:10
disturb put that on your bedroom door or wherever you need to put it so that you can let them know when this sign is up
28:17
this is the boundary and I'm setting this for myself and I need this and once December comes I'm all yours again but
28:24
this is for me and communicating that can be hugely helpful another thing that can be super helpful
Identify Distractions
28:30
when it comes to your friends or your your when it comes to your family or people living in your household is to go
28:36
ahead now and identify when those interruptions come and make a plan for it so if you notice that every time you
28:43
try to get up at 6am and write your husband's coming in and talking to you about what he heard on a podcast that is
28:49
something that you can plan for and you can communicate and say okay if he wants to talk to me about podcasts then we can
28:55
do that from 6 to 6 20 and I need to let him know at 6 20. okay I love that I'm so glad we got to spend this time
29:01
together but now it's time for me to write and even set an alarm on your phone and let your husband know that okay I want to spend this time with you
29:07
but when this alarm goes off I gotta get to writing so I would really appreciate your help um and I know I'm using like husband in
29:13
whatever terms but just insert whatever your current situation is into that but making sure that you have a plan in
29:20
place so if I know every day when I try to write from four to five I'm gonna have Andrew getting home from school and
29:26
there's a lot of other family distractions but that's the only time I could carve out then I need to have some
29:31
kind of plan in place which means maybe taking a minute in the morning to set up a project a coloring project or some
29:38
kind of craft project so that when Andrew walks through the door I know that he can start working with Evie
29:44
rather than being in my office and pre-planning for those distractions can be a game changer okay I know this has
Transition Ritual
29:51
been a bit of a long video with lots of different tips and I hope that some of them have resonated with you but I want
29:57
to leave you with one final tip and that is planning out some kind of ritual for
30:03
yourself to get your mind in the right place to sit down and write when we are go go go go go all the time and we have
30:09
this massive to-do list and the laundry is looking at us and all we want to do is just sit down and take a break and
30:15
scroll social media or turn on Netflix during a deadline period like Nano you're gonna have to get yourself into a
30:23
transition mindset because if you sit down with this hamster wheel going through your head that 500 words per
30:30
Sprint is gonna go down to 100 words per Sprint and you're gonna wonder why you're struggling well it's because your
30:36
mind is too busy and when we have that much going on it can be so helpful to
30:42
give yourself a transition ritual and it can be fun to create that now so let's
30:48
say you come home from a long day at work you know you've got to get straight into your chair which is not your normal
30:53
thing but this is your writing time and your mind is buzzing with all the things that happened at work
30:58
come up with a peaceful transition ritual so for me this looks something
31:04
like laying down on the floor semi supine with my knees bent hand on heart taking some deep breaths
31:14
letting everything that's in my mind just float away so I had a therapist once that took me through an exercise
31:21
where she had me a mat anytime I thought would come up she had me imagine that it went into a big bubble and flowed it
31:28
away bubble float away so as you're transitioning from one thing to a nut to
31:33
the next let your mind empty and any thoughts that come up to interrupt you just let them go
31:39
and that will get you into a quieter calmer space and once you're there then
31:44
you can start your ritual to invite your Muse maybe it's putting on your comfy
31:49
socks or your comfy uniform that you created for yourself maybe it's lighting a special scent of candle or a Scentsy
31:57
Warmer maybe it is uh creating your space putting your crystals out putting
32:03
your music on in your earbuds but make sure that part of your ritual is opening
32:08
your manuscript no matter what you're going to open that manuscript not opening your phone not opening
32:14
distractions but opening your manuscript and anything it can be a five minute ritual or it could be a 15 minute ritual
32:21
or whatever you need that can help you transition from one busy type of mindset
32:26
into the quiet of I'm ready to write is going to be golden for you because our
32:33
minds are some of our greatest tools and we can plan all we want when it comes to the story but if we're not in the right
32:38
mindset to focus focus on it it's going to be difficult so I hope these tips have resonated with you again take what
32:45
you want and leave the rest I am in the description box going to have those recipes for a couple of those sort of
32:51
sugar-free make ahead snacks but it's so helpful if you can just sit down right now with your preptober planner or any
32:58
list or notebook and think of what are five meals that I could go
Outro
33:04
ahead and pre-plan and just rotate over and over if you like to eat the same if you don't mind eating the same breakfast
33:10
every day if you don't mind wearing the same clothes every day go ahead and pre-plan that and get it all set up and
33:15
I guarantee you that you're gonna be surprised at how much more space that
33:21
gives you in your mind for writing so I hope these tips have been original and helpful we only have one week left of
33:28
preptober where we're going to talk specifically about mental health for authors during deadlines like nanowrimo
33:34
and how to give yourself credit and be proud of yourself no matter what word count you ended up with and then on
33:40
October 30th we are going to have a special panel of admins from the heartbreathing's writing community that
33:46
are going to help answer your questions so it'll be a live stream q a and I'm so looking forward to it also if you didn't
33:53
hear this week and all of next week for the 13 days of Halloween we are celebrating over on my Sarah Cannon
34:00
YouTube channel and blog for what we call the Spooktacular which is the yearly anniversary of my first novel
34:06
beautiful demon so if my videos have helped you and you want to pay it forward some ways that you can do that
34:11

34:18
books so my best-selling shattered even Saga starts with a free box set of three books so you could let people know on
34:24

34:30
first release by downloading that free book and giving it a read even if you don't normally read young adult novels
34:37

1:12
watching till 3:00 a.m. oh yeah I'm so excited yeah you're in the course oh that's awesome hey guys hey Chrissy I
1:18
see several people that are in the course this round so I'm excited to see you guys and so as you know some of you
1:25
know I'm running a sorry I've got messages coming up on my phone I'm
1:31
running a boot camp right now that will start on Thursday night that is a three-day intensive goal-setting boot
1:38
camp for writers and creative entrepreneurs for how to set your goals today we're going to be talking about
1:45
20:19 writing schedule but I also combine this with my 90 day system so
1:51
hey Cheryl oh yeah you're in the course - I'm excited so I combined this with my
1:57
90-day goal setting system because as writers especially if you're a professional writer but even if you're
2:03
someone who like works full time and just writes in the evenings or if you're a parent and you've got a lot of things
2:09
going on you and it's very important not to just plan your writing schedule but also to plan
2:17
your entire like business your marketing your family life everything else that
2:23
you're doing and it can sometimes seem like we don't have enough time to get everything done
2:29
which you know spoiler alert but we just don't we really in this very busy day
2:35
and age we could work 24 hours a day and never come close to getting everything
2:41
done so what we have to really do moving into you know even more busy times
2:48
especially as authors is we have to really start looking realistically at our time and really thinking about how
2:57
we're gonna set ourselves up for success and where we're going to spend our time versus you know just honestly like for a
3:04
few years what I was doing was throwing spaghetti at the wall I had what I
3:11
thought was a plan but really whatever grabbed my attention at any given moment
3:17
is where I spent most of my time so I would get up every morning with like a kind of an idea that oh I want to write
3:24
2,000 words today but an email would come through a message on my facebook
3:29
Messenger a friend would call a jillion things a reader would email me and say oh I can't get this to download and
3:36
whatever seemed to be the emergency of the moment was a hundred percent what took my time and so I absolutely failed
3:45
on the majority of my goals so what I had to do after some of you guys who
3:50
have been watching my channel for a while what I had to do was I had to really take a step back after severe
3:56
burn out and start looking at a better way to manage my time and so today what
4:03
we're going to talk about is just this little piece of planning your writing goals and your writing schedule for 2019
4:10
and I'm super excited thank you oh my gosh we have 89 people here this is gonna be like my biggest live ever
4:16
excited 90 people welcome welcome I'm so glad you guys are here so in the
4:22
comments as we look to the 2019 writing schedule process I'm gonna kind of walk
4:28
you guys through it so like I said I've got a download for you that you can get over on my blog which is heart
4:34
breathing's calm slash blog it's the very first post or if you're on my mailing list I already sent it to you
4:40
through email today so you can go get that after the oh yeah Thank You Alison
4:45
so some of you may already have it downloaded but it's fine we're not going to actually like go through it today I'm
4:51
just gonna kind of walk you through the process so that you can do this yourself later but if you are here and you're
4:58
watching I want you to give me a yes in the comments if you have had the past
5:04
few years of your life where you say you know here's my plan for the next year
5:10
and you have grossly overestimated what you thought you could do like for
5:15
example I'm gonna write eight books this year or I'm gonna finish three books and
5:22
then you get to maybe March or even January and you haven't even
5:28
accomplished a piece of it or you say I'm gonna write five books this year I'm gonna have the best year ever and then
5:34
you get to the end of the year and you haven't even finished one book so I'm seeing like a lot of yeses come through step on it and of course they're like
5:41
hands yes yes yes this is so common I think that part of it comes from the
5:47
fact that you know we're creative people and we really love feeling motivated we
5:55
love feeling excited and when we think about having our best year of all time we think about how can we have the most
6:03
productive like amazing incredible year and so when we plan our goals or we set
6:08
our goals for the next year it's very exciting to think about the possibilities of what we might achieve
6:13
so we look at that and I think okay this is gonna be the year that I like blow
6:19
everything out of the water this is gonna be the year I changed my life maybe that you're even saying things like this is going to be the
6:24
I lose those 30 pounds this is the year and we set these huge goals for ourselves because being realistic feels
6:31
kind of like boring like well if I'm super realistic does that mean I'm a failure should I be like upping the ante
6:38
every single time every single time and it gets kind of exciting to plan those huge goals but I'm going to make a case
6:46
today for realistic goals and I think
6:52
sometimes it can feel like oh gosh I don't want to be realistic because when we're realistic we realize all the
6:58
things we can't do does that make sense for me when I look at my schedule realistically sometimes
7:05
it breaks my heart because I'm like but I if I want to achieve my life's goals I have to write those seven books this
7:12
year and if I don't then I'm Way behind in my whole life
7:17
and we feel like we put all of this pressure on ourselves to find success really fast to have our best years to
7:25
have our you know absolute like yes so many books Christie says so many books calling to me to write and it's it can
7:31
be so disappointing to think that you know if you have 18 books on your like
7:36
wish list that you really want to write and you think about if you can only
7:41
write two books a year you know that's gosh that's like the next nine years of your life and you're not gonna get to enjoy any new ideas in the process and
7:48
that can start to feel like almost suffocating like but I have to work harder I have to write more but my case
7:56
for thinking realistically is this you
8:01
can't do that you're not going to nine times out of ten when you set goals that
8:08
are pretty much impossible you're not going to actually do it so instead of
8:16
having your best year what ends up happening is you carry that feeling and that sense of panic of always being
8:23
behind of always feeling overwhelmed of never getting it done of having so much
8:28
to do that you can't possibly get it done and you sabotage yourself the
8:34
entire year and for me that also would often translate into a lot of
8:39
negative self-talk so instead of you know having the most powerful and
8:45
exciting gear of my life I would trash myself all year long like well here we
8:53
go again Sarah this was supposed to be your best year and now you're you know January 3rd and you're already behind
8:59
that means you're not gonna do it yet again this year and what a disappointing blah blah blah like I think it's creatives we tend to get harder on
9:06
ourselves than anybody else is and if you don't have this problem of negative self-talk and you usually hit your goals
9:13
then this is going to be a breeze for you but I'm talking to the people that really set yourself up for these huge
9:21
amazing like we expect ourselves to be at max capacity like suddenly magically
9:26
we are going to like 4x our productivity this year and it's just not realistic
9:33
and actually if you go through when you go through this process we're going to actually look at our time and how much
9:39
time you have to produce words next year and to work on your books you might see
9:45
that like in fact to get those 900,000 words you thought you were gonna write you would have to literally have you
9:51
know be working 29 hours a day which is not going to happen so we're going to
9:58
look at it realistically ok so I'm gonna read a couple of comments here if I can
10:03
bring that back up when I think realistically I feel we were depressed I teach high school English so realistically I wonder what is the point
10:09
of me writing when so many people don't read well you know actually I know you have you know you're in high school
10:15
English but there actually are probably I would say more people reading now than
10:21
there ever have been because we've got digital books and it reaches people in
10:26
you know every single part of the world so you've got people that are reading that didn't have access to a lot of
10:32
books before and you may not see it as much in your high school English class but I promise you there are millions and
10:38
millions of readers out there and they are looking for your books and they want you to be successful and to write the
10:43
books of your heart because they are going to you know it's going to change their lives or it's gonna entertain them
10:49
in some way it's going to impact them so you definitely it's definitely worth your time to write I know it can feel
10:56
hard to be realistic but and of course when I'm talking about realism here I'm talking specifically about your schedule
11:02
and how much time you have to write so I'm going to say what I want you guys to
11:09
do for just a minute is really think about if in the past you have approached
11:17
your goals or your writing schedule from a place of fear and it might be a hard
11:22
thing to admit to yourself but I think that this is why we expect ourselves to
11:28
have these huge years and we don't get super realistic about what we can achieve because we're afraid we're
11:35
afraid that we're not going to be you know a full time writer we're not going to make as much money as we hoped this
11:41
year if we don't write faster we're not going to like Christy said write all these books that are in our heads and
11:47
you know time is gonna slip by if we don't get started now maybe we're never going to get published publishing is
11:54
getting harder you know there's all these things that we can tell ourselves that are coming from a place of fear and
12:00
what I want you to think about is stepping back from that fear for just a
12:05
minute and instead start thinking about what would happen in your life this year
12:13
if you approach your goals with your writing from a place of power instead of
12:21
from a place of what happens if I don't do this or maybe I'm never gonna be good enough or maybe I'm never gonna make
12:26
enough money and just push those kinds of thoughts of your mind and instead come from a place of power where you can
12:34
actually say to yourself when you look at your writing schedule you can go oh
12:39
my gosh I can really do this I can really do this instead of looking at
12:45
your writing schedule and going oh my gosh this is gonna be the hardest year I've ever had right instead of saying
12:52
there's no way I can do this I know I'm not gonna be able to do this I'm gonna be a failure yet once again this year
12:58
it's if coming from that place come from a place where you say like shoulders back
13:04
head up I'm actually going to achieve it this year and that means I'm going to get all of these books done or I'm gonna
13:11
finish my first book or I'm going to actually write my first rough draft and how good is that going to feel to be
13:16
standing here one year from today at the end of December 2019 having achieved all
13:22
of your goals it would feel amazing right I promise you this kind of stuff
13:28
being realistic about your writing time can be life-changing so that's why we're talking about today there's two huge
13:34
benefits to me to being super realistic about the time that you really have number one is eliminates all those
13:41
feelings of being way behind because when we don't realistically estimate our
13:47
time we might do something like say I'm gonna finish this book in two months and you're gonna start in January and you're
13:53
going to end it by the end of February but when you didn't take into consideration is the fact that you've
13:59
got family that's gonna be here till January 5th you've got a birthday party to go to on the 20th you've got a trip
14:06
to LA coming at the end of the month and then a couple of other things going on in February so you're giving yourself
14:12
you think two whole months to get this done but in truth you only have ten days that are full writing days and you
14:19
didn't look at your schedule oh gosh you're so sweet Melissa that you didn't
14:25
really look at your schedule you know realistically so you're already way behind before you even get started so
14:33
that's one thing you eliminate this feeling when you look at it realistically you give yourself the time
14:38
you actually need to complete your project you suddenly apply monnet all these feelings of not being good enough
14:45
of the negative self-doubt of the negative self-talk give me a yes in the
14:50
comments guys or some hands raise your hand if you fall victim sometimes to
14:55
negative self-talk like telling yourself you're not going to be able to do it look at how far behind you are this book
15:03
isn't any good I'm not getting the words in I know I'm gonna see a lot of a lot of yeses
15:09
because it is exactly it Teresa it's a daily kind of thing inner critic yes I'm
15:15
and you you know and as you wouldn't be mean to your best friends like that you're just mean to yourself and what I
15:23
want to help you do in 2019 because this is going to make all the difference in
15:29
your life is I want to help you eliminate that negative self-talk by
15:34
setting writing goals a writing schedule for yourself that you can actually stick
15:40
to so eliminates feeling so behind so we're gonna eliminate some of that
15:45
negative self-talk because you're gonna be in a place of power next year instead of a place of fear and overwhelm number
15:53
two and this is a good one when you get real about the time you actually have
15:58
and the number of projects you can actually complete next year it forces you to focus on the things that are most
16:04
important because let me tell you when you think that you're gonna get you know
16:10
ten books written next year you put all these things on your schedule like oh
16:16
I'm gonna write that sci-fi always wanted to write and I'm going to write a romance and then I think I'm gonna write these two short stories and I'm gonna do
16:22
this and we just daydream about all the different things we're gonna write in a year and instead of sticking to a
16:28
powerful strategy that is gonna be okay I'm going to write these four books in this one series and really putting
16:35
yourself like in a place where you're setting yourself up for success especially I'm especially on this part
16:41
talking to people who want to have a career in writing if you're here and you're just writing right now without the thought of having a career the self
16:48
negative self-talk really applies but for this second piece it really really is so important if you're actually
16:54
looking to make money writing instead of thinking I'm gonna write these ten books and I'm going to you know have all of
17:03
these different genres that I'm gonna write you know oh yeah I'll get my four series books done but I'm also gonna
17:08
write these other five things then what happens is you get to the end of the year and you wrote like one you maybe
17:14
you wrote three books but they're all in different series all in different genres and if you've watched my videos before
17:20
on how to write a best-selling series you'll know that especially when it comes to indie publishing it is very
17:27
difficult I won't say impossible because there's always outliers out there and people have different experiences but it
17:32
is very difficult to make money as an indie author if you are publishing in
17:38
multiple genres before you get what I call an anchor series so if you have not
17:44
watched some of those old videos of mine go back and watch that and you'll see what I mean about wanting to keep your
17:50
writing projects within a schedule but when you're realistic about your time that you have you're gonna focus in it
17:58
forces you to focus on the most important things and sometimes it's gonna be difficult you're gonna have to make tough choices when you go through
18:04
this work book you might have to make tough choices because realistically you might realize I'm only going to be able
18:10
to write two books next year and then you're gonna have to choose from all those amazing ideas that you have which
18:15
are the most important two books that you want to work on next year and that can be really really tough to do so what
18:21
I'm asking you to do is not easy but it's going to help you become more powerful and more focused I love it oh
18:28
gosh how do you say your name evil evil line you evil look I don't know I don't
18:33
know I love your name though but focus is my word I posit focus should be my word next year I totally agree I think that focus is a really good word I'm
18:41
thinking of maybe using the word intention like an intentional I'm still
18:46
working on my word for next year but before we get into the process for the
18:53
planning I'm going to just tell you one more little thing about my life and some
18:58
of you may have heard this before if you've heard me speak or you've seen some of my previous videos but this is something that super applies so this is
19:07
where I have to get real about my own faults but for many years especially after I started actually making money
19:15
and having this is like money that I relied on in my income I would set
19:20
myself up at the you know end of the year every year and I would go to Google Calendar and I would print out 12 all 12
19:29
months calendar blank calendars and I would sit there with all my different color pins and highlighters you know I've got
19:35
I've got all the different colors and I would plan my writing schedule for the year and instead of being super
19:43
realistic and going through the process that I'm going to show you today I would it was like an alien would take over my
19:50
body and I would suddenly be like I'm going to have the best year of my life and I'm gonna like if my daily average
19:57
just 2,000 words a day I'm gonna own it and I'm gonna write 5,000 words every single day and I'm gonna write 900,000
20:03
words this year and I am not even kidding guys I would I would be like my best year I've ever had as 140 thousand
20:09
words which really is an awesome year I'm gonna blow it out of the water I'm going to write nine hundred thousand
20:14
words next year and so I would plan out this whole schedule I'm gonna release
20:20
this book here and I wouldn't take any time off between books I would be like I'm gonna finish this book on Friday I'm gonna start the next one on Saturday and
20:26
I would just put this crazy expectation on myself because I wanted success so
20:34
badly that I thought the only way to get there was to plan this ridiculous
20:39
schedule and I would tell myself that story the only way you're gonna get there Sarah is to write as fast as you
20:44
can't push yourself as hard as you can and all of that came from
20:50
yes very stressful all that stuff came from fear fear that I wasn't good enough
20:55
fear that what I was doing wasn't enough and what would happen every single time
21:02
I did this for like three years in a row and what would happen every single time is that I would get to somewhere around
21:11
January 10th and I would already be so far behind that I was gonna have to push
21:17
the schedule book back because I was expecting myself to do so much in such a short period of time that my whole year
21:24
would already be messed up by January 10th so instead of just throwing my
21:29
schedule out and being like okay I'm gonna give myself the time that I need and being peaceful and you know trying
21:34
to hit my goals at that point you know what I would do I would go back to Google Calendar I would print out 12
21:41
more blank documents and this time instead of being super realistic about my time
21:46
I would say okay well now I'm behind so instead of writing 5,000 words a day I've got to write six thousand words a
21:53
day to catch up well that I mean I look back on it now and I'm like well that
21:58
was the dumbest thing I ever did but I told myself this story that if I don't push myself to have the best biggest
22:05
most amazing year but I don't push myself to be an a completely different person than I am right now
22:11
then I am never gonna have the success that I want and so the whole year I would fall behind and behind and instead
22:18
of feeling powerful and realistic and excited about my goals and checking them off and feeling really good I would feel
22:27
negative behind depressed lazy frustrated and I would blame myself for
22:34
every single day that I didn't get the work done and as you can imagine and as
22:39
some of you probably know when you're feeling down and depressed and you're
22:45
feeling like you're not achieving your goals is it easy to write no it is not
22:52
easy to write it is definitely not easy to write the more you get down on yourself
22:57
the harder it is to be creative and I made a choice when I pushed myself to
23:05
such of a limit that I yeah Casey says went into a several year writing black
23:11
hole that's exactly what I did it was almost it was a full year and a half where I did almost no writing I watched
23:17
a lot of Investigation Discovery a lot of true-crime documentaries I ate a lot of food binge food and I just couldn't
23:25
write because I have pushed myself to a limit and I had almost convinced myself
23:30
that I was just never going to be the writer that I wanted to be so when I
23:37
finally came out of my investigation discovery haze and decided to get my
23:42
life together I started putting together a plan and this is the plan that has
23:47
evolved into my 90-day planning if you've seen my videos on the Kanban board and my planner and this bootcamp
23:54
and all these things that I put together as well as the process that I'm gonna walk you guys through today that has
24:01
helped me I mean telling you transformed my life and because of it I am happier
24:08
and it's a crazy thing that happens when you actually just take a realistic look
24:14
at your schedule and you stop expecting yourself to be superwoman or Wonder Woman at every turn or to be your number
24:21
one best self x ten at every every single day and you'd be realistic about hey sometimes we have bad days sometimes
24:28
we have you know sick days being lista Cubao t' you know how much time we need
24:33
after a writing conference or you know like I saw Marissa movie on here which I
24:39
love her YouTube channel you guys to check her out if you have not yet but she has a video coming out like every
24:47
single day of prep Tober then she's got a video I think coming out every day for vlogmas is that right Marissa if you're
24:52
still here so you know hey it's got to be a little bit tough to be putting out
24:58
a video every single day if that's your plan and writing 2,000 words a day so someone like Marissa might have to if
25:05
she really wants to follow through on this goal of you know videoing every single day she might have to cut back
25:11
realistically on her writing schedule I don't know about Marissa for sure she can chime in if she wants but just
25:17
saying like sometimes you have to be realistic about what you're capable of instead of expecting yourself to be like
25:23
max capacity 365 days of the year because it's just not realistic and when I stepped into
25:29
this powerful oh she says I totally cut back on writing for video and it's it's just a
25:35
truth it's like whenever you decide to do one thing you're deciding not to do another you decide to go to a writing
25:40
conference you're deciding not to probably write that week whenever you decide to go to the beach with your
25:45
family you're deciding not to have as much writing but those things are important too so when we look
25:52
realistically at our schedule we're going to look at all these things in just a minute and I'm gonna walk you guys through this process but when I
25:59
stepped back into a place of like powerful this is
26:05
the schedule that I can stick to I know I can do it I'm going to really intentionally plan I have had the single
26:14
most productive year of my life and it's not just because of the planning it's
26:20
because the joy that comes from not
26:25
constantly telling myself that I'm behind and not constantly feeling like I'm in panic it sort of opens up your
26:31
heart to say you know when you embrace every single day feeling like you're in control of your schedule it is magical
26:37
how much you can get done so with that being said my own personal little experience there I'm going to just
26:44
briefly kind of walk you guys through this process Theresa says I don't
26:49
remember what it feels like to not be behind and I completely understand what you're feeling and you know these these
26:58
courses this type of thing going through this process it's not going to like change your life overnight or maybe it
27:05
will but if you keep working this process of planning things out being realistic being mindful and being kind
27:12
to yourself is going to transform not only your writing career but your life I promise you one of the things that
27:19
people just don't tell you is that being a successful writer is like 80% about mindset and if you cannot get your mind
27:27
in the right place it is going to be very difficult to have a truly long term
27:32
career because there's a lot of things that are going to come your way that are going to try to bring you down like feeling like you're behind you know
27:39
discouragement when you can't get your you know your next publishing deal or however many sales you got are bad
27:46
reviews on your books it's gonna happen to all of us so the stronger you can get and the more pressure and stress you can
27:52
take off of yourself in your day-to-day living your day-to-day schedule the better off you're going to be all right
27:58
so let's talk a little bit about this writing schedule workbook so Claire says
28:04
can the workbook be printed in a5 size I have not tried to print it and I only made it for the letter size because I
28:10
just didn't have time to resize it let me get back to you on that Claire I'm
28:16
I'll try printing it myself and see if you can like fit to page and make it work it may not be exactly the right
28:22
dimensions but we'll see it may not be that difficult for me to resize it I'll let you know but for now it's in letter
28:29
version now if you've downloaded this already you'll see that there are pages and pages of explanation which I'm not
28:35
going to walk you through all that but you can read it on your own but it kind of talks about why to do this like we
28:42
talked about but the actual step-by-step process that you're going to use when you go and grab this download is number
28:49
one what I have no you don't have to follow along Melissa I'm just gonna kind
28:55
of explain it to you and then later you like when the broadcast is over you can go and download it and use it for
29:01
yourself or if you don't want to grab the download you you can kind of listen to my explanation you can just print
29:06
your own calendar to do it it's a pretty easy system but it's so powerful so I'm just going to show you guys really
29:12
quickly for those of you that have not downloaded it so I'm not sure how well you can see this but in and it's
29:20
backwards I think but in this download you have little mini calendars like this
29:25
for every single month of the year and so what we're gonna do is we're going to
29:31
realistically look at your time for 2019 and we're going to kind of sketch out
29:37
your writing plan now everybody who goes through this is potentially going to be in a different place so some of you that
29:45
are watching maybe you've never written a novel before or you've started books but you've never finished something some
29:52
of you watching may have finished 40 or 50 books and be publishing and you know hitting the New York Times so and a lot
29:58
of us are gonna be somewhere in between right so I knew eventually I was gonna
30:04
get some kind of bad comment we'll see how do i okay I'm hiding that user so
30:12
hopefully you won't be let's say that apparently YouTube blogs always get some kind of like bad comments so we will
30:19
just ignore that person okay so what you're going to do is when you print this out you're going to have a full
30:27
kind of mini calendar for every single month of the year all 12 months and you're gonna go through this
30:32
system of realistically looking every time so yeah there's always somebody I
30:37
knew it would happen but I think I know now how to get rid of them so first step
30:43
is you're gonna look at your entire calendar for 2019 and guess what guys
30:48
this for those of you who are planners like me this is your chance to grab some color-coded pens and it is going to be
30:55
amazing and it's you know you know you're you've made it when the purse start bugging you yes it is sad but true
31:01
I have arrived I'm much more excited about the fact that there are almost 150 people here live I'm so grateful to you
31:08
guys y'all are awesome so this is your chance to like actually pull out some color-coded pens which is super super
31:15
awesome so it's like a chance to actually like play with our stationery which is great so what I want you to do
31:22
first step one when you get your calendar is you are going to mark off
31:28
every single day next year that you will probably not be writing and this is
31:34
where some of us get ourselves into trouble because we think that oh I'll
31:42
write on Christmas Day I mean maybe I never have before but I could do that I mean you know I used to tell myself
31:48
things like well I've got this whole week that I'm gonna be gone for this rwa conference but I'm going to take my
31:53
laptop and I'm gonna write in the evenings and then every year I would go and get zero writing done so this when
32:00
you're going through the schedule this is not a time to imagine that you're gonna do things you've never done before
32:05
like you're gonna be oh well we're going on a two-week vacation to Florida but I'm gonna take my laptop and I'm gonna
32:12
write 40 thousand words like don't put yourself in that position this is the time to be realistic if you are not
32:18
someone who typically goes on vacation and gets a lot of writing done then don't expect yourself to do it this year
32:25
if you end up actually doing it this year then it's just bonus words right oh
32:30
I love lip in my favorite oh I think you posted a picture of those two
32:36
very cool so what you need to do is
32:41
you're gonna go through your schedule and you're gonna mark off all those things so mark off if you know holidays
32:48
and yes who let me see it's going by quickly Lori says I hear other authors
32:54
saying that they write every day and I have I know friends I have friends that do write every single day it's like
33:00
Christmas Day they're still posting in a group saying I got 5,000 words today and that is great if that is you then count
33:06
those days there's no judgement here there's no comparison just be yourself
33:11
know what you do oh hey Brenna yes you can it'll be on replay after the
33:18
workshop is over so the first thing you have to do is be a realistic look over the entire calendar that I've given you
33:24
and just mark off those days that you won't be working you can either like blackout through them or you can put
33:32
washi tape over them if you wanted to whatever you want to do but just mark off those days it can be a slash through
33:37
the day or whatever holidays vacations I
33:43
have days that are I'm going to talk about that Tamron that'll be step two so
33:49
Amy says does this include your day job so it depends for you if you write on
33:54
days that you work so this will be very very personal to you if you have a day
33:59
job and let's say you work Monday through Friday and you cannot spare any
34:05
time for writing in the evenings because you've got a family you've got everything else so weekends are your only days - right then mark off every
34:11
single day that is not a weekend and you know this is sometimes it's painful to
34:17
look at our writing schedule realistically sometimes that's what we have to do you need to be like specific
34:25
about your own schedule but if you write you work from say 8 a.m. and you get
34:31
home at 5:30 and you always try to write 30 minutes at the end of the day when
34:36
you get home then you don't mark those days off you leave those as working days and we to talk about the estimate of time in
34:44
terms of how many words you can do per day in step 3 so if there's you're not
34:49
going to get any writing done that day at all like no writing no editing no publishing tasks it's not a working day
34:56
for you when it comes to your writing mark that day off and we're going to talk about editing specifically and so
35:03
on in like step 3 but for now if it's like I call them working days if it's
35:08
not a working day so you're not going to be working on any kind of tasks you
35:13
won't be plotting you won't be writing no writing is getting done then mark
35:18
that day off as an on writing day so one
35:24
thing to keep in mind when you're going through this part and I kind of you'll when you go through and you read this I kind of touch on this a little bit as
35:30
well that you might end up saying like
35:36
let's say you have a conference or I'll tell you I just booked a flight to LA in
35:41
January so I'll be flying out to LA on January 8th and I'll be gone until the 12th for a business conference and I
35:49
already know that it's not just going to be you know those four days that I'll be
35:55
not writing on the seventh I'm probably not going to write either because I'm gonna be packing I'm gonna be getting
36:01
ready for the conference I'm gonna be you know making sure everything's set up double-checking my airfare I'm probably
36:06
not gonna be writing I also know that on that Sunday the 13th I'm probably not gonna be running that day either because
36:12
I'm gonna be coming home from an eight-hour flight in four days of like being an extrovert and I'm gonna just
36:19
need a day to chill so on my schedule I'm not just going to write off the
36:24
eight to the twelve I'm gonna write off the seven to the thirteenth so some of this will be something that you'll learn
36:31
over time as you become more aware of this and some of it you're just gonna use your past experience so like for
36:37
example if you know your birthday is September 12th and you never work on
36:43
your birthday week then mark that entire week off if you know that your family is
36:48
going on vacation for July 4th and you'll be gone for four days but it's take you usually two or three days to
36:53
pack everything and get it ready then you need to mark off the three days before as well so this is where you get
36:59
super super realistic of exactly what days you're gonna mark off so this is
37:05
things that are already on your calendar vacations any kind of holidays that you
37:10
don't plan on having any kind of work done I like to also mark off about a
37:16
week at the end of December because I know I'm going to be planning for the next year so anything like that that you
37:22
know you're gonna do you'll mark it off step 2 is where we deal with unexpected events
37:27
somebody asked about this a little while like what about things that come up so in step two what you're going to do is
37:34
you're going to mark off oh actually let me go let me reel it back just a second
37:40
so when you go through and you mark off all the days what I want you to do is I want you to count up how many days you
37:47
marked off and there's a place for you to put it in to this sheet you'll see it
37:53
right here so you'll take 365 days - however many days you marked off so
37:59
let's just say you March 20 days office like I'm not writing these 20 days of the year yours is probably going to be a
38:05
lot more than 20 but I'm just using that as the number so then you'll write in the total days remaining is 340 days of
38:12
work time next year so that would give you a good estimate of how many days
38:17
that you you know actually have to work next year based on your schedule but
38:23
we're gonna take it a step further in step two and like I said you can take notes if you want but I have all of this
38:29
stuff detailed out for you in the handout as well so step two now that you
38:35
have all of your vacations and obligations and everything marked off in step two what you're going to do is you're going to estimate about how much
38:43
time on average you need for unexpected things that come up so the kind of
38:48
things like obviously there's no way we can know because we don't have a crystal ball to say oh you know you're going to
38:55
get the flu this year or whatever but we're just going to estimate you can look back at 2018 and kind of get a good
39:01
estimate of how much time you've got you know for year but this is where you're gonna
39:06
estimate how many days do you think you need on average for the year or for each
39:11
month for your children getting sick how many times a year do they probably get
39:16
sick that maybe you can't work or days when you've got to deal with something
39:22
with your pets that you've got going on or how often do you get sick and this is
39:28
going to be different for everybody like my husband has allergy problems so he's sick several times a year from allergies
39:33
how often do you have migraine headaches how often do you just have bla days
39:40
where you just don't feel like writing I put in at least three days a month that
39:45
I know I'm just not gonna write not because I have an obligation or because I have a headache but just because I
39:50
don't feel like writing and I always come across it it's a melancholy thing maybe it's hormonal but it just is
39:57
always on average three days a month when I'm not going to write so I count those days off as it is so then what
40:05
you'll do is there's a section in the workbook where you can write in what reasons you're taking off so you can
40:12
write like you know for family health emergencies I'm going to take 10 days off next year for you know bla days I'm
40:20
going to take three days a month so that means 36 days I'm going to take off next year for that then you add up all those
40:28
like unexpected days and you give yourself an estimate and you put it in this box at the bottom does anybody have
40:35
any questions about that it'll make more sense when you actually see it now of
40:40
course that's harder to put on a calendar because you can't really say
40:47
you can't really say well I'm gonna be sick on January 10th right you can't
40:54
really know when you're gonna need those breaks so it's harder to put on the calendar but what I want you to do is get that number so let's say you're
41:01
gonna take an additional 40 days off next year for unexpected things or mental health days or illnesses or
41:07
whatever so you had 365 days to begin with you took 20 off for your
41:13
obligations and to 345 days then you take another would
41:21
I say 40 days off so now you're down to 305 days so yes and it is it is funny how we
41:28
forget to take days off in our writing lives like most people working regular jobs take weekends off they take
41:34
vacations and they don't work but as writers we kind of are always working in a way and it once you become a paid
41:41
writer a published writer it gets worse and worse and worse because you have lots of other things to do so this is
41:48
super important to give yourself that time to understand there's just gonna be days when you don't write because you cannot realistically look at your
41:54
schedule for next year and what you're gonna get done if you don't give
42:01
yourself those migraine days those mental health days those days off when
42:06
you're at conference or those days off for Christmas or whatever it is in your life that you need that so what you'll
42:13
do at the end of step 2 is you'll take the days remaining from step 1 in our example we have 345 days then you'll
42:19
subtract the days that you just estimated you would need off for step two which I've estimated at 40 and now
42:25
you're down to 305 days of working days for the year and I have this little calendar note here because these are
42:32
unexpected things you can't know where you're gonna place them on your schedule so what you can do instead this is kind
42:38
of up to you okay Bethenny this is kind of up to you that you can either go to
42:45
like December 31st and mark off 40 days just see kind of get an idea of your
42:50
calendar or let's say you have 40 days you can kind of do like 40 days divided by 12 months I'm gonna take you know 3
42:59
days off of the beginning of every month but the key is that you need to account
43:04
for these 40 days somewhere in your schedule even though it's not actually going to be the days that you're sick
43:10
does that make sense I really tried to explain this in the process here but let if you have to
43:17
let's say 40 days set aside for unexpected events what I like to do is I'll go to the very end of December 31st
43:24
and I'll just mark off the 40 like days available from the those are not I'm not gonna get sick all
43:31
40 days at the end but it gives me an idea when I'm setting up how much I can get done in a year of exactly what I
43:37
want to do so hopefully that will make sense and like I said if you don't want to cluster all 40 of those days or
43:44
whatever at the end of the month just add them to the beginning of each month to kind of give you an idea of not
43:50
exactly the days that you're gonna be sick but it gives you an idea of how many working days you have every month
43:56
of the year so yeah yeah Deborah she says it makes sense I need to do this for my day job schedule this can really that's why I
44:02
said it's good for writers but it's really good for anyone trying to like set goals or manage their time so
44:07
Melissa says when you add these extra days to your calendar and then adjust your daily work count needed and you
44:13
don't end up needing those days you end up ahead of your own count expectation yes exactly so if you estimated 40 days and then hey
44:22
you know what you actually didn't take those mental health days you could end up ahead this year I mean how good would
44:30
that feel to be like September and you've already like hit all your writing goals cuz then guess what now you get to
44:36
write some extra projects next year that would feel so much better wouldn't it than like getting to January 13th and
44:42
being like well I'm already behind in my whole schedule of screwed it makes so
44:47
much sense this is a way that you set yourself up for being ahead and just I
44:53
mean I don't know about you but that just makes my heart feel like I like excited and motivated and light and
45:01
trust me is this like save it's like a savings account was what you're doing you're giving yourself the room and the
45:07
space to take days off when you don't feel like it or to have sick days without panicking it's very powerful
45:12
thing so once you've done those first two steps and you have your estimated
45:20
number of workdays for the year you're going to move on to step three so this
45:25
is where it gets a little bit trickier and there might be more questions so if you go through this process later
45:32
tonight or you know some time before the beginning of the year and you think okay I need clarification of this don't
45:37
hesitate to send me an email or a message or something my email sara SAR
45:43
ra at heart breathing's calm and i will help answer your questions because it'll make more sense when you're actually going through it but i'm just gonna kind
45:49
of give you a little walkthrough so where this gets trickier is because it's going to be specific to each one of you
45:58
that are filling this out and there's no way that i can tell you some of you like i said have been writing for years
46:04
you finished twenty novels you've got your system down you know exactly how many days it takes you to write a book
46:09
or how many days it takes you to edit and those people who know how long it
46:14
takes them and they're able to stick to a schedule it's gonna be a lot easier for you to estimate how much time it
46:20
takes you to complete a project but for those of us who you know one project might take three weeks and another
46:27
project might take six months or if you've never finished a novel before and you're still working on finishing that
46:33
first one it might be a little bit more difficult to you so you're gonna have to work with just your best guess estimates
46:40
and i would encourage you as you are estimating your projects for the year
46:46
under estimate lori even if you finished a bunch of books you still feel clueless
46:52
yes that is very true i feel that way most of the time i'm like uh how am i am i gonna be able to finish this by the
46:58
end of the year i don't know we'll see but i will say after following this
47:03
process for this entire year for the first time in my entire life and career
47:09
of eight years indie publishing this is the first year that i finished every single book that i said i was going to
47:14
finish except one and i am working on it i am determined to finish it by the 31st
47:20
so that is a powerful thing for someone who never ever ever could do it so take
47:28
it from me this system works it just might take you some time to estimate exactly how many you need to do like how
47:34
much days you need to finish each thing so we're aiming for our best guess we're
47:41
aiming for being realistic in terms of how many words you can write next year
47:47
we're not you missed a lot so make sure that you go in and you can watch it from the
47:53
beginning but we're basically talking about this process of choosing how much
47:58
time and deciding how much time so now what we're working on is which projects
48:04
you're going to work on in 2019 so yeah
48:10
how many of you actually this will be a good question how many of you know already how many of you that are here
48:16
now know what your average word count is per hour not you're like you you're high
48:23
on three Red Bulls and you've got like techno but beating in the background like best word count of all time but
48:30
like what is your average on any random day like what's your average word count
48:39
my average word count I figure out so
48:44
Claire knows 1500 per hour 75 words per minute 1,200 per hour it depends on the
48:50
hour yes Brenna I know but average we're going average a thousand a thousand one hundred and eighty two thousand three
48:56
hundred words per sprint so it kind of depends how many Sprint's you can do in an hour nine hundred words draft a chapter in 25
49:03
minutes so a lot of you know and some of you don't know if you are someone who
49:10
does not know how many words you can do in an hour so Bethenny says I'm not sure per hour
49:17
but per day I can do to Kate comfortably for a couple of weeks so that's good -
49:23
no - like per day and it's fine if all you know is a per day instead of a per hour some people know about five hundred nine
49:30
hundred two thousand 1800 an hour if you are one of the people here who does not
49:35
know your average word count one thing that you can do over the next few days is do a couple of writing sprints and so
49:42
I've talked about this before because it's one of my favorite things to do it's like set a timer for 25 minutes and
49:48
just sit and write for 25 minutes and when the alarm goes off check your word count so you got to
49:54
check your words when you start how many words did you have at the beginning versus how many words you have at the end and then subtract and you'll find
50:01
out what how many words you add into your manuscript this 25 minutes then take a five-minute break and do it again
50:08
and then take a five-minute break into it again and then come back tomorrow and
50:14
do it again and do a couple of days to you know figure out what your average is
50:21
and you may have some sprints that you get 500 you may have some Sprint's that you only got 150 so take the entire bit
50:30
of you're like three days of sprinting divide it by the number of Sprint's that you did and get your average number per
50:36
sprint and that will give you your average per 25 minutes if that's the
50:41
increment you used and you know you can get two of those Sprint's done in an hour so let's say your average was 300
50:47
then that means you multiply it by two and you get an average per hour of 600
50:53
Sprint's does that make sense hopefully yes I explained it well Theresa I use an android app called
50:59
write ometer it's just the word write with o meter at the end of it it's my favorite I don't know if there's a
51:06
corresponding kind of iPhone app but I
51:11
use that but you can use any Pomodoro timer will work for you you just can't
51:18
always put your word count in so you might need a notebook or a planner to put your word count in so just saying
51:24
you know what Alice somebody told me that they thought maybe it was taken down and I still have it maybe because I
51:31
downloaded it before but it's possible maybe they're like revamping it so if you don't see it it might be off the
51:37
market I'm not 100% sure so yeah so you could boo Joe Ubu Joe your trackers in
51:43
my planner there's also us brent tracker if you end up downloading my HP 90
51:49
method 90 day planner yes Lori says she uses the word count tracker for my Etsy store so you guys can you know find that
51:56
at the end of the planner so you can use that if you like but figure out what your average words per hour or your
52:02
average words per day and then what you're going to do is you're going to look at all the days that you have
52:08
laughs so in our example we had 305 days and we're going to what you don't want
52:14
to do this is what I did for a while as I said oh I can write 2,000 words a day I've got three hundred and five days to
52:20
work so that means I can write three hundred five times two thousand haha
52:25
well that is not taking into account what you've got to edit this book you've
52:32
got to publish it you've got all these other tasks that have to happen and even if you're not at a stage where you're
52:38
ready to publish it do you have to actually edit that book and if you're like me you will find yes revision
52:45
editing in promo brenes is from one of our best-selling authors that's watching here yes you've got a lot of other
52:51
things that you have to do besides just the writing of the book some people are
52:57
gonna go through several revisions wraps before it's even ready to go out to an editor also for me I have to take into
53:03
account that as much as I would love to be the kind of person that you know
53:09
finishes a book on Sunday and starts a brand new one on Monday I just have not gotten to a point where I'm capable of
53:16
doing that I always end up needing at least a week or two off completely between books so if like I said if you
53:24
have not finished books yet you might need to you know pay really close
53:29
attention to how things are going for you this year if you find out you know
53:34
pay attention to your habits pay attention to what you need if you need two weeks off or a month off in between
53:40
writing your rough draft and doing your edits then when you figure out your schedule for 2020 you're going to take
53:46
that into consideration so if this is your first year planning in this way you might not be perfect at it you know what
53:52
that's okay but you're gonna be one step closer to being where you want to be and then next year the following year you'll
53:58
be even closer because you'll have more information so step three is all about
54:03
actually going into the calendar where you have all these days that are already marked off and start planning out your
54:12
projects so this is kind of a fun part but this is where you have to really be careful not to overestimate what you can
54:20
do and remember when you and you do this process which I'm going to kind of walk you through and I'm not
54:27
gonna go over this super in detail but like I said if you meant if you get through this process for yourself once
54:32
you download this and you are lost just reach out to me and I can do maybe another live before the end of the year
54:39
or another video kind of clarifying if there are a lot of questions that come in but you definitely want to count off
54:48
like any day that you have marked off you're not gonna count that as working day remember because you've marked that office this is a day that I'm not
54:54
working so let's say you move on I'm not sure if you guys will be able to see this very well on the video plus it's
55:01
backwards but you kind of get an idea that I have a little project for you in this download where you are going to be
55:08
able to write the name of the project and then I've got the different stages of the project for you on one side and
55:16
then on the right side you have an estimated number of days that you think it will take you to complete that stage
55:22
of the process so let's say for example for most of us for many of us project
55:27
one of next year might not be a brand-new project how many of you who
55:33
are watching live oh it's not backwards for you guys it's backwards on mine
55:39
like when I look at it but maybe it flips it for you guys well that's good to know okay so how many of you are going to be
55:46
starting a brand-new project like from scratch in January January 1st and how
55:53
many of you are carrying over to like finish a previous project in January I will be finishing a project I'll
56:00
probably be in edits I hope I'm praying that I'm gonna finish this book in rough draft and I'll be working on edits so
56:06
Leeanne says both so a new project and carrying over a lot of people carrying
56:11
over Christy just says nope I'm not sure now my me note not starting something
56:16
new carrying something over editing your nano book yeah a lot of people so both so that's another thing to keep in mind
56:24
when you're going through your different projects is that some of these things might overlap so if you know your
56:30
process and you know that you can be drafting a book here while also working on Publishing or revising a different book
56:36
then you don't have to like you can kind of double count those days but for most of us we'll only got that one kind of
56:42
writing tasks so make it work for you there are no rules here except that I want you to be realistic so a lot of
56:49
people are starting new books and a lot of people are carrying over so it kind of depends carrying over carrying over
56:57
so a lot of us are carrying over so the process the parts of the process that I have labeled for you in this project box
57:04
are plotting your rough draft your edits and by that I mean your self edits the
57:10
stuff you're actually going to do and if you want to you can actually add on days for like let's say you sit look out to
57:17
your editor and then two weeks three weeks later they send it back to you and you know it'll take you about three days
57:23
to go through their edits and like apply them to your book and then you send it to beta readers and you're gonna take you another week go ahead and add that
57:29
and count all of those different parts of your editing process as days you need to edit and then publishing so plotting
57:36
rough draft editing and publishing if one of these stages does not apply to
57:43
you so for example you are not in the publishing process yet you're just not
57:51
don't count it just mark it off no big deal right this is not a time for you to
57:56
be like super specific about oh I've got to follow these rules or exactly what Sara says in here you're not in the
58:02
publishing phase just cross it off no big deal if you don't plot for example
58:07
and all you do is like write down a few ideas and you pants then just mark the plots so if something doesn't apply to
58:13
you don't count it if there's something I didn't include on here that you need time for add it in make it work for you
58:21
but let's say project one if you're carrying over a previous project like I
58:28
will be in a lot of you are going to be carrying something over you will count that as project one of the year because
58:33
you're still gonna have some part of these stages so for me let's say project 1 would be paid surrender the plot is
58:39
done the rough draft will be done by 31st mark my words so I will be in edit
58:45
so let's say I know I need 21 days to edit my book and that
58:51
includes days as the beta readers get it back to me and so on let's just give that an average say 21 days what I would
58:58
do at that point is I would go back to the end of this workbook to my January
59:05
box and I would find the first available working day and I would start counting
59:11
my working days only 21 days so for
59:17
example let's say on my sheet I had the first and the second and the third
59:22
marked off so you can kind of see that let's say I had those days marked off because my sister is gonna be here so I
59:29
would begin counting my 21 days on the 4th and usually what I will do is I will
59:34
assign a color so this is like a greenish teal color let's say this is my color for faith surrender in every book
59:41
or every project has a different color then I would start actually counting the
59:47
number of days and I personally like to number them out so for example if you
59:53
guys can see this I would start numbering them day here's my first day my second day third day fourth day fifth
59:59
day six day of edits and I would keep going until I got to 21 and if there was
1:00:05
any day in between that was a marked off day like if it was in this way I hit day
1:00:12
6 good that all can't get it to focus quite quite maybe if I put the pin in
1:00:18
next to it if I get to day 6 and then these two are not working days I can't
1:00:24
count this as day 7 I would have to just gloss over those and then move to this
1:00:29
day as day 7 does this make sense I'm
1:00:34
gonna address that question Deborah in just a second so I would count up until
1:00:41
I have 21 days and that would be my average estimate of how much time I need
1:00:46
to edit then I would go to the next stage in process and I would say when we
1:00:51
friend the rate sheet I would say okay once my edits are done how many days do
1:00:58
I need for publishing and what I want you to remember here is
1:01:04
that we're not actually so much setting our schedule like the actual days
1:01:11
because remember like I said you don't know which days you're gonna get sick you don't know which days your son is gonna need you or you're gonna have to
1:01:17
take the dog to the emergency vet you know whatever you don't know so this is not necessarily saying this book's gonna
1:01:23
get published on January 12 or whatever but this will give you an estimate of how much you can get done in the next
1:01:30
year are you guys with me on that because this will give you that estimate of how much time you need and it's less
1:01:36
about the actual dates and more about which projects you can complete in the year because I have found for me
1:01:43
personally it is more important because if I set a day and I say well this books
1:01:49
coming out February 12th I'm usually not gonna hit it so the date isn't as
1:01:54
important on my writing schedule as knowing this book is getting done and it will be published next year give
1:01:59
yourself that freedom instead of feeling like it's got to be done by this date now sometimes we do have to actually
1:02:06
like schedule out our editors in advance and that kind of thing so if you guys want to see more videos about sort of
1:02:13
how to plan in advance for your editors and work your schedule in to actual publishing dates let me know and I can
1:02:20
talk about that a little bit more specifically because sometimes when you are self-publishing you have to hire your own editors you have to have them
1:02:28
booked months and months in advance and a lot of editors will give you some leeway like okay it's not done today but
1:02:34
you're gonna get it to them in a week and that's fine but some editors if you missed that date they just can't fit you
1:02:42
in anymore and you got to find somebody else so yes Kristy set yourself up for accomplishment super super important so
1:02:50
this particular style of planning here is you know is much more about figuring
1:02:57
out how many things you can do next year and less about exactly which dates they're getting done and once you've
1:03:05
gone through this process you might be able to kind of tweak your exact dates but I would say like if you think you're
1:03:11
going to be with your first project by March 12 then give yourself an additional two weeks
1:03:17
time before you book that editor just give yourself time so yeah see I definitely see a couple of people saying
1:03:24
yes they love a video on editor so I'm gonna add that to my list for next year so let's say I did the 21 days for edits
1:03:31
and now I need to figure out how many days for publishing so because I am a publishing author I'm gonna need to
1:03:36
figure out how many days do I need to take off from doing other things like
1:03:42
writing to work on the publishing and promoting of this book so let's say on
1:03:47
average I'm going to take a full week so I'm gonna take seven days so then what I would do is I would go to my calendar
1:03:53
and I would count out the next seven days after the 20th now this is where I
1:03:59
said things get a little bit tricky because it's going to depend on your
1:04:04
process and if you finish a rough draft and you have like three weeks off before
1:04:12
you like to tackle your edits it's just a personal thing do you want to work on plotting your second project while that
1:04:19
other book is just resting or do you just need those three weeks off be realistic about what you need and then
1:04:28
apply it to the count or the way you need it and you know that's really the best I can do without knowing
1:04:34
everybody's situation but hopefully that doesn't make sense and give you a little bit of guidance but if you if you get it
1:04:40
to the end of your edits and you're like okay I need three weeks off you've got
1:04:46
to give yourself those three weeks and you need to be realistic about whether you're gonna be working on another project during those three weeks or not
1:04:52
so hopefully that does make sense let's see Denali says what if we plan on starting our anchor series but want to
1:04:59
hold back the first three books before publishing should we get each book edited as we go or wait and edit the first three all at once so it kind of
1:05:06
depends but I think that it depends on your timeline but it also depends on
1:05:13
whether or not you're writing the kind of series that would benefit from you putting in plants and reveals as you go
1:05:20
if that makes sense if you get to book three and you realize oh I could have put a
1:05:27
little clue about this in book 1 then maybe you want to just write all three
1:05:32
rough drafts and then go back to edit and it kind of depends on the type of
1:05:40
series that you're writing the way you want to write it Christy makes a good point that if you if you write the first
1:05:45
one go ahead and send it out to your editor then you've at least got your expenses are being kind of instead of
1:05:51
that huge bill that you're gonna get for editing three books at once you could have them kind of spread out a little
1:05:58
bit more but it also depends how deep of an edit you're getting are you getting a content edit are you getting a copy edit
1:06:04
or if you're just getting a proofread so it kind of depends so I think I'll have to do another video on editing so
1:06:11
alright so the my novel was resting and I have two people reading it so you
1:06:17
might have beta readers or other people reading it and then the question you need to ask yourself is will I be working on other stuff while that novel
1:06:24
is resting and if the answer is no and you just yourself you're resting then you have to just mark those off as not working days but if you are going to be
1:06:31
plotting then what you could do is you could you know hit your 20 days and then take out your pink pen and you can start
1:06:38
doing like okay well this this is done and I'm gonna start day one is gonna be
1:06:44
you know project this project you know will be in pink so that's the way I like
1:06:50
to do my schedule but like I said it's hard to cover it for a large group of people because everybody's going to kind
1:06:57
of approach it differently but I think as you get into this process and you read my examples and you really
1:07:03
start looking at it how it fits in your life then you will be able to figure it out but if you have questions don't
1:07:10
hesitate to reach out to me I have given you space on the worksheet for nine
1:07:17
projects now before you freak out and go night she's expecting that's right nine books I wanted to make sure there was
1:07:24
enough space for people that are writing short stories novellas shorter works or
1:07:31
there are people out there who are writing nine plus books a year I have a friend who writes ten books a year I
1:07:36
don't know how does that I can't do it I don't try to do it the important thing to remember is that this is not something that I've put
1:07:42
on there to trigger some kind of comparison of say I think I'm kind of
1:07:49
out of focus here focus me this is not like a way to compare yourself to other
1:07:55
people and go oh man look at that means there's people here doing nine like don't let that trigger you there could
1:08:02
be people writing nine ten thousand words short stories it's not about how many projects you're doing it's about
1:08:07
being realistic about yourself this is your journey it belongs to you and don't worry about what anybody else is doing
1:08:13
you may get to these projects and you may only have one next year but if that's the first novel you ever finished
1:08:19
in your life man that is gonna feel good and if you get it done in 2019 then that will be the best year you ever had so
1:08:26
don't let that trigger you let it be your journey your projects don't worry that I'm expecting you to have nine if
1:08:33
you are writing short stories or you just are very prolific and you write more than nine then you can just print
1:08:39
an extra sheet and just hover up the number and like whiteout and renumber those but that is the basic system so
1:08:49
what I want you guys to do is head over to heart breathing's calm slash blog or
1:08:55
if you're on my email list already go download it from your email and download
1:09:02
this workbook it's 17 pages it'll give you this process going through marking
1:09:07
off all your vacation days marking off all the like estimated days that you might need for like mental health
1:09:12
reasons or for unexpected illnesses or just things that pop up like oh gosh the PTA needed me to do this fundraiser and
1:09:19
now I don't have time to write for three days give yourself that time and then go through your schedule estimating how
1:09:26
much time you need now somebody asked the question like if I've never finished a book or edited a book how do I know
1:09:31
how long it's going to take me so I want to address that real quick number one is sorry I'm still trying to
1:09:43
like learn how to like sort of read comments and keep my brain working in the back so if I pause it's just because I'm like
1:09:49
actually got caught on a comment there so anyway number one figure out your
1:09:55
average word count per day or per hour so if you know you you can write an hour a day on your working days and you can
1:10:03
write a thousand words an hour then you know you can write about a thousand words a day then you estimate how much
1:10:11
your rough draft is gonna be I think it's gonna come in around sixty thousand words then you know when you're filling
1:10:18
out your little box here that you're gonna estimate sixty working days or
1:10:23
that you know when you're filling filling this out you'll estimate sixty working days for that project for the
1:10:31
rough draft if you've never gotten to the editing stage then where I would suggest you start it's giving yourself
1:10:38
as much time for edits as you did for the rough draft so if you think it's gonna take you 60 days hey Jasmine if
1:10:45
you think it's gonna take you sixty days to write the rough draft then give yourself sixty days to edit and then
1:10:53
keep track of how long it takes you so what I would do is actually keep track
1:11:00
on this or inside your planner so that as you go and you finished a few
1:11:05
projects you'll start to see you know what it doesn't actually take me sixty days to edit it only takes me 30 days to
1:11:11
edit you'll get a better feel for that as you go right now it's just gonna be a best-guess scenario if you've never
1:11:16
finished or you've never adit it is to guessing game but as a general rule I think if you give yourself the same
1:11:23
amount of time it took you to write the rough draft to do the edits you're gonna be kind of in a safe zone and you may
1:11:29
find later that oh gosh it took me twice as long and that's fine too because at least you learned and now you're more
1:11:35
powerful because you have more information at your fingertips alright so we're going a little bit over an hour
1:11:43
but I before we close up I wanted to just end with this thought
1:11:51
for those of us that constantly say I'm
1:11:58
gonna be my very best I'm gonna have the very best year I've ever had and what that means for us when it translates
1:12:05
into not being realistic is we're you know we want to be different people you
1:12:10
say January 1st I want to be somebody else I want to be the kind of person
1:12:16
that gets up and writes five hours every day or I want to be the kind of person that can write six novels in a year and
1:12:21
it's great to want to improve ourselves it's great to want to be our best
1:12:26
version of ourselves but where the danger comes in especially for those of us who are true creative beings is that
1:12:34
to expect yourself to go from zero to a hundred miles per hour overnight it's
1:12:40
just fear talking it's setting yourself up for failure it's something in the back of your subconscious mind that
1:12:46
saying who you are is not enough and
1:12:52
that's just not true it's a lie you're telling yourself if you truly want to
1:12:58
change your life to change your habits to change your routines to feel more in control where you start is not by
1:13:07
expecting yourself to be the very best person you have ever been and by best
1:13:13
you mean I have to write nine hundred thousand words next year and be like five times my best year ever that is not
1:13:20
how you become enough or a better person the way that you get more done and it
1:13:26
sounds so counterintuitive to the way we usually do things but the way you get more done is to step back and be more
1:13:34
realistic and more deliberate and intentional about the time you actually have set yourself up for success instead
1:13:41
of setting yourself up for failure by the second week of the year trust me trust me trust me on this I think it is
1:13:47
true like a lot of times I say in my opinion I think this is true for all of
1:13:53
us if you want to truly change your life and you're a procrastinator or you're
1:14:00
it's constantly overestimating what you can do in a year one of the best that you can give yourself this holiday
1:14:06
season and this New Year celebration is to be more realistic and more deliberate
1:14:11
about where you're spending your time because when you get realistic and you focus in on the most important things
1:14:19
instead of thinking you can take on the world you actually will get more done because you're not wasting your time
1:14:25
feeling like you're not good enough saying negative things to yourself feeling depressed feeling overwhelmed
1:14:31
when you take that pressure off your shoulders of always feeling overwhelmed or feeling like you can't do it you can
1:14:38
transform your life I promise you this and this is one of the main reasons that
1:14:44
I felt so passionate about starting this channel about speaking to other authors
1:14:50
because I feel like a lot of the average out there like the average or a lot of
1:14:55
the advice out there is people telling you well if you want a career you have
1:15:01
to you have to write super fast you have to push yourself super hard you have to spend all this money on ads you have to
1:15:06
blah blah blah blah and people don't think about it's not success is not just
1:15:12
about writing as many books as you can as fast as you can it is truly about finding a way to be
1:15:21
happy in your life that is what success means to me and we all define it
1:15:27
differently I know but you you're not going to be happy pushing yourself to
1:15:32
the limit and it's not sustainable and take it from someone who burned out and could not do anything the best gift you
1:15:40
can give yourself is to be realistic because you don't wake up on January 1st a different person
1:15:47
you just don't but one of my favorite quotes from Tony Robbins is that he says
1:15:54
most like when you oh I got to get it right hold on he says when you I was on
1:16:01
the roll there and now I forgot I want to get it right because it's so Prince what am i favorite favorite
1:16:07
you know I can't find it aha I got it once you have mastered time
1:16:14
you will understand how true it is that most people overestimate what they can accomplish in a year and underestimate
1:16:21
what they can achieve in a decade this world right now is all about short-term
1:16:26
how many books can I write this year how fast can I get this done how can I make a quick buck how can I do this
1:16:32
but for lasting success in this business lasting success and joy in your life you
1:16:37
have to be thinking long term instead of telling yourself I have to have the most
1:16:45
I've ever done this year to set myself up for this unrealistic goals try giving
1:16:50
yourself going through this system working through this plan and giving yourself a realistic timeframe to finish
1:16:56
these projects and just see at the end of 2019 how it feels to look back and be
1:17:02
like holy cow I just achieved all my goals for the year because as someone
1:17:07
who has actually done it like one of my goals was I really really want to be a
1:17:13
public speaker I want to get out there I want to you know start a YouTube channel I want to you know be asked to speak at
1:17:19
conferences I want to get my message out there is I'm super passionate about it but I also want to write these five
1:17:25
books this year and I want to move my family to Charleston and I had all these things like I always wanted to live on the marsh and you know as someone who
1:17:32
finally after extreme burnout and thinking that I was never going to achieve my goals in life turned around
1:17:39
and said instead of setting myself up for failure and focusing on fear I am going to as often as possible focus on
1:17:46
joy and get out of this feeling that I have to push myself to the max and
1:17:52
instead give myself the space to be creative it transformed my life so I
1:17:58
really really would like to give you that gift as well so head over to heart

hey guys welcome back to my heart
0:02
breathing's Channel I am so excited to
0:04
finally be bringing to you this plotting
0:06
series so today it marks the beginning
0:09
of an eight part series on how to plot
0:12
your novel I'm going to be sharing with
0:14
you all the tips tricks and tools that I
0:17
have used to plot and write and publish
0:19
over 25 novels so far so let's get into
0:23
it so today's video is going to be more
0:29
of just an overview of what we're going
0:31
to be talking about in this plotting
0:33
series and how it's going to come about
0:35
but I also wanted to talk to you just
0:37
for a minute about why I plot and why I
0:40
find it useful when I first got started
0:42
as a writer I really had no idea what I
0:46
was doing I think that most of us have
0:48
some innate idea of storytelling because
0:51
we've watched movies we've read books
0:54
most of our lives we've been immersed in
0:56
storytelling in all kinds of ways from
0:59
people marketing to us to parents
1:01
telling stories to us to you know
1:03
everything that we consume in terms of
1:05
books and movies and TV shows and stuff
1:07
like that so you kind of already have
1:09
this innate sense of how a story absent
1:12
flows but when it comes time for you to
1:16
actually create that story out of
1:17
nothing more than your brain it can get
1:20
a little bit more confusing because
1:21
instead of having someone else make the
1:23
decisions for you you're the one making
1:25
all of those decisions now I know that
1:27
there are a lot of people who are able
1:29
to just get a spark of an idea and they
1:32
just start writing and wherever the
1:34
story takes them they just follow that
1:37
story and in the publishing or in the
1:39
writing world people call those people
1:40
Panzers that's because they fly by the
1:43
seat of their pants they just go where
1:45
the story takes them and for a lot of
1:46
people this method works
1:47
so if pantsing works for you and that's
1:50
what you like to do and you feel like
1:52
you're coming up with a cohesive story
1:53
at the end that you just really love and
1:55
it's following kind of the basics of
1:57
story structure then don't mess with
1:59
your process everybody has a different
2:01
process so don't feel that you need to
2:04
plot or that you have to plot just
2:06
because other people are doing it you
2:08
always as a writer need to be doing
2:10
whether it comes to your publishing or
2:12
your writing or
2:13
anything in your life you should be
2:14
doing what works for you and what speaks
2:16
to you if you've watched this channel
2:18
for any amount of time you know that
2:19
planning and organizing things speaks to
2:22
me so I really need that structure if I
2:27
don't have some basic idea of where my
2:30
story starts where they are tangled up
2:33
in the middle and then how it ends
2:35
usually for me some kind of twist or
2:37
special little epilogue where there's
2:39
another little boom twist or something
2:41
you didn't see coming at the end if I
2:43
don't know where those characters end up
2:45
or a little bit about their journey I
2:47
can't start writing even if I have a
2:50
spark of an idea it's very difficult for
2:53
me to get out of my head and start just
2:56
free-flowing I end up actually wasting a
2:59
lot of time writing scenes that I end up
3:02
throwing out and I think that a lot of
3:04
Panthers actually end up throwing out a
3:05
lot of stuff but they explore their
3:07
drafts if you are pants or if you please
3:09
feel free to comment down below and kind
3:11
of talk about your process but for me
3:13
what I have found helps me be the most
3:16
efficient when I'm writing is to outline
3:18
my story ahead of time and that includes
3:21
knowing a lot about my characters and
3:23
what they're going to be going through
3:24
their basic character arc and their
3:26
character inner journey and then I need
3:29
to know the basic structure kind of like
3:31
I need to have a blueprint the house
3:34
doesn't have to be built yet it doesn't
3:35
have to be set in stone it I just need
3:38
to have that sort of blueprint or that
3:40
map to how I'm gonna make my way through
3:42
the story no with that being said the
3:44
resources and tools and tricks that I am
3:46
going to share with you in this series
3:48
most of them are not things that I have
3:50
made up things like the three-act
3:52
structure have been around in
3:53
storytelling since the very beginning of
3:55
storytelling this is like thousands of
3:57
years old that stories have been told in
3:59
this manner so I'm not taking credit for
4:02
any of this stuff what I'm doing is I'm
4:04
bringing together all the resources that
4:05
have worked best for me and giving you a
4:07
little bit of a taste of each one of
4:09
them in the back of a resource that I'm
4:12
going to have for you to download there
4:14
is going to be a resource list of my
4:17
favorite plotting books and the things
4:18
that I'm going to talk about throughout
4:19
this series I highly recommend
4:22
that you go and pick these up wherever
4:24
you can find them a lot of them are
4:26
going to be available in your library
4:28
some of them may only be available on
4:29
Amazon but most of them should be
4:32
available pretty much everywhere you can
4:34
get ebooks so please go and check out
4:37
these books really dig deeper and dive
4:39
deeper into what I'm talking about when
4:42
I'm talking about the three-act
4:43
structure and the doorway of no return
4:45
and the mirror moment and these sort of
4:46
things will make a lot more sense to you
4:48
if you go and actually read the books
4:51
that I read to get these resources if
4:53
that makes sense
4:54
so most of this is going to be just
4:56
gathering of information and resources
4:59
that I have pulled from in order to get
5:01
better at my own plotting process a lot
5:03
of this stuff as I was reading more and
5:06
more about how to plot over the years I
5:08
realized I was doing intuitively anyway
5:10
but knowing how to do it and knowing the
5:13
tools and the actual structure of the
5:16
story has freed me to really come up
5:19
with even tighter
5:20
I'm storytelling even tighter weaving of
5:23
that inner journey with the outer
5:26
journey and it's really made my stories
5:28
a lot stronger along the way and it's
5:30
helped me to write multiple POV books so
5:34
when I first started out writing I was
5:36
only writing one single POV for the
5:38
first six books in my shadow demon saga
5:40
which back then was called the people
5:42
had demons series and what I started to
5:44
realize at the end of book six was that
5:47
keeping everything in Harper's point of
5:49
view was starting to limit me because I
5:51
could only see and know what Harper
5:53
could see and know and I need it the
5:55
world was expanding so much I needed to
5:56
tell more so when I started book seven
5:59
of my series I decided to branch out to
6:01
four different points of view and in
6:03
order to really tightly structure four
6:05
points of view in a single story you
6:08
have to understand story structure and
6:11
even if your pantsing it I think it
6:13
actually might be much more difficult to
6:15
pants a multi POV story you know when
6:18
I'm talking about more than two points
6:20
of view I don't know feel free to
6:22
comment down below if you're happily
6:23
pantsing four five six POVs and a story
6:27
but I think that when you look at some
6:29
of the people that have gotten really
6:31
like famous and like epic series with
6:34
multiple points of view
6:35
you're looking at like george RR martin
6:36
and robert jordan and even JK Rowling
6:40
even though hers was more like an
6:41
omniscient with tightening in on some
6:44
places she had those multiple viewpoints
6:46
in the Harry Potter series all of these
6:48
people have plotted ahead and they knew
6:51
kind of where they were going with the
6:52
story so I think that especially if
6:54
you're writing more than one or two
6:55
points of view it's important to have
6:58
some of these plotting tools as with
6:59
anything take what you can use out of
7:02
what you learn through this series and
7:04
ignore the rest what works for you works
7:07
for you and hopefully some of these
7:09
tools will help make that click for you
7:11
because I know that especially as new
7:13
writers but even 20-plus books in one of
7:16
the main things that can hold us back is
7:18
not knowing where to go next with the
7:19
story because I think it's you know it's
7:22
one of those things where you don't even
7:23
realize until you really get into it
7:25
that oh my gosh like this is 100% up to
7:29
me and what I decide to do and there's
7:31
infinite possibilities so what do I do
7:34
sometimes I still will spend weeks
7:36
thinking about what happens next in a
7:38
scene or where I want to go with
7:39
characters but I have found that the
7:41
more tools I gather on how to be a great
7:44
plotter and really good at outlining and
7:46
understanding my characters and their
7:47
journey the better and faster I get at
7:50
writing my rough drafts and making them
7:52
really cohesive tighter or stories and
7:55
it opens me up to be more emotional in
7:58
my stories because I can really meld the
8:01
outer action with that inner character
8:05
journey and make it resonate a little
8:07
bit more and I hope to even get better
8:09
with this so what I have put together is
8:11
a free download for you that will be up
8:14
on my website it is I'm calling it plot
8:17
your novel very unique and this is
8:20
basically a guide that you can download
8:22
that will have things about the
8:25
characters inner journey and it will
8:28
take us through all the way through the
8:30
plotting process and it's like a form
8:33
that you can fill out and this is the
8:34
almost the exact thing that I use for
8:36
myself I tweaked it a little bit and
8:39
have added to it and now I've printed it
8:41
out to help me plot my latest book that
8:42
I'm working on now
8:43
but I'll be taking you through this
8:45
entire workbook but just keep in mind
8:48
that some of the terms and some of the
8:51
like this one's kind of marked up but
8:54
like this box on goal motivation and
8:57
conflict is not my invention this comes
9:00
from Debra Dixon's goal motivation
9:02
conflict book which I will link for you
9:04
down below it will be linked on my blog
9:06
and it's also in the back of this as a
9:08
resource so if you I can touch briefly
9:11
on how I use it but if you really want
9:13
to dive deeper into how you really set
9:16
up that box for goal motivation in
9:17
conflict you'll need to pick up her book
9:19
because this is these are her ideas not
9:21
mine I'm just sharing with you the
9:23
things that I have learned and how I use
9:25
these tools so I just want to make that
9:27
clear alright so we'll just talk briefly
9:29
about the structure of this 8 part video
9:31
series you're on video number 1 which is
9:34
more like the overview and introduction
9:36
on Sunday I will post my writing great
9:40
characters video which will be video
9:42
number 2 and it's going to take you
9:44
through some of the resources that I've
9:45
found that helped me to really get a
9:47
good idea of what my characters are
9:49
going through what they want on an
9:51
external level but what they really need
9:53
to experience on an internal level it
9:55
helps me to work through what themes
9:57
these characters might be going through
9:59
and this will be useful for you whether
10:01
you're writing a single POV character or
10:03
multiple POV characters you'll want to
10:05
follow through this with everyone who is
10:06
a point of view character then we're
10:09
going to in number 3 which will come out
10:11
a week from today you will get an
10:14
overview of act 1 I work as most
10:18
storytellers do off of the three act
10:20
structure which means and you've got an
10:22
act one where you're introduced to the
10:24
characters you're introduced to the
10:25
situation and the world as it appears
10:27
now you're introduced to the stakes like
10:30
if things go wrong what's at stake here
10:32
is death at stake is the whole fate of
10:35
the world at stake or is somebody's job
10:37
at stake if someone doesn't fall in love
10:39
with the right person is their happiness
10:40
at stake but you learn what's at stake
10:43
very early in the story you've got the
10:44
hook and you're introduced to the story
10:46
and the characters and the major
10:48
conflict of the story and then at the
10:50
end of Act one there's always some kind
10:52
of key event that many authors or
10:57
people that talk about plotting will
10:59
call the doorway of no return and your
11:01
character will make a decision that will
11:03
force them into a certain type of action
11:06
and of course I'm going to go into this
11:07
in much greater detail in my act 1 video
11:11
then they are taken into act 2 and Act 2
11:14
is the meet of your book this is the
11:17
longest act of the book and it makes up
11:19
the majority of what people would say is
11:22
the promise of the premise this is what
11:24
your book is actually about so after 1
11:25
is the setup and the introduction of the
11:28
characters of the stakes the conflict
11:30
and then act 2 is where your character
11:32
is tested it's where they're taken
11:35
through a journey of learning about
11:37
their new environment some people will
11:39
call this you know beginning of act 2
11:41
into moving into the new world life as
11:43
they know it is over and now they're
11:45
moving into a new world where they're
11:47
being tested they're learning new things
11:48
they're meeting new people they're
11:51
facing these certain conflicts so the
11:53
way that I have learned it is really to
11:55
break act two into two pieces so act two
11:58
part one will be another video that's
12:00
video four and video 5 will be act 2
12:03
part two because it's they're so big
12:06
they deserve kind of a piece of their
12:08
own and right there at the end of Act
12:09
two part one is something that people
12:12
called the midpoint or it can also be
12:14
called the second plot point and I've
12:15
also heard it called the mirror moment
12:18
by James Scott Bell which I'll be
12:19
talking about some of his books coming
12:20
up as well this is a moment where
12:23
everything in your story changes it
12:25
flips on its head some new revelation a
12:28
terrible defeat and we'll go more into
12:30
that but there's there's always this big
12:32
event that happens right there in the
12:33
middle of the story in the middle of act
12:35
2 that is going to set up the rest of
12:38
the story then act 2 part 2 we will move
12:42
into basically your character reaction
12:44
to that midpoint and then everything
12:47
that's going to set them up to make that
12:49
final battle or final climax of the book
12:51
inevitable so that second part of act 2
12:55
is like everything getting ready your
12:57
character needs to know the skills they
12:58
need to discover the clues they need to
13:00
you know like a lot of times in a
13:02
romance that midpoint moment will be the
13:04
first time they've your characters have
13:06
had sex or the first time that they've
13:08
kissed or gone out on a real date
13:10
first time they've realized that they're
13:11
actually in love with each other and
13:12
then the second part of act 2 is where
13:15
things start to go wrong the girlfriend
13:17
appears or the ex-girlfriend appears
13:19
some kind of conflict that was
13:21
introduced in the beginning of the story
13:22
starts to get more important over here a
13:24
lie that was told or some kind of
13:26
misunderstanding
13:27
so you'll see you'll start to see that
13:29
when I go through the part of act 2 part
13:32
2 but everything there kind of leads
13:34
straight to what happens at the end of
13:36
act 2 part 2 which is another doorway
13:39
another choice another decision or
13:42
another revelation or realization that
13:44
leads us into what we call the black
13:46
moment or the long dark night of the
13:48
soul where everything feels like it's
13:51
lost in an action this could be when
13:53
your character is captured and there
13:56
seems to be no way out in a romance this
13:58
is where your characters break up and it
14:00
seems like there's just no way they're
14:01
gonna be together but it seems like
14:03
everything is lost and the story is
14:06
never going to come together the
14:07
characters are never going to get what
14:09
they want or what they need and then
14:11
there's the final climax that final
14:13
battle for what they believe in for who
14:16
they are everything that's at stake now
14:18
we're going to fight for it and so
14:20
you've got that climax and final battle
14:21
and then you have the resolution
14:23
hopefully usually happily ever after or
14:26
at least some sort of happy for now that
14:28
leads you into the next book if you're
14:29
writing a series and we're going to talk
14:31
about that whether you're writing a
14:32
series or whether you're writing
14:33
stand-alones and stuff like that
14:35
throughout this plotting series but you
14:37
kind of get that overview of you've got
14:38
you've got the introduction and we're
14:41
introduced to the stakes then you've got
14:42
this boom this inciting or key event
14:45
that changes things for your character
14:48
and now they're in the new world and
14:50
their reaction to that is the beginning
14:51
of act 2 part 1 and they're learning new
14:55
things they're meeting new people
14:56
they're introduced to this new set of
14:58
circumstances in their world and then
15:00
boom at the end of act 2 part 1 they've
15:04
got this midpoint that suddenly things
15:06
are not what they seem and so you've got
15:08
another like climax and then act 2 part
15:12
2 they're reacting to that climax they
15:16
are gathering the tools they need they
15:18
are learning new things they're fighting
15:20
even more intense battles or getting
15:22
closer
15:23
that final battle then at the end of act
15:25
2 part 2 something else happens that
15:28
Spurs them into or makes it inevitable
15:30
this complete loss and final battle that
15:34
they have to go through in act 3 so
15:36
that's the basic story structure of
15:38
pretty much all stories that have ever
15:40
been written
15:41
now literary fiction I will not be
15:43
speaking to because I don't know as much
15:45
about like literary fiction and what the
15:48
story structure is for those books
15:51
because I know it can be a lot different
15:53
than following genre fiction but most of
15:56
us are writing genre fiction and that's
15:58
what my expertise is I write a lot of
16:01
action type stories fantasy with
16:04
villains where the world is at stake
16:06
type things and young adult horror type
16:09
stories and then I also have romances
16:11
where it's a little bit more personal
16:13
and more character-driven and I've
16:15
written both types of stories so I'm
16:16
going to speak a little bit on those
16:18
then in video 7 so we'll have gone
16:22
through let's see the overview is one
16:24
characters is the second one act 3 act 2
16:28
part 1 act 2 part 2 is video number 5
16:31
video 6 will be act 3 video 7 will be
16:34
bringing it all together and that's
16:36
where we'll discuss kind of some of the
16:37
differences you might have based on
16:40
whether you're writing a series where
16:41
there's going to be a next book in the
16:43
series or whether you're writing book 9
16:45
or 10 in a series like I am versus if
16:47
you're writing a romance or a standalone
16:49
or mystery so we'll talk about how
16:51
Chandra impacts that and we'll talk
16:53
about how to bring together all those
16:55
things that you did in the character arc
16:57
with everything that you've now done in
16:59
your plotting and your outlining and
17:01
then video 8 is going to be a video on
17:03
what happens if you get stuck because I
17:06
know for me often I actually will have
17:09
the whole thing plotted and then I'll
17:10
get like to the end of act 1 and things
17:13
aren't where I thought they were going
17:14
to be in the plot or the characters just
17:16
aren't cooperating and they aren't doing
17:18
what I want them to do so I have to make
17:21
some changes so it's like what happens
17:22
if you get stuck how do you change it
17:24
how do you have to stick to your outline
17:25
will address all those different things
17:27
so I am very excited about running this
17:30
plot series for you I hope that you will
17:32
get something out of it again I
17:34
certainly don't know
17:35
I am constantly reading new books on
17:38
plotting going to workshops and
17:40
listening to what other people have to
17:42
say about plotting because there's still
17:43
so much to learn even after writing 25
17:46
plus novels I feel like I still have so
17:50
I'm still just a newbie at this and I
17:52
still have so far to go to get my
17:55
stories even better and even more
17:56
tightly plotted you have any great
17:58
resources that I have not mentioned or
18:00
that I don't mention in this then please

19:19
that it will help you in your plotting
19:22
journey because I know that for me in
19:24
the beginning it seemed really
19:25
overwhelming like how do I make up an
19:28
entire 90 thousand word story out of
19:30
nothing but my imagination but it can be
19:33
such a fun journey for you to go through
19:35
as a writer and I'll be showing you all
19:38
the tools and tricks that I have learned
19:39
over the years and hopefully you'll be
19:41
sharing yours with me then I also will
19:43

20:12
bye
hey guys and welcome back to heart
0:01
breathing's so over the next few days or
0:04
week I'm going to be sharing with you
0:06
top eight things that I have learned
0:08
over eight years of indie publishing so
0:10
some of my top advice and lessons that I
0:13
have learned sometimes the hard way and
0:15
today's tip number two which is don't
0:19
take anything for granted so this is
The Hard Way
0:25
definitely one of those lessons that
0:27
many of us Indies have learned the hard
0:29
way so in a lot of careers what happens
0:32
is you you know you build up to a
0:35
certain level and then once you've hit
0:37
that salary level or whatever you
0:39
suddenly are making that much money for
0:41
the rest of your life and that's the way
0:44
it works like when I used to be a
0:45
teacher if you go and you get your
0:46
master's degree you're going to be
0:48
guaranteed X amount of salary increase
0:51
and then if you work for ten years
0:53
you're gonna get this much salary
0:54
increase in every year you're gonna have
0:56
this amount of insurance and there's a
0:58
lot of stability in that kind of job
1:00
but indie publishing and any kind of
1:03
entrepreneurial job is not like that and
1:06
you know what happened for me
1:09
was that over the first five years of
1:12
indie publishing maybe six six years so
1:16
over the first six full years of any
1:18
publishing I made more money and sold
1:20
more books every year than I did the
1:23
year before so I made about fifty
1:25
thousand dollars my first year indie
1:26
publishing and then I made I believe
1:28
about seventy eight thousand the next
1:30
year and then 98 thousand the next year
1:32
and then started making six figures in
1:34
my fourth year and it just went up from
1:36
there but after my sixth year I made
1:40
some mistakes so I've built my career
1:43
based on you know the six book series
1:46
that I wrote one book after the other
1:48
and I've talked about this before in
1:49
some of my other videos how I sort of
1:51
landed this strategy that I didn't even
1:53
know was a strategy at the time of
1:55
publishing in a single series and being
1:57
very focused with that but once that
1:59
series was over in 2012 I wanted to try
2:03
new things so I tried a new adult
2:05
contemporary romance which was
2:07
completely shifting genres then I also
2:09
published a zombie and which is sort of
2:11
like contemporary
2:12
fantasy apocalypse mashup thing even
2:16
though the contemporary did really well
2:18
it wasn't really building so much on
2:20
what I had done before then I started
2:22
another series and then I wrote another
2:24
book and so over the course of those
2:26
next few years my income continued to
2:28
increase because I was putting out books
2:30
that were doing well at the time but I
2:33
was also scattering my focus I was
2:35
starting new series that took you no
2:38
time to write each book and it's
2:41
something I could really go into a lot
2:42
but let's just say I started so many new
2:44
series that I scattered my focus so I
2:46
made this mistake but what you will
2:48
learn and this will come into some of
2:50
the tips later on in this series is that
2:53
it takes a long time to recover from
2:55
mistakes because it can take six months
2:57
or more to write a new book so you know
3:01
some people are talented in that they
3:03
can write a book every single month but
3:04
I'm not typically one of those people
3:06
and so it takes me a long time
3:08
especially if I you know started five
3:11
different series it's gonna take me a
3:12
long time to finish out those books
3:14
before I can start something new so the
3:16
recovery time has been very difficult so
3:19
even though I hit a peak two years ago
3:22
you know I sort of took for granted that
3:25
that was not a peak that was just the
3:27
natural trajectory of an indie career
3:29
was you know you make more money the
3:31
more books you have out and I thought
3:33
that that was absolutely true but it
3:36
isn't true and I think a lot of us have
3:38
learned that the hard way so I really
3:40
really hope that if you're just getting
3:41
into this career or even if you've been
3:43
in it a while and you've been lucky
3:45
enough to see that increase in income
3:46
that you will heed this warning because
3:49
it is very practical and very real that
3:51
there is no level that you hit an indie
3:55
where it's like okay now I'm guaranteed
3:57
this there is no salary so if you make
4:00
$200,000 one year there's no guarantee
4:02
that you're gonna make even more than
4:04
that next year just because you have
4:05
more books out there are a lot of
4:07
factors that can affect your back list
4:10
that can affect how well you know some
4:13
of the vendors are promoting your back
4:14
list there are trends that change so
4:16
like for example that new adult
4:18
contemporary romance series that I wrote
4:20
has sold over a hundred thousand copies
4:22
as a series because it was a popular
4:25
genre now
4:26
those more emotional not sexy
4:29
contemporary new adults don't sell as
4:31
well as they did in say 2014 so I'm just
4:35
not seeing as many sales from that part
4:38
of my back list as I was a couple of
4:40
years ago now that may change again in
4:42
two years that hey maybe they'll be kind
4:44
of a revival for those sort of emotional
4:46
college-age stories and I'll be able to
4:49
reap remote them and cover them and do
4:50
some other things that are gonna make
Things Will Change
4:52
them sell better but for now they're not
4:55
making anywhere near as much money as
4:56
they did two years ago and that's not
4:59
really something that's in my control I
5:01
can't control the trends I can't control
5:03
what readers are currently reading or
5:05
buying and you will see that you've seen
5:07
that in trad pub for years and years and
5:09
now you're seeing that an indie
5:11
publishing as well that you know over
5:13
time trends are going to come and go
5:15
what sells really well one year might
5:17
not sell as well next year but basically
5:20
what I want you to understand is that
5:22
you cannot take anything in this
5:23
business for granted you can't look at
5:26
any one factor and say well this is the
5:28
way it is and it will stay that way
5:30
forever not your income because I've
5:33
actually like with the way that Kindle
5:35
unlimited has been affecting the
5:37
majority of authors income right now
5:39
I've actually heard more authors saying
5:42
in the last year that their income is
5:43
dropped by 50 to 70 percent and it's
5:47
terrifying because that's an
5:49
introduction of a new program that we
5:51
have no control over that has severely
5:54
affected our income there are also
5:55
different changes that Amazon makes like
5:58
with their algorithms or you know Google
6:00
Play when they took the free books off
6:03
of their genre lists my income there
6:05
went in half like overnight and these
6:07
kinds of things happen is just part of
6:10
the business and so you cannot take for
6:13
granted that because something is true
6:15
today it will still be true tomorrow the
6:17
vendors change the way they do things
6:19
readers change what they enjoy reading
6:22
strategies change in terms of how it
6:25
works like you know a lot of people are
6:27
relying on free ebooks as the loss
6:29
leader at the beginning of their series
6:30
but now that Kindle unlimited is kind of
6:33
like read all you want for free that
6:35
free book at the beginning of your
6:36
series isn't working like it was two
6:38
years ago so things are going
6:40
to change and really the only thing that
6:42
you can take for granted or say that
6:44
it's true in indie publishing is that
6:46
everything is temporary things are going
6:48
to change all the time and you can be
6:50
expecting that change there's probably a
6:53
lot I could say about this but one of
6:55
the warnings is don't take your income
6:57
level for granted it's not going to
6:59
increase just because you have more
7:01
books there are a variety of factors
7:02
that can affect it so don't think that
7:04
just because you hit six figures now
7:06
you're gonna make six figures for the
7:08
rest of your life because what I've seen
7:09
people do unfortunately is say oh my
7:12
gosh now I've arrived I've had my first
7:13
six figure year and they go out and they
7:16
buy a new car and they get a new house
7:18
and they go on vacation and they you
7:20
know buy all new clothes and new
7:22
furniture and they take out loans and
7:24
you know then the next thing you know
7:25
they're completely broke and their
7:27
income is cut in half and it's just not
7:30
a great place to be when you're trying
7:32
to make a living on your you know on
7:34
your creative energy because when your
7:37
income halves and now you're in all this
7:39
debt it is very difficult to be super
7:41
creative and excited about your career
7:43
so just be aware that there is no income
7:47
level that you hit that you're gonna be
7:48
there forever
7:49
it can be affected by things that you
7:52
don't have control over and it can
7:53
change overnight
Take Your Fans For Granted
7:55
don't take your fans for granted and
7:57
think that I can do anything I want to
7:58
them and they're gonna love me I mean I
8:00
can treat them like crap I cannot talk
8:02
to them for six months I can you know
8:04
discount a new release even though they
8:06
all just bought it for $4.99 and
8:08
nobody's gonna care they love me
8:10
whatever don't take your fans for
8:11
granted because if you treat them poorly
8:14
and this is going to come in another tip
8:16
later in the week if you treat your fans
8:18
poorly and you take them for granted
8:20
that they're just always gonna be there
8:21
no matter how you treat them you're
8:23
probably going to wake up a few years
8:25
from now and be like why are my books no
8:27
longer selling because you were taking
8:28
your fans for granted you were taking
8:30
that fame for granted and you know I
8:33
will talk about this in more detail so I
8:35
won't go into it too much but just don't
8:37
take your fans for granted and assume
8:40
that no matter what you do or how you
8:41
treat them they're always going to be
8:42
there because people do care about how
8:45
you treat them and whether you treat
8:46
them with respect
Dont Take Strategies Tactics For Granted
8:47
don't take strategies or tactics for
8:50
granted either I see a lot of people
8:52
popping up and face
8:54
but groups and even authors who go out
8:56
and teach courses on strategies or
8:59
tactics that are very short-term like
9:01
you know back in the day there was a
9:03
thing where you would set a book free on
9:05
Amazon and when it would come off free
9:07
back when they had like their KDP select
9:10
thing before kayuu
9:12
and you know the book would go way up
9:14
into ranking and it was like kind of a
9:16
way to trick the ranking system and a
9:19
lot of people relied on that and I think
9:21
that they began to think you know this
9:23
is my new strategy and I'm going to use
9:25
this and they we know rearrange their
9:26
entire career in their entire strategy
9:28
of writing you know based on that then
9:32
all of a sudden overnight Amazon changed
9:34
the way they do things and that strategy
9:36
no longer works well it's gonna take you
9:38
potentially years to recover
9:39
if you based your entire strategy around
9:42
that same sort of thing happened when
9:44
Kay you changed from paying per download
9:47
to now they pay authors per page read so
9:51
a lot of people started writing really
9:52
short fiction like four thousand words
9:55
and throwing up tons and tons like
9:56
hundreds of things that were really
9:58
really short because they were getting
10:00
paid every time a reader downloaded that
10:02
item so they could write a short story
10:05
in a day and put a new one up every
10:07
single day and get paid the same as
10:08
someone who had a hundred thousand word
10:10
novel and so people began to take this
10:13
very short term strategy or tactic
10:16
really and make it the basis for their
10:18
whole career thinking that this is how
10:20
things are going to be forever but the
10:23
truth is they changed I Amazon finally
The Truth About Amazon
10:26
was like you know what this really isn't
10:27
fair that somebody who wrote 4,000 words
10:29
is getting paid the same as someone who
10:31
wrote a hundred thousand words so they
10:33
changed the system to paper pages read
10:35
and when that changed overnight it
10:38
boosted some people's income way up and
10:41
other people man they fell really really
10:44
hard because when you only have 4,000
10:46
words in your little book you're getting
10:48
paid like five cents or something every
10:50
time someone downloads that instead of a
10:52
dollar so we're not talking about 50
10:54
cents we're talking about almost you
10:55
know a hundred percent of your income
10:57
like 90 you just lost 95 percent of your
10:59
income what you need to be aware of just
11:01
as a tip is that no tactic no algorithm
11:05
on em
11:06
Sahn no vendor like the way their lists
11:09
work or the way that you know even you
11:11
can't take anything for granted even the
11:13
size of the thumbnail on Amazon it could
11:16
change at any minute
11:17
the way your author page looks at Apple
11:19
books and the way they link series that
11:21
could change at any minute what Google
11:23
features on their genre lists or what
11:24
genres are being offered any of that
11:27
could change Barnes & Noble could
11:28
completely fold or they could get bought
11:30
by another company and suddenly become
11:32
like the biggest seller of books you
11:34
really can't take anything for granted
11:35
and unless you have a crystal ball that
11:37
tells you how things are going to be all
11:40
you can do is take what you've learned
11:41
and pay attention to what's happening
11:44
and guesstimate but what I would say is
11:48
the best thing that you can do is when
11:50
you do have great months
11:52
save your money when you have those
11:54
years where you're making six figures
11:56
save as much as you can don't go out and
11:58
stretch yourself to buy a bigger house
12:00
or to buy you know all these extra
12:02
things save as much as you can be
12:05
conservative expect that your income is
12:08
going to go down at some point so that
12:09
you know you've got that buffer and you
12:11
don't have to freak out and go back and
12:13
get a regular job or write something
12:15
that you don't want to write just so you
12:16
can make money in the short term also
12:19
focus on craft focus on the things that
12:21
are going to last no matter what which
12:24
is that readers are always going to want
12:25
to read really really good books they
12:27
may not always want to read vampires in
12:30
space with you know I don't even know
Reverse Harem
12:32
whatever trend is the current trend like
12:35
reverse harem readers may not always
12:37
enjoy writing or reading reverse harem
12:40
but they're always going to enjoy
12:41
reading really great books so if you
12:44
decide to go for a trend like I did when
12:46
I wrote new adult contemporary romance
12:48
that was a very trendy thing back in
12:50
2013 when I was like oh I have a great
12:52
story for this I want to write it but
12:54
that was a trend and if you write as
12:57
great a book as you can and you write to
12:59
your heart then it will transcend the
13:02
trend to some degree you're gonna see
13:05
ups and downs no matter what but if you
13:07
are writing the best book that you can
13:09
it will sell longer term than something
13:12
that you wrote as fast as you could just
13:14
to make a quick buck so that's going to
Conclusion
13:17
play into some of my tips later as well
13:19
but you
13:20
today's tip is really you can't take
13:22
anything for granted there's no one
13:24
that's gonna guarantee you a salary in
13:26
this business it's always going to be up
13:28
and down and there there are going to be
13:29
great months and there are going to be
13:31
really low months and just because you
13:33
have 20 books now instead of 10 does not
13:35
mean you're gonna be making twice as
13:37
much money it just doesn't work that way
13:39
so do what you can to build the career
13:41
based on a solid foundation instead of
13:44
things that are very short-term tactics
13:46
that might not last very long and you
13:49
know pay attention to saving money to
13:52
understanding that if you're on a high
13:54
point you know it's kind of like seasons
13:56
if you're having a good season that at
13:59
any moment you could go into a down
14:01
season so the more you can insulate
14:03
yourself from those ups and downs by
14:05
writing really great books by following
14:07
strategies that work you know more
14:09
long-term and by you know saving up as
14:13
much money as you can during the good
14:14
month so that you can pay to have your
14:16
next books edited and new covers and new
14:19
marketing and stuff like that the better
14:21
off you're going to be because the last
14:23
thing you want to do to your creativity
14:24
is bog it down with a disappointment
14:28
that you've now got all these this debt
14:30
and you can't afford your house and that
14:32
sort of thing because I have seen it
14:33
sadly happen to too many people over the
14:35
last couple of years so don't take
14:37
anything for granted guys be grateful
14:39
for every step along the way but always
14:41
be planning for things to change at some
14:44
point alright that's it for today's

[Music]
and i know we got something good
0:07
[Music]
0:28
hey everybody welcome back to heart
0:30
breathings so you guys are gonna get two
0:32
sort of writing vlog videos in a row
0:35
because i am
0:37
getting back into
0:39
the passion of writing my book and i
0:41
think so much of it has to do with
0:43
finally being settled in this beautiful
0:45
house and feeling safe and
0:47
having that sense of security is
0:49
allowing my creativity to thrive so i
0:52
have finally finished well it's not
0:55
finished but i have finally gotten my
0:57
what i'm calling my witchy writing room
0:59
settled a little bit more so that i can
1:01
actually work in here and
1:03
today i'm going to show you and share
1:05
with you my plotting wall and how i use
1:07
it my notebook and just a little bit of
1:10
an update of how i'm using that happy
1:12
planner as my plotting planner and then
1:15
i'm going to go out and write for a
1:16
little bit so i'll show you what i take
1:18
with me so let's go writing book 12. so
1:21
this is my beautiful witchy writing room
1:25
so my brighter
1:26
office what i'm calling the library that
1:28
has all those shelves is more dedicated
1:31
to my planner stuff and doing my sort of
1:34
business work but i specifically was
1:37
excited about this house because i knew
1:39
i was going to get a room where i could
1:40
kind of indulge in
1:42
some of the more spiritual and
1:45
creative sides of my personality not
1:47
that the other room isn't creative but i
1:49
needed a place that could be kind of a
1:51
little spiritual place where i could
1:53
keep my crystals and my candles my
1:56
husband has a lot of allergies so it's
1:58
nice to have a space a little bit away
2:00
from him where i can use my essential
2:02
oils and i can
2:05
light my candles and not have to worry
2:06
about bothering him plus i have this
2:09
gorgeous window that i was able to put
2:12
my desk right in front of and i
2:14
love the fact that i also have a
2:16
bathroom
2:17
in this room it's currently partially
2:19
being used as storage back here for
2:23
my tripod and some of the boxes i
2:24
haven't undone but
2:26
this room is really cute and it's got
2:29
the cutest tile and i just love it and
2:32
so the fact that this has its own
2:34
bathroom even with a shower i think will
2:36
allow me to
2:38
have a little bit of a writing retreat
2:40
location
2:42
home like inside my home where i can
2:45
really and truly just shut this door
2:47
it's kind of tucked away from the rest
2:48
of the house and enjoy my writing space
My Plotting Wall
2:51
but there will be no writing happening
2:53
for me because of the way my process
2:55
works until i really figure out
2:58
what's going on in the book so that's
3:00
where this wall comes in now i
3:02
originally had purchased a big acrylic
3:06
board just a clear acrylic board to go
3:08
on this wall and it's going to be
3:10
beautiful but it's maybe a third of the
3:12
size of this wall
3:14
or this space that i have here and i had
3:18
some reasons why it was difficult to put
3:20
up that had some paint splotches and the
3:22
whole wall was gonna have to be redone
3:23
before i could put a pretty clear
3:25
acrylic thing on there and so i finally
3:27
decided okay enough waiting for things
3:30
to be perfect i'm just gonna go and buy
3:32
some craft paper and i'm gonna put up a
3:35
wall like i used to do in my old house
3:37
so
3:38
if you have just a blank stretch of wall
3:41
this is such a great way if you are a
3:43
visual
3:44
plotter or a visual person like you guys
3:47
if you follow me you've seen my kanban
3:49
board i love to have things
3:51
out on the wall but it's not always the
3:53
most attractive thing if it's like in
3:55
the middle of your living room in our
3:56
previous house i had to put it literally
3:58
behind the front door because that was
3:59
the only space but here i kind of get to
4:02
indulge so this wall i don't know if
4:04
it'll show up on camera is a textured
4:06
wall so i did a double
4:09
layer of this white craft paper and i
4:11
put it up with just some black masking
4:14
tape because the masking tape doesn't
4:16
pull the paint off the wall so you
4:18
wouldn't want to use like duct tape or
4:20
anything like that but masking tape
4:21
works painters tape will work and it's
4:25
really great so this is two long sheets
4:29
separated into four spaces so you've got
4:31
one big sheet here and one big sheet
4:33
here with a line down the middle and
4:35
then i separated each one into
4:38
two more spaces and the way that i mark
4:41
things off is act one goes here so the
4:45
first doorway of the plot will go down
4:47
here at the bottom and i will just plot
4:50
this way down
4:51
the paper
4:53
then i have act two part one which is
4:55
basically the first half of act two and
4:59
that act ends with the midpoint down
5:01
here then you've got act two part two
5:04
which of course is what leads you into
5:08
the climax of the novel which is act
5:10
three and for me a lot of times act
5:12
three is not quite as
5:14
long or have as many different scenes in
5:16
it as the rest of the novel but i have a
5:19
feeling with this book because it is the
5:20
climax of the entire series that i might
5:22
even end up needing to expand act 3 just
5:25
a little bit in terms of all the action
5:27
and things that are happening so this is
5:30
the main section of the wall and all i
5:33
did was buy
5:35
a large
5:36
roll of white craft paper from amazon
5:40
you can also get this at home depot or i
5:42
mean you can get it at office depot or
5:45
staples or something like that probably
5:47
walmart it can use like easel paper from
5:50
a kids like easel craft paper anything
5:53
like that you could use brown if you
5:55
didn't have white any color will work if
5:57
you have a teacher in your life they may
5:59
have bulletin board paper that you could
6:01
use i also have a little bucket over
6:04
here of supplies so i have
6:08
post-it notes some of them
6:10
are lined and some of them are just
6:12
plain these are the 3x3 and i think this
6:15
is something like 4x4
6:17
then i also have
6:19
some markers so these are the bic market
6:21
chisel tip permanent markers and these
6:24
are meant to write specifically on like
6:27
flip chart markers so you could or flip
6:29
charts like teachers do on the wall or
6:31
like in business presentations those
6:33
types of flip charts
6:34
and so these will not
6:36
bleed through to your wall you can also
6:39
get flip chart markers or crayola super
6:41
tips those are pretty cheap but you can
6:43
get them in lots of colors those will
6:45
not bleed through and i might actually
6:46
end up going to get my super tips from
6:49
upstairs because i might use them
6:52
on this wall but basically i have a
6:55
different color of post-it note and a
6:56
different color of marker for each point
6:59
of view in my novel now this particular
7:02
novel has four main points of view and
7:04
then the pink and black are for two sort
7:07
of subsidiary points of view they'll
7:08
only get a few scenes and what i like to
7:11
do
7:12
is i will use those post-it notes to
7:14
indicate a scene and i'll write
7:17
something on here instead of writing
7:19
directly on the white paper and the
7:21
reason that i like to do that is because
7:23
scenes tend to change so when i'm
7:26
initially plotting if i'm able to put
7:28
them on with a post-it note then i can
7:31
back away and really start thinking
7:32
about the flow of story okay this
7:34
happens here especially with a multiple
7:36
pov story
7:38
pacing is really important so you don't
7:39
want to have necessarily two scenes back
7:42
to back that feel the same but are from
7:43
different character povs you want to
7:46
keep the pacing interesting the conflict
7:49
you know constantly ramping up maybe you
7:51
would realize oh you know what this
7:52
character's got to have this major
7:54
realization in their character arc
7:55
before this act one climax so then you
7:58
might take an entire section here and
8:00
move it over to act one and that happens
8:03
to me quite frequently so what i've
8:04
learned to do is instead of writing
8:06
things down directly on the paper
8:08
i start out writing them on sticky notes
8:10
because i can easily move those around
8:13
it's very visual because you've got the
8:15
color code going on here and again i do
8:18
actually have a second section that i
8:20
put up here and i used the purple
8:22
masking tape and i wrote the word
8:24
characters up here now i'm not at a
8:27
stage because this is book 12 in my
8:29
series i've been writing this for over a
8:30
decade
8:31
where i need to write down like hair
8:32
color eye color stuff like that but you
8:34
could do that if you were just starting
8:36
especially if you were writing a magical
8:38
world where you needed to remember what
8:39
powers these people have or anything
8:41
like that but i will be using this for
8:43
character arc because for me
8:46
coming all the way around to the end of
8:48
the series like harper is purple i need
8:50
to think about where her character was
8:52
in book one and really bring that home
8:56
in book 12 like
8:57
really closing up that character arc
9:00
thematically and this is something i had
9:02
the extreme pleasure of talking to holly
9:04
black about when we met for dinner last
9:06
week so that's been on my mind a lot so
9:09
this will be a place to kind of remind
9:11
myself of the thematic character arc
9:14
areas and threads that need to be closed
9:16
up as i'm working on the plot so i think
9:19
this is super cool and i'm very excited
9:21
to use it
9:22
another thing that i like to do with
9:24
this paper is
9:26
i like to put images up on this wall
9:28
which probably surprises no one i've
9:30
already been telling you how much of a
9:32
visual learner i am
9:34
so let's say there was an opening scene
9:37
was a scene with a bridge in it it's not
9:38
but let's just say it was and i had a
9:41
photo here of the brooklyn bridge and
9:43
that was the bridge that i had in my
9:45
head and it's a visual location for the
9:47
the scene that's happening here i might
9:50
take a full sheet mailing label like
9:52
from office depot or somewhere like that
9:54
that has sticky like sticker paper on
9:56
the back and then i can print it on that
9:59
sheet cut it out and slap it up here on
10:02
this wall and because i like to use
10:05
removable sticker sheets
10:07
if i decide you know what that bridge
10:08
scene actually needs to be the end of
10:10
act one i can actually pull it off and
10:14
stick it down at the bottom there so for
10:16
me that allows me to visually see the
10:19
locations that the characters are in
10:21
when i'm plotting that scene and so it
10:23
becomes
10:25
this great sort of tapestry
10:27
of story where i can see where my
10:30
characters are at any given time how
10:32
they're interacting with each other
10:34
whether or not i have a good pacing
10:36
going on do i have too many scenes of
10:38
harper in a row and i haven't had
10:39
anything with jackson in it in a while
10:41
now when i'm plotting multiple pov i
10:44
don't try to have like alternating
10:46
chapters it doesn't have to be like
10:48
like this sort of grid where it's one
10:50
character after the other before i cycle
10:52
back up and i don't think that usually
10:54
creates the best fiction anyway it can
10:56
work but it just depends on your story
10:58
but for me
10:59
i might have three harper scenes in a
11:01
row so three purples and then one
11:03
jackson one leah and then back to harper
11:05
for three scenes and that's okay if
11:07
that's the way the story best flows but
11:09
i just like to see it visually so i can
11:11
see where everybody is and who i haven't
11:13
touched in on for a while because like i
11:16
said it might turn out that i get all
11:17
the way over here to act two and realize
11:19
i've only had one aired in chapter
11:22
and i've got to pull him in earlier
11:25
because not only will the readers be
11:26
wondering but i can't just drop him into
11:29
the climax without letting the reader
11:30
know what he's been up to and what his
11:33
character arc has been especially in
11:34
this final book so that is my plotting
11:37
wall and how i'm going to use it sadly
11:40
i'm not really going to be able to show
11:42
you guys how this progresses and i'm
11:44
always sad that this is the way it is
11:46
because it will have spoilers and i have
11:48
thousands of people thankfully
11:50
very gratefully waiting for this book so
11:53
there's no way i can put that online
11:54
once it actually gets moving but i might
11:56
be able to stand far back from it and
11:58
kind of blur some things out so you can
12:00
see the general shape that it takes and
12:02
then maybe someday when we have a little
12:04
bit of distance from the release i'll be
12:05
able to share exactly what it looks like
12:07
but whenever we get to a first book in a
12:10
series maybe a couple books down the
12:12
road i'll be able to share with you guys
12:14
a little bit more what this looks like
12:15
but i hope you enjoy that look at my
12:18
plotting wall okay so this is my number
12:20
one favorite backpack
12:22
it is from jujube which means it's
My Backpack
12:25
technically a diaper bag but i don't
12:27
care i got this used and i absolutely
12:30
love this bag it's a hello kitty
12:32
tokidoki jujubee bag
12:34
and it has some nice
12:36
space in the front for like my
12:37
headphones and things like that
12:40
it has a pocket here and then a pocket
12:42
back here as well and then a larger
12:44
pocket for your laptop or anything that
12:47
might go here so i am going to head to
12:50
my local coffee shop same one you guys
12:52
saw me in my last vlog and i'm going to
12:55
continue to work on the plot so
12:57
if you are watching this and the video
12:59
has just gone up tomorrow friday i think
13:02
it's may 19th or something we have a
13:05
virtual writing retreat going on in the
13:07
heart breathing's writing community so
13:08
those live streams will happen here on
13:10
youtube or on our facebook group and
13:13
there's lots of people that go live i'll
13:15
be live every morning from 9 to 11
13:17
central time so go to the link i'll put
13:20
it down below and either join us in the
13:22
facebook group or here on youtube and
13:24
we've got lots of different channels
13:25
that'll be live streaming so my goal is
13:28
to get far enough in
13:30
my plotting
13:32
that i can actually be writing this
13:34
weekend if you followed me during
13:37
nanowrimo you know that i did start
13:39
writing this book i wrote actually 40
13:41
000 words of it and if you'd like to see
13:43
a video
13:44
talking about how i knew that i just
13:46
needed to throw it out and start over
13:48
i'll be happy to talk about that
13:50
excruciating process but
13:52
we'll just say that it's basically like
13:54
i'm starting the book over it wasn't
13:56
good enough it wasn't going in a good
13:57
direction and i may be able to salvage a
14:00
few scenes but for the most part i'm
14:01
just starting over so let me talk about
14:03
what i'm taking as i try to get ready to
14:06
finish up the plotting and my index
14:09
cards and things so
My Plotting Happy Planner
14:11
this is a synergy with this wall so i
14:14
have a similar wall
14:16
like a grid in my small notebook and i
14:19
will use them both and anything i go out
14:22
to the coffee shop and add to here will
14:24
then get added onto a post-it note and
14:26
put up on that wall later but this is a
14:29
classic size happy planner with a cover
14:32
on it
14:33
and just lots of stickers so some of
14:35
these like this kind of witchy writer
14:37
one
14:38
and
14:39
warning cliffhanger head are from winkle
14:42
lark on redbubble i will link her shop
14:44
down below i think this one is also from
14:46
her shop i cannot remember where this
14:47
one is from i think it's from anthem
14:50
sticker company potentially and then
14:52
this is from studio adorkable but i can
14:55
link all those little sticker shops
14:56
below in the front of this i have a
14:59
procrasti planner etc typewriter sticker
15:01
here and then the functional things that
15:03
i have is i have a little card of washi
15:06
tape with each of my pov colors on it
15:08
because i will use that throughout my
15:10
plotting i also have a little sticker
15:13
sheet for each color just these little
15:16
sticker dots for each color of my pov
15:19
along with a little bit of a guide there
15:22
as to which colors i'm using so i can
15:24
remember which shades of green and so on
15:26
i have some stickers that are just star
15:28
stickers and some decorative stickers
15:31
i also have this little pouch that clips
15:34
into my happy planner and inside here i
15:38
have crayola super tips for each of the
15:40
main points of view i tend to use these
15:43
at the top and bottoms of each page so
15:45
that i can at a glance see
15:48
whose pov i'm working in i also have a
15:51
multi-pin so
15:53
this one is a uni style fit multi-pin
15:55
and it has five pins inside of it so i
15:58
have black and then i have these four
16:01
colors green red purple and blue inside
16:04
this one pen so that if i'm not wanting
16:07
to dig into my bigger bag i just have
16:09
this one pen and i can switch out the
16:10
colors for the points of view and then i
16:13
have some white out tape
16:16
and i have these smaller two by two
16:19
sticky notes of each of my pov colors
16:21
and so really
16:23
i could just grab this one notebook and
16:26
my index cards
16:27
and not have to grab the rest of my
16:30
backpack i have some other sheets here
16:32
that of course are also free for you to
16:34
download so this is my writing plan
16:35
where i'm kind of putting myself on a
16:38
schedule for when i want the book to be
16:39
done
16:40
then i have a writing tracker where i
16:43
can track each phase of the book so i'm
16:46
working on the plot right now next will
16:48
be the draft the revisions the edits and
16:51
so on and i can talk about here like
16:53
which phase i'm in how much progress i
16:55
made for the day and any notes that i
16:57
have so that i can track the progress
16:59
now you don't have to do that obviously
17:01
not everyone does it it's not great for
17:04
everybody to have to track things some
17:05
people don't like it but i like to have
17:08
data so that when i go to write my next
17:10
book i can see how long did the plotting
17:12
process actually take me i thought it
17:14
was going to take this many days but it
17:15
actually took me three times longer and
17:17
then i can use that data to guesstimate
17:19
how long it's going to take me to plot
17:20
the next book and then i also have a
17:22
word count tracker here where you can
17:24
write the date
17:26
how much you wrote in this sprint how
17:28
much you wrote total for the day and how
17:29
much your total is for the entire
17:31
manuscript and i have these numbered out
17:35
because i'm guesstimating this book will
17:36
be between 120 and 140 000 words so i
17:40
need between because my average sprint
17:42
is about 650 words i need between about
17:44
185 to 215 sprints so i have printed
17:48
that sheet out enough times to get to
17:51
215 sprints and i'm hoping that as long
17:54
as i track every single sprint that i
17:56
have
17:57
then
17:58
by the time i get to this sheet the book
18:01
should be done
18:02
and that gives me a little bit of extra
18:04
motivation i do have some extra page
18:06
here just in case i need it i also have
18:09
a list here of the previous books in the
18:11
series and i've been taking notes on
18:13
what's happened in those books like
18:14
story threads that need to come through
18:16
and then i just have a bunch of blank
18:18
paper then beyond that
18:20
i have
18:22
actual weekly sheets from a happy
18:24
planner so you can see it starts in may
18:26
and since i'm going out to plot today
18:29
this is the 17th of may i will write on
18:32
here how many words i got or what
18:34
progress i made so i'll probably write
18:36
something similar to that phase sheet
18:38
and i'll write plot
18:39
10 index cards or finished act 1 but
18:42
then once i get into the writing let's
18:44
say i'm doing that on friday i will
18:46
write here whose pov i was working on
18:48
and how many words i got written now
18:50
this is a bit redundant because i'm also
18:52
going to be writing it in that phase
18:54
sheet
18:55
but i like to be able to you guys know
18:57
i'm visual i like to be able to see it
18:59
at a glance too and be able to fill this
19:01
and gives me a lot of satisfaction which
19:03
then builds positive momentum for me to
19:05
keep working keep moving forward and
19:07
then if i see that i've had five or six
19:09
days where i haven't worked on the story
19:10
i know it's time to get back into it so
19:12
for me it can provide some motivation
19:15
and then i don't have the weekly pages
19:17
in here it's just the monthly pages
19:20
because i want to just track that month
19:22
overview and that is what is in here i
19:24
do have another book in here as well you
19:28
can kind of see the edge of it because
19:30
whenever that's my next book on deck
19:32
that i'll be writing so if i happen to
19:34
have an idea for that while i'm out or
19:36
while i'm working in my plotting
19:37
notebook i can still see it
19:40
so those are my favorite tools that's
19:42
how i'm getting back into it now
19:44
obviously for some people all this extra
19:46
stuff with stationery doesn't make any
19:48
sense because you just fly by the seat
19:50
of your pants you just sit down and
19:52
write and maybe all you need is a
19:53
notebook and scratch scratches of paper
19:55
and you know what your book is going to
19:56
be potentially even better than mine
19:59
there's no
20:00
like correlation between the more you
20:02
plot the better your book is that
20:04
doesn't necessarily like correlate it's
20:07
just what tools work for you to get the
20:09
dang book done and what tools don't work
20:11
so if you're watching this and you're
20:12
like oh my gosh why is she doing all
20:14
this work just know that maybe you don't
20:16
need to do this but there might be
20:18
somebody out there that's watching
20:19
that's really been struggling to
20:22
get motivated to write and
20:24
really formulate the thoughts in our
20:26
brains because some people some of us
20:28
are just like me included are just not
20:30
built or wired to where i can just sit
20:32
down and think through it all in my head
20:34
and i certainly can't just sit down and
20:36
write it i need to see step by step i
20:39
need to visualize it like a movie in my
20:41
head and the more i can do that in
20:43
visual ways like index cards
20:46
sticky notes
20:47
as long as i have all the tools
20:48
available i may not use every single
20:51
thing in the plotting of this book but i
20:53
have those tools available if i need
20:54
them and that helps me not only get
20:56
motivated but it helps me keep my
20:58
thoughts in order and it helps me to
21:00
visually see the plot process so let me
21:02
know in the comments if you're somebody
21:04
who really resonates with this and you
21:06
think you're going to try it or if
21:07
you're somebody who doesn't need any of
21:09
this stuff and you like to just sit down
21:11
and write in a notebook or you just like
21:13
to do everything in scrivener let me
21:15
know i'd love to see your process
21:16
because we're all different and
21:18
everyone's process is valuable even if
21:20
it looks completely different from mine
21:22
a couple other things that are always
21:23
with me some kind of little figurines
21:25
that i like to sit on the desk when i'm
21:27
working just brings me joy and
21:30
headphones so i can listen to music and
21:31
drown out the sounds of the cafe those
21:33
are always with me usually have some
21:36
washi tapes and things like that and now
21:38
i'm ready to go
Writing At A Cafe
21:46
i've been waiting all my life for
21:47
something
21:50
i've been down the darkest roads and up
21:52
in the clouds
21:54
but i've always felt that something's
21:56
missing
21:57
[Music]
22:15
now all i have to do is
22:18
[Music]
22:37
we got something good
22:48
[Music]
22:58
[Music]
23:06
i feel so much
23:07
[Music]
23:17
it made me feel like i could touch the
23:20
sky
23:24
[Music]
23:34
okay guys that is it for the
Wrap Up
23:37
vlog and for taking a look at my new
23:40
outlining and plotting wall and my
23:42
notebook and
23:43
really just getting my motivation and
23:46
excitement back for that book and
23:48
you know i've really been working on
23:50
this book since last july in one way or
23:53
another and i'm basically starting it
23:55
all over and i share those struggles
23:58
with you because i know there are so
23:59
many of you out there who also feel like
24:02
you've started and stopped and tried and
24:05
you're just not getting anywhere
24:07
and sometimes being a writer is like
24:09
that that we do our best we try we can't
24:12
quite get it together as long as you
24:14
don't give up you are going to make it i
24:17
believe in you i know you can do this
24:19
join me in re-energizing our motivation
24:22
and getting back on track whether it
24:24
looks like putting a board up on your
24:26
wall or setting up a new notebook or
24:29
just diving in in a new document in
24:31
scrivener don't give up on your dreams
24:33
you've got this
24:35
as far as upcoming content i did place a
24:38
poll on my community tab last week about
24:41
what videos you guys want to see and it
24:43
seems like a lot of you are interested
24:45
in a video series on how to write scenes
24:48
that keep your readers engaged so look
24:50

26:12
you
Planning For Writers
hey everybody I'm so excited to finally
0:04
set up my B6 plotting notebook so I have
0:08
been doing everything I can to try to
0:11
get back into the excitement and the joy
0:14
and the love of writing and if you've
0:17
been around for a bit you know that I've
0:19
been struggling a little bit with
0:21
writing consistently and it's been a
0:24
problem really for a couple of years
0:26
almost and so this is my attempt at I'm
0:30
hoping it's going to be a really
0:32
successful attempt at getting back to
0:34
Joy finding that spark again and I'm
0:36
calling this writer reset and part of my
0:40
writer reset is just getting my plotting
0:44
notebook and everything sorted so I used
0:46
to use a happy planner for this and what
0:49
I'm gonna do just part of sort of
0:51
reigniting a spark for me sometimes is
0:53
trying something different like a new
0:55
location or a new plotting process or
0:59
some you know just something different
1:00
change of surroundings change of tools
1:03
that I'm using
1:05
so I bought a basic astrology notebook
1:09
that I have been loving using that size
1:11
and I also found a B6 traveler's
1:14
notebook a leather one that was
1:15
pre-loved from eBay and so I'm gonna set
1:19
it up today so what I've been doing is I
1:22
have these just sort of B6 notebook
1:25
covers that I got used from uh eBay also
1:28
like a couple of years ago when I bought
1:30
this foxy fix that might have been last
1:32
year I'm not sure and these are just
1:35
plastic notebook covers that you can put
1:38
paper into and make them a little bit
1:40
prettier to go inside your traveler's
1:42
notebook so I have these lovely papers I
1:45
think most of them are from honeybee
1:47
shop but I'm taking out the floral pages
1:49
that were in there and switching to a
1:52
more purple magical theme that matches
1:55
my brand a little bit more
1:57
so the first thing I'm doing is just
1:59
cutting those down to size using the
2:02
previous Pages as a template
2:05
and then putting them into those little
2:07
folders I am going to be using a couple
2:11
of different smaller notebooks along
2:13
with my B6 stalagy notebook and so I'll
2:18
share with you kind of what I'm using
2:19
those for I don't even know honestly if
2:21
I'll end up using them as much as I
2:23
think but we'll see so here I'm just
2:26
taking a piece of
2:29
sticker paper or actually it's like a
2:31
full page shipping label and I'm going
2:34
to make a Washi dashboard these take a
2:36
little bit of time and they can be kind
2:38
of fiddly but they're always so
2:40
beautiful in the front of thestology
2:42
this is something I've seen many other
2:44
people do on Instagram and YouTube but I
2:47
first learned how to do this from
2:48
dakshina so I will link some of her
2:51
videos where she kind of taught me how
2:52
to do this but it turned out so pretty
2:55
so once you pull it up and you pull the
2:57
backing off you can just put it right
2:59
there in the front of your planner and
3:02
it just gives it a little bit more
3:03
decoration as opposed to the typical
3:06
just gray that's in the front of
3:09
thestology so
3:11
I left some blank pages in the front of
3:14
this notebook so that I can keep track
3:17
of what other stories end up going in
3:19
here but I have so you know I'm setting
3:23
it up right now for The Disappearance of
3:25
Vanessa Shaw which is a book that I've
3:27
been working on for a while and I think
3:29
really I'm giving myself about 20 to 30
3:33
000 more words I might be able to finish
3:35
it up in more like 18 000 but I'm just
3:39
gonna say 30 just in case I'm gonna
3:41
throw some things out and change some
3:43
things up so this is a young adult
3:45
psychological Thriller that has a bit of
3:49
either I guess unreliable narrator it's
3:51
my one of my favorite like fictional
3:54
things to read and so I'm trying it out
3:56
but we also have multiple povs so there
4:00
are at least eight points of view in
4:03
this and it's also a mixed timeline so
4:06
some of the stuff that happens is in the
4:09
past leading up to Vanessa's
4:10
disappearance and some of it is in the
4:13
future or in present day
4:15
so I was writing out all of those
4:17
character names and I am also now
4:20
writing out this Pages list here where I
4:23
can say what pages I'm planning to put
4:26
into this and so I'll be adding to this
4:28
potentially and then I think it might
4:31
become an index for just this particular
4:34
book originally I was thinking it would
4:37
be cool to have an entire strategy
4:40
notebook dedicated to each book that I
4:42
write but then when I started thinking
4:44
about it is 365 pages and I'm not sure
4:48
that I need that much space for every
4:51
single book that I'm writing so instead
4:54
it will either be series based or
4:57
similar types of books grouped together
4:59
in a notebook or it's going to be just
5:04
whatever I write this year and it'll be
5:06
a yearly kind of notebook and I'll just
5:08
decide that and figure it out as I go
5:09
but here what I'm doing is I'm creating
5:12
a Sprint tracker if you were around uh
5:16
Nano like a year and a half ago I
5:20
created this in my look term which you
5:23
can see there um the more yellow paper
5:25
there on the left side and I used it a
5:29
little bit so I think I did maybe 15 or
5:32
20 Sprints in it but I was going through
5:34
some really hard times at at that moment
5:37
and I was still we still weren't settled
5:38
we were living in airbnbs and I was
5:41
really struggling and that was another
5:43
attempt of mine to get back into the joy
5:45
of writing and it didn't fully work
5:48
because I was too distracted I was in
5:50
too much of I wouldn't say a depression
5:53
but I was really really caught up in a
5:55
lot of anxiety and so I just want to
5:57
encourage you that sometimes it can feel
6:00
like we're being a burden or that we're
6:03
being
6:05
I don't know Annoying or that because
6:07
we've tried and started and failed so we
6:10
think so many times like we haven't
6:13
followed through the way that we
6:15
originally planned and maybe we told
6:16
people that we were going to do it and
6:18
it can feel embarrassing or it can feel
6:20
frustrating to think oh my gosh am I the
6:23
kind of person who always tells people
6:24
that I'm going to try this thing
6:27
whatever it may be and then I don't
6:30
follow through and I just want to
6:32
encourage you that
6:33
I don't know if everyone does this maybe
6:36
there are some people who
6:38
follow through great with everything but
6:40
everybody I know has moments where they
6:44
try and it doesn't work out the way they
6:47
hoped and they have to start over and
6:49
they have to try again and sometimes
6:51
that means picking ourselves back up and
6:54
finding the spark again and figuring out
6:57
ways to get back to that place of I feel
6:59
inspired to work on this and so for me
7:02
it's you know setting up my stationery
7:05
and getting it the way I want it to be
7:06
and so I just want to encourage you that
7:08
if you feel like you've tried and failed
7:10
or started and stopped too many times
7:12
that I'm still gonna encourage you and
7:14
I'm still gonna be here with you so
7:16
let's do it together so that is the
7:19
pages that I'm gonna set up so you can
7:20
see I set up the Sprint tracker I also
7:23
set up this plotting tracker so I'm
7:24
going to plot put pieces of the plot
7:27
Which chapter it's in so if it's like
7:29
the uh mirror moment or something like
7:32
that I'll put that there and then I'm
7:34
gonna put information about the scenes
7:36
that I'm writing what the conflict is
7:39
the purpose of the scene and then any
7:41
other notes that I happen to have and
7:44
some of that structure also came from
7:46
Helen Redfern and I am going to link
7:49
some of her like story plotting videos
7:52
down below but I put a page in between
7:55
each of those sort of pieces of the ACT
7:58
I use the three-act structure but I
8:01
separate Act 2 into part one and part
8:03
two with the midpoint being in the
8:05
middle
8:06
so I will share with you as that begins
8:09
to sort of unfold or get put together
8:12
I'm going to use some page flags and
8:14
have that plot hopefully right there I
8:16
also keep track of my plot on my wall so
8:19
I'll be sharing more of that with you if
8:21
you're new here if you want to subscribe
8:22
I would love to have you as part of our
8:24
community in the month of April I'm
8:26
going to be doing this entire series
8:27
called writing writer reset and it's
8:30
going to be a series of Vlogs of getting
8:33
back to this joy and writing hopefully
8:35
the last of this book for Camp nanowrimo
8:38
so next week I will share with you sort
8:40
of my goals so there I was doing a tip
8:43
in this is also something I learned from
8:45
dakshina so again you'll find her links
8:47
down below but it's basically just
8:49
taking Vellum or acetate and using some
8:52
packing tape to insert it into your
8:55
Journal so this first notebook I think
8:58
I'm going to use as a writer reset
9:01
notebook like a journal for that just
9:03
for the reset portion of it like what
9:05
are the things I've tried and then I've
9:07
I don't know what I'm going to do with
9:08
that black notebook but this is a Erin
9:11
Condren perpetual calendar that I was
9:13
thinking maybe I could track my daily
9:14
word count in there but I don't show you
9:17
this but in the in the end when I went
9:19
through it again I was like you know
9:21
what I don't think I'm going to use that
9:22
and so I did pull it out so I just have
9:25
basically a journal and then I have my
9:27
basic stalagy so here I'm setting up
9:30
these pockets and I love Pockets if you
9:34
are new here you will find sometimes I
9:36
set up my A5 planners or other types of
9:40
planners and I always like to set up the
9:43
pockets with little ephemera and little
9:46
things I got from boxes or things I
9:48
bought off of etsy like that self-love
9:50
potion and the cosmic AF and the little
9:52
Coffee brew I got those off of a shop
9:54
from Etsy so I'll link those down below
9:56
I don't remember where I got the Alice
9:59
in Wonderland drink me one that is old
10:02
but the little Totoro Emoji is from the
10:04
coffee monsters Co and then the ollie
10:07
Clips there I love as well and this like
10:11
just decorating it is part of the spark
10:13
for me and
10:15
it may seem silly to some people if it's
10:17
not your thing because I know a lot of
10:19
people love minimalism and they love the
10:21
look of things just being really
10:22
streamlined and clean and so if that's
10:24
you then set it up streamlined and clean
10:27
and get something that makes you feel
10:28
inspired and excited so that keep
10:31
writing a little card that I had down
10:33
there is from procrasta planner and then
10:36
this cover here comes from Lauren Phelps
10:38
design and I just like to have a cover
10:40
so I can put my stickers and other
10:42
things in there so all of this is going
10:45
to go into this basic stalagy uh or B6
10:48
Chic Sparrow traveler's notebook and I
10:51
love to keep my plotting supplies as
10:54
much as I can that little hello coffee
10:55
was a gift from a fan in my mailbox and
10:59
so I want to put that on the notebook as
11:01
well a little bit more permanently but I
11:04
keep not deciding where I want to put it
11:06
so it just keeps traveling around with
11:07
me but part of getting these pockets and
11:10
stuff set up is often just trial and
11:12
error like bring out everything you have
11:15
has purple on it and see how it looks
11:18
um so that one thing that I cut up that
11:21
said Sarah Cannon is packing tape that I
11:23
used for a recent book signing and I
11:25
wanted to put it in my uh notebook as
11:28
well just to remind myself that like
11:29
there are people out there still waiting
11:31
for these books and they're excited for
11:32
them so I got this little tokidoki
11:34
purple pen at Daiso and I love it and so
11:37
I was just kind of taking a look at how
11:39
do I like how it feels and I was pretty
11:41
happy with it so then here I have this
11:43
little charm that says believe and has a
11:45
rose on it another gift in my mailbox so
11:47
thank you to everybody who has sent
11:49
gifts it means a lot and I do use them
11:51
and love them
11:54
um so here I have two other gifts and
11:57
this one has a bunch of dragonflies on
11:59
it and then I also have this one that is
12:02
more of like a uh junk you know they
12:05
call it like junk ribbon uh charm and so
12:08
I tried them both out and I have I think
12:10
another use for the dragonfly one so I'm
12:12
going to use this one that has a little
12:14
bit more um like softness to it so that
12:18
is it I'm all set up and I'm loving it
12:21
and I'm so happy and excited for this
12:24
chance to just get back to the spark to
12:27
share the process so if you also are
12:29
looking forward to getting yourself back
12:32
to a place where you're excited to write
12:33
every day where you're excited for your
12:35
stories then come join me for writer
12:37
reset we'll be doing Vlogs and just
12:40
sharing everything that I'm doing to
12:42
bring back my creativity after a period
12:44
of you know struggling to write so I've
12:48
created space for this in my schedule
12:49
I'm so excited for it so just a quick
12:51
little walk through here you have the
12:53
Washi dashboard some empty pages here
12:56
I've got the book cover I have a tagline
12:59
everyone had a reason to want Vanessa
13:01
gone including me I have character
13:04
sheets which I'll continue on the next
13:05
page then my Sprints to track and then
13:08
work to those plotting sheets I have one
13:10
for act one and then a page in between
13:12
act two part one and two and then act
13:15
three and on the pages in between I'm
13:17
gonna work on the timeline I'm going to
13:19
create a vision board here so I'll share
13:20
that with you and then I'm going to put
13:22
the April calendar in there and then the
13:24
rest of it will be part of the plot and
13:26
journaling so I am thrilled at how it
13:29
turned out I hope you enjoyed it too
13:30
I'll have all those links for you down
13:32
below and I will see you next week for
13:34

13:39
also don't forget to come join us in the
13:41
hb90 boot camp I would love to see you
13:43
in there it's open now and we start on
13:46
Sunday so find that link down below
13:48
alright I will see you guys soon
13:57
thank you
welcome back to heart breathings this is one of the videos I have been dying to make for a very long time and I am
0:06
excited to finally be making it which is what are the musthave best books on
0:12
writing so there are so many books out there about the craft of writing about
0:17
characters story structure dialogue everything you can imagine and there's so much wisdom out there that other
0:24
authors have shared with us and in some ways if you've ever heard of the concept of a slipstream this is the idea that
0:31
you can kind of fall in behind authors who have really done the work and figured this out and that will help you
0:37
advance much faster than you otherwise would have and that's what these authors have all done for me and my career and
0:43
my understanding of writing and craft and if you are a lifelong learner like
0:48
me and you really want to wrap your head around how to write the best stories that you can which ultimately is the
0:55
best way to Market your books and get your books into the hands of readers this is the video for you so let's get
1:06
started so like I said the number one most important thing that you can do to
1:11
get your books selling as much as in the Indie world we talk about Facebook ads and advertisements and social media
1:18
marketing and all the other marketing marketing is an important part of the process but nothing beats writing a
1:25
great book and the better your book is in terms of hooking in readers meeting genre expectations really learning the
1:32
craft of how to put together and create characters that people will care about
1:37
and worlds that people want to live in the more you can learn to do that the better your marketing will work the more
1:43
effective all of your marketing will be and the less marketing ultimately you'll have to do in your career because once
1:50
you've engaged a reader they will never leave you because they will know how great of a writer you are and that you
1:56
really deliver on your stories but learning how to do that is a challenge
2:02
and really it can already be a challenge just learning how to write a novel and finish a novel and then there's all this
2:09
other stuff that goes into it like writing great dialogue building amazing worlds building up magic systems having
2:15
your backstory created in just such a way that it's not an info dump but it's just perfectly put in and woven
2:22
throughout your story learning story structure which is one of the most challenging parts for many writers even
2:28
if readers can't identify aspects of story structure there is so much value in a reader intuitively
2:35
knowing when the pacing needs to change and when there needs to be a big event or a big twist or when the characters
2:41
need to admit that they love each other and when things are going to go wrong readers that have been reading for a
2:46
long time or consuming story for a long time intuitively know when to expect that and so as writers if we can deliver
2:53
on that because we have such a strong and deep understanding of when that needs to happen in the story then we're
2:59
going to create readers for life like true fans for life and there's no really
3:05
better resource out there other than Maybe YouTube where you can really learn
3:10
so much from so many other authors and that is through books on writing so
3:16
today what we're going to cover is what are my lists of books and we're going to cover in different segments of topics
3:23
like different sort of umbrellas of books what are the ones that I recommend that I have read that I know are quality
3:29
what are the books that I'm going to be reading coming up that I'll share with you in 2024 and then what are the five
3:35
books that I would say if these are the only five you can get a hold of here's the ones that I would recommend if you
3:41
haven't read them yet so this is going to be a great video I cannot wait to share it with you so let's talk about musthave writing books so before we go
3:49
into the musthaves in terms of books Let's talk about another musthave for authors in this day and age and that is
3:56
reliable cell phone service your mobile service is so important and that's why I want to say thank you to mintmobile for
4:03
partnering with me on today's video so my family and I made the switch over to mintmobile a couple of months ago and we
4:09
have definitely been putting it through the ringer so we've lived kind of out in the country plus we've been out at the
4:14
baseball fields traveling a lot in the car a lot and it's been so nice to have
4:20
unlimited data but also to have a service that's built on the nation's
4:26
largest 5G Network unlimited talk unlimited text and that unlimited data
4:31
has been so nice I have been streaming videos watching videos listening to
4:36
podcasts listening to our music in the car and this service has been so amazing
4:42
so we're getting the same Lightning Fast speeds that we were getting from our previous sell service but it's a
4:47
fraction of the cost and that's really one of the big benefits of mmobile they don't have retail stores but they still
4:53
have amazing customer service they also don't lock you into thousands of dollars worth of cell phone contracts so you can
5:01
come and go anytime you want and that is really part of what makes mmobile special because trust me once you get in
5:07
you're not going to want to leave because the prices are so good chances are you've probably seen some of the
5:12
funny ads with Ryan Reynolds who is one of the founders of mintmobile but this is no joke I am loving this service I
5:19
would love for you to give it a try so if you want to give it a shot now is the time their plans start as low as $15 a
5:27
month for unlimited talk unlimited text and their 5G wireless service and that's
5:32
for 5 gabes then it's only $30 for their Unlimited Plan per month but for a
5:37
limited time you can get those first three months of your unlimited plan for only $15 but you only have until the end
5:44
of October to sign up for that so definitely scan this QR code check and see if it's going to be right for you
5:50
they have family plans as well so you can get everyone in your family covered for a lower price than probably what
5:56
you're spending right now I also have my own link or you can click the link that's down in the description below if
6:01
you decide to give it a try definitely let me know you guys know I don't recommend things that I don't use and
6:07
love just like all the books that I'm going to be talking about today I am loving mintmobile and more than anything
6:12
I'm loving the fact that I've got the same great fast data service which is so important for me posting on social media
6:18
and keeping up with my fan base but lower cost so we could all use that these days so check it out and see if
6:25
it's right for your family it is available only in the United States I'm sorry to say but if you are here in the
6:30
US and you're looking for a great new phone service this is the one to check out so mintmobile is available for you
6:37
in this QR code or down in the description what we're going to do in terms of the books today is we are going
6:42
to look at them in sort of categories I thought about doing just like here's the
6:48
top five but what we're going to start out first is here's the overall categories and here's the books that I would recommend and why and I'm going to
6:54
go through them pretty quickly but I will also have an Amazon link for you down in the description below that is my
7:01
Amazon store and of course you can also try to find these books a lot of them are going to be available at your local
7:07
library so first we're going to just talk about the general idea of writing
Writing Addictive Stories
7:12
stories that become addictive and what are some of my favorite books on writing
7:18
just great stories so in these books they will cover things like structure but they're also going to be really
7:24
talking about the psychology of readers tropes and expectations pacing and this
7:29
kind of thing so the very first book I read like this which Eevee has colored on I don't know if that'll show up on
7:35
here there's so many things that I have children that have written on but I love it is this book writing the breakout
7:41
novel there is a workbook that goes along with this this is by Donald Moss who is an agent and he really knows his
7:48
stuff he also has other books like the fire and fiction and the emotional craft of fiction that I would recommend but this is the one that goes on my list
7:54
today writing the breakout novel was one of the first books that I read that really helped me connect what it means
8:01
to write a book that is binge worthy something that people really are not going to be able to put down it is so
8:06
good it also like most of these books has a really good index in the back so you can look it up by topic but there
8:12
are checklists in here and one of the biggest things that I learned from this book really is all about pacing which if
8:19
we have time we'll talk about that here during nanor rimo or preptober but it also talks a lot about stakes and it
8:26
talks about personal Stakes versus global Stakes versus Community stakes and I think understanding what's at
8:33
stake in a book is so important to getting people to read your book and not be able to stop turning pages so pacing
8:39
stakes and understanding what makes a book bingeable writing the breakout novel another one that is a more recent
8:46
read for me is Lisa kon's story genius so this one actually goes deeper into
8:51
structure but she also is really talking about the psychology of readers and
8:57
writing and what we can do as writers to tap into reader expectations the binge
9:03
ability of books the Resonance of books that emotional side of it but she also goes into a lot about characters as well
9:10
as scenes and when we talk about writing great scenes that you can't put down that you just want to keep reading this
9:16
is the book highly recommend story genius by Lisa cron again she also has lots of other books and I haven't read
9:22
any of her others but I have them I've purchased them and they're next on my list another one that you won't want to
9:28
miss this is a super short one and written by an indie author Theodora Taylor who I also love She's number one
9:34
futuristic like me we're friends I just love her is seven fig fiction so if you
9:39
ever hear anybody in the writer World talking about butter they're probably talking about Theodora Taylor so in this
9:45
book she goes into a lot of things like tropes and what makes stories really have that Universal appeal to them so
9:53
often even if it's not part of their like true awareness readers are constantly drawn to stories that have
9:59
this Universal appeal and there are certain types of stories and themes and things like that that if we explore them
10:05
in our fiction they're more likely to get people really interested in it it also talks about reader expectations and
10:12
how we can really lean into that and this really goes hand inand with some of
10:17
what Jennifer Lynn Barnes has talked about at rwas and other presentations if you ever get your hands on some of her
10:23
work talking about the ID that goes hand inand with this but if you want to learn about butter check out Theodore Taylor
10:30
and she does actually have a course that goes along with this as well the final one that is in this category for me is
10:36
John Tres the anatomy of story so this one is really like we're going to kind
10:42
of move into this area and this uh we're going to move into this category of
10:47
screenwriting to help you as a fiction writer but really John truy comes from that world of screenwriters as well but
10:54
here's what is cool about this so he talks about the different points in your story and he also gives you tons of
11:01
examples from things like jaws and Harry Potter and Silence of the Lambs and other type of popular fiction and
11:08
sometimes I find that the better the examples are in the books in terms of here's what I'm saying and then here's
11:14
why it works and here's a place where you can see where it's working it really has that connection for me which is why
11:20
I try to give a lot of examples when I'm teaching about story as well this book does a great job of pulling in those
11:26
examples that I'm familiar with sometimes the examples and books are things I don't know and I don't have the
11:31
time to go read five other books that I haven't recognized before but this is going to be full of movies and things
11:37
that you do understand there's also a lot of like checklists and tropes and things like that in here there's a lot
11:42
on theme and just basically what makes a story tick so anatomy of Story by John truy continuing on with this idea of
Screenwriting Books
11:50
like what makes a story great and bingeable we have to talk about story structure so story structure is
11:57
basically your plot and how you're arranging the elements of your plot in
12:02
order to say here's what happens in the story and of course one of the greatest places that we can learn in terms of
12:09
craft when it comes to story structure and fast pacing is from people that have studied how to write movies and
12:15
television so a lot of times the place we can look for great writing advice is going to be from screenwriters so when
12:23
we start talking about that you could have a dozen or more books that you might find probably hundreds of books at
12:29
this point written by screenwriters trying to teach us how to use the techniques of screenwriters to write
12:36
better fiction and so one of the first ones that I read is sidf feel's book
12:41
called screenplay so this is the foundations of screenwriting and he says here um in the subtitle a step-by-step
12:48
guide from concept to finished script and really this is going to talk a lot about like how to set up your story how
12:55
the beginning is one of the most important parts it's going to talk a a lot about visual storytelling and how
13:01
you can really bring your reader in so they're seeing it like a movie in their head now of course the what Sid field is
13:08
talking about is actual visual on the screen but we can easily pull that in
13:13
and make it visual in our imaginations and so I think a lot of this is really really valuable and again talks about
13:20
plot points and the four four act threea structure so Sid field screenwriting is an amazing book then we have one of my
13:28
favorite mentors and teachers is Michael heg so he has a book called writing screenplays that sell and I have to tell
13:35
you I have heard him speak on multiple occasions and when he talks about your character's ghost or wounds and how that
13:42
informs your story and so much of what he says about how to really craft a
13:48
story that has emotional re resonance is so important this is just someone to me
13:54
who really understands the business of Storytelling but doesn't make it just soulless he's able to infuse so much
14:02
Soul into his teaching and last I heard Michael heg did also offer private sort
14:08
of consultations so you might be able to find uh a chance to do some private consultations but there's some like
14:14
example screenwriting in here there are um just sort of like talking about how
14:20
you can Infuse the story with humor but then also make it resonate talking about the emotion and there's just some real
14:26
practical advice here on writing screenplays that sell where it's not just about writing the story but about
14:31
writing the story in such a way that people are going to want to buy it which is what I mean when I'm talking about
14:37
marketing being baked into your story just as a side thing also Sid field does
14:43
have a screenwriters workbook where there is more information about writing
14:48
great characters and a lot more kind of like exercises if you want to check that out another great book from
14:55
screenwriters on writing that almost everyone is familiar with is Blake Snider's save the cat so in save the cat
15:03
Blake Snider goes through some very specific like types of story and then
15:08
the story beats that you might go through which is very different than what you might find in a normal novel
15:14
writing version of story structure and so one of the valuable resources that
15:20
has come out of Blake Snider save the cat is Jessica Brody's save the cat writes a novel so Jessica Brody is a
15:27
young adult author author who has studied with Blake Snider in the past and then was allowed and um given the
15:35
rights to go out and teach different workshops on this so she knows her stuff inside and out Jessica Brody also has
15:42
her own subscription for learning craft so if you want to check that out you can just search for her name or I'll try to
15:48
find a link for it down below but if you want to take what you what is written in
15:54
Blake Snider save the cat in terms of those story beats and really see how do you apply that that to fiction writing
16:00
this is the book you want to check out save the cat writes a novel speaking of books that I know a lot of screenwriters
16:07
talk about but that I haven't actually read yet but I picked up recently is the writer's journey by Christopher voglar
16:13
so this is definitely another thing where you're going to see a lot of
16:18
different tropes and elements of story and different pieces of Story character
16:24
arcs character questions things to ask lots of uh Tech teques and things you
16:29
can work through but this is a beefy book so this is one of the next ones on my list recommend you picking up because
16:35
it's one of the trid and true type of resources that people have referred to for years okay now we kind of move into
Structure
16:42
some other fiction writing resources on structure that are less focused on
16:48
screenwriting so one of them that I would say is in my top five books of must reads is scene and structure by
16:55
Jack bickham so this is one of those structural books books where you really get into scenes themselves so a lot of
17:01
the books that we'll talk about in terms of screenwriting and plot and structure and things like that are all about the
17:08
overarching like three act or four-part structure of the novel this book scene in structure is one of the first ones
17:14
that I ever read that gets into the nitty-gritty of scene and Sequel and how you actually craft your scenes and
17:21
really make sure that your your goals and your conflicts for your character are just a part of those scenes and
17:27
again this is a great book if you're wanting to write bingeable fiction so highly recommend scene and structure by
17:32
Jack bickham this is on my top five list another great book on structure is story
17:37
engineering by Larry Brooks so this he says is about mastering the six core
17:43
competencies of successful writing so this is all about um let me read from
17:49
the back cover what those competencies are concept character theme and story
17:54
structure which is your plot and then executional comp competencies of scene structure and your writing voice I could
18:01
not agree more that all six of these things are foundational and core elements to writing Amazing Stories
18:07
because these are all things that weave in together and I find that we talk so much about plot that we're like the
18:13
first door way and the midpoint and these kind of things that sometimes we aren't sure how to weave all that
18:19
together with our theme and our characters and our goals and the real
18:24
voice that we're trying to put into this fiction along with the genre and how we actually craft individual scenes so this
18:31
is the book that you're going to want to read and even though this looks kind of like a shorter book the words in this
18:36
particular version of the paperback are quite like small so this is one that's a bit dense and can take some time to get
18:42
through because it's so packed with information but it's definitely one I would highly recommend one of the very
18:47
first books that I ever picked up or really first series of books that I ever picked up were these write great fiction
18:54
series books and this is actually where I first discovered James Scott Bell as well which is one of my favorite sort of
19:00
writing mentors of all time so he wrote James Scott Bell wrote this book plot and structure this is definitely an
19:08
amazing easy to understand book with lots of really good examples and also
19:14
like there are different charts and other things like flowcharts in here and there's just sort of visuals that help
19:22
you along the way to really understand it so I feel like this is one book that is easily digestible in terms of
19:29
understanding plot and structure so this was the first introduction I ever got into the act one doorway and the second
19:35
doorway and the midpoint and things like that but then James Scott Bell who I told you that I love I highly recommend
19:42
following him on social media and any books that he puts out or any chance you might get to hear him speak because he's
19:48
brilliant um also his book super structure so the first thing that I discovered from him past this was a book
19:55
called Write your novel from the Middle where he talks specific specifically about this idea of a mirror moment or a
20:01
moment in the middle of your book that's not just the plot point but that is an internal character beat and that really
20:08
resonated with me because I realized that intuitively I have been putting this in my books but I wasn't able to
20:15
like sometimes we might do things structurally that are intuitive that we feel needs to be in the story but until
20:21
we really understand why we're doing it and the best way to craft it it might not be as strong or emotionally resonant
20:28
as it could be so these books can really be a way to sharpen your blade so to
20:33
speak to really take what you're already doing intuitively and make it that much stronger intentionally because now you
20:40
understand and I understand also as I say that I'm going to always put out the caveat here that this is not true for
20:47
everyone some people maybe understanding and getting into the weeds of the details is so confusing or it's not the
20:54
way your brain works that it actually muddles you up so don't feel guil gu y if it's like these books don't mean
21:00
anything to me I do better on my own because some people are just intuitive writers so just cuz I get excited about
21:06
it doesn't mean I'm judging anyone who doesn't find Value in books like these
21:11
just remember that it's always about your own process and if you feel excited when you're reading stuff like this then
21:17
go for it if it makes you feel like it's making your writing more difficult then it's totally okay to just not read these
21:24
books and keep writing intuitively but for those of us that are lifelong learners
21:29
I talked about futuristic in terms of Clifton strengths for those of you that are familiar with Becca Sim's work
21:34
learner is also in my top five so it's always something that I'm thinking about but after he wrote write your novel from
21:41
the middle so many people were interested in the way that he was looking at these story structure beats that he went on to write this book
21:47
called Super structure super super short it's also I believe last I looked it was in Kindle unlimited if you wanted to
21:53
pick it up that way but it's also the paperback itself is not very expensive but it is packed with such great
22:00
information about understanding story structure the biggest downside of this book is that it's kind of a wasteland in
22:07
act two you have the act one doorway and then you kind of have the midpoint and there's not a lot of guidance here about
22:14
what happens in between those two points so there's other books that can fill in
22:19
the gaps there but he talks basically about like I think it's like seven main story beats that you don't need to miss
22:26
in your story and these just the way he teaches and the way he explained it made it really click for me so highly
22:32
recommend super structure by James Scott Bell and plot instructure also by James Scott Bell as a bit of a beefier version
22:40
of this but he wrote this long before he ever wrote super structure so you won't find some of the same midpoint and
22:45
mirror moment things in this book a few other structure books that I have available in Kindle but not in paperback
22:52
and I'm like why do I not have these in paperback I need to remedy this but one of them is my ab absolute favorite which
22:58
I feel like I do have in paperback somewhere but it's missing is structuring your novel by km wiland
23:05
again if you're looking for mentors and people that you can follow that really know what they're talking about and have
23:11
such a great way of teaching km wand is one of the best she has a website called
23:17
Helping writers become authors something along those lines I will link her stuff down below but she's brilliant highly
23:24
recommend that you go right now and sign up for her newsletter list and check out as many books of hers as you can she
23:30
often has published these mostly independently so Indie published and she will often have the book itself like
23:37
structuring your novel and then there will be a structuring your novel workbook so if you want to check out those and try your own hand at some of
23:43
the like actually applying some of the concepts that she talks about highly recommend it now she does also have a
23:49
book called outlining your novel I did not find that one as helpful as structuring your novel because in
23:55
structuring your novel she goes through the plot points and the true structure of your book and I just found that the
24:01
way that she explains the plot points is really really well done structuring your novel is also on my list of top five
24:08
must buy books I'm also going to mention two books that are structural but for
24:14
specific genres so the first one is Romancing The Beat by Gwen Hayes so this
24:20
is a musthave for any romance writer like no matter what genre of romance you're writing you need to go and get
24:26
this book again it is a shorter book but it is packed with such valuable information that to me if if you were
24:33
only wanting to buy one book and you're writing Romance by Romancing The Beat by Gwen Hayes she goes into the story
24:40
structure and beats for romance specifically which I find is something that a lot of these other books on plot
24:46
sort of talk more about mystery or young adult books or genre fiction or literary
24:52
fiction or other things like that but they don't necessarily cover romance specifically which has a slightly
24:58
different structure because you've got that dual point of view and each character has their own arc so highly
25:03
recommend Romancing The Beat by Gwen Hayes another structural book in that same vein is how to write a damn good
25:10
mystery by James fry he also has such a great way basically talking about
25:16
reverse engineering your mystery novel this is something that I have used even
25:22
as a contemporary fantasy author or a portal fantasy author because even though my books portal Fantasy A lot of
25:29
them the actual structure of each individual book is a mystery so and of course disappearance of Vanessa Shaw is
25:35
also mystery so I often find myself writing in a mystery structure but with this fantasy
25:42
overarching structure so how to write a damn good mystery is really one of the best out there for writing mystery okay
25:49
so let's talk about creating characters because there are also a lot of really helpful books on creating characters one
25:56
of the best true resources for creating great characters and learning how to describe their emotions is the emotion
Characters
26:04
thesaurus by arriman and pugy Becca Pugi and Angela arriman I believe are their
26:10
full names they have so many of these the thesauruses negative traits
26:15
thesaurus like um villain the thesaurus basically these books are a way to say
26:22
if your character is feeling this here's some ways that you can describe this if your
26:28
setting is like this here's some way that you can describe it so this goes both into character as well as setting
26:33
but these books are Priceless in terms of getting your brain kind of going and thinking through how can I describe this
26:40
how can I show this on the page because you know as writers we hear it all the time show don't tell and so this is
26:47
really a way to get the emotion on the page without saying he felt this way you
26:52
would say he did this or he looked this way or he you know took took this action
26:58
or his body language was such a way and that tells the reader how your character's Feeling by showing them
27:04
instead of telling them highly recommend the emotion thesaurus which was the first one they put out and probably the
27:10
one that I referen the most but check out their entire library of helpful resources for authors another one from
27:17
that same right great fiction series that was an earlier book I don't even know when these were published but I have to say they probably were 15 years
27:24
ago or more so let's see this one was published in 200 VI so these are older books but they're Timeless so character
27:31
emotion and Viewpoint by NA Nancy Crest is another really great digestible like
27:36
I think this right great fiction series was put together really well now these to me are more for kind of beginning
27:43
introduction type of things they don't go as into depth but really everything you need to know is in these books but
27:49
it's presented in such an easy to understand type of way so character emotion and Viewpoint is going to go
27:54
over the different types of point of view like third person versus first person versus third person omniscient
28:00
and what does all those types of things mean and how does that play into your story but also how to craft your
28:06
characters how to work on putting their emotion and their internal monologue
28:11
into the story so this is a great one for that another one of course that I just recently talked about that also
28:17
goes into character but talking specifically about how to get your character speaking on the page is
28:23
dialogue and this one is by Gloria Kempton and so another one of that same type of
28:29
series another couple of books that I recommend for when you're working on your characters so this is also one that
28:36
I have seen in reference to screenwriting but also romance specifically but this is good for
28:42
anytime you're trying to plan out your characters which is the complete writer's guide to Heroes and heroins so
28:49
this is really a book about 16 main like Master archetypes so if you've been
28:54
wanting to have a way to really craft your characters according to archetypes this is the book again really easy to
29:01
digest very short book where it basically is just saying like here's the archetype like the Wai and then here's
29:08
how that archetype often shows up when in terms of their values their backstory
29:14
their ghost or wound here's how that person often displays their flaws here's
29:19
the type or style of Wai you might find and then when that Wai falls in love
29:24
with this kind of person that's where the romance really come in here's how that can show up on the on the page but
29:31
you often get like here's the type of occupation they might have now the warning that I have about this particular book is just simply that you
29:37
don't want to get so trapped into they say the Wai should have these kind of jobs to make it very prescriptive these
29:44
are just examples that you can draw from to get your imagination going but if you really want to have a fundamental
29:49
understanding of archetypes in general to help you craft your characters check out the complete writer's guide to
29:56
Heroes and heroins and of course in any discussion on writing books I'm always going to come
30:02
back to km wiland I hope someday I get to meet her because I think she's just brilliant and she has one of the best
30:07
books out there on characters which is creating character arts and like I had mentioned she often has workbooks that
30:14
go along with her books that have actual exercises where you can put what she's
30:20
taught you into play and try it out and experiment with it and try to learn more from it so the subtitle for this book is
30:27
the masterful author's guide to uniting story structure plot and character development and that really is exactly
30:33
what this is so often when you hear people talk about characters so for example in this book we're just talking
30:39
about the archetype and the characters Journey but this book is unique in that it takes you through how do you weave
30:46
that character Arc into the actual plot and action of the story and that's where
30:51
the value of this comes in because she's going to marry plot points and she's going to say by this time in the story
30:58
when you hit this structurally here's what should be going on with your characters and this for me to be honest
31:04
when I first read this book several years ago it was a little bit over my head and I had to just trust that I
31:11
could understand kind of everything she was saying but I come back to this book over and over again just to continue to
31:18
strengthen my character work and how that weaves into the plot I would love
31:23
km wiland if you ever see this video to see something Ong this lines of how do you weave this into a whole series as
31:31
well as multiple POV books so she does touch on series and she does touch on
31:36
multiple POV but I would I would love to learn more right now I'm just learning by reading or by reading other Masters
31:44
who have written fiction but not necessarily books on how to do it and there's just not as many great resources
31:50
out there if any on writing great multiple POV outside of romance so I'm
31:56
looking for that I'm crossing my fingers for that but if you are looking for a great book on how to craft characters
32:01
and how to actually weave your characters Arc in with the plot of your book this is a must have creating
32:07
character arcs by km wiland and one of my top five for every writer must have
32:13
must pick up is another book that is going to help you craft your character Arc and your story in general and that
32:19
is goal motivation and Conflict by Deborah Dixon I don't have this one in paperback I think either I only have it
32:25
in Kindle but this is one of those books that really takes you through how to
32:31
craft your character's goal how what motivates them to want that goal and then what's the conflict that's holding
32:37
them back from that goal and the way that she walks you through this in this book is so clear and it's just brilliant
32:44
so highly recommend goal motivation and conflict this is going to help you not only with your story structure but crafting your character and weaving
32:51
those things in together but it's really going to help you to create characters that people care about and they're
32:57
cheering for and they want to see that character change and grow and it's just
Editing
33:03
so great goal motivation Conflict by debor Dixon is one of my top five musthaves okay final category for today
33:10
is books on how to edit your novel once you've got the book written how in the world do you edit it well sometimes we
33:18
have to do that first as our own like most of the time we are going to pass our book over to Beta readers critique
33:24
Partners as well as professional editors whether you're using a developmental editor or like a copy editor and a proof
33:30
reader but if you want to get the most out of your proof reader and copy editor you need to get really good at editing
33:37
your own novel so that means understanding punctuation so I do have the book that I recommended to you guys
33:43
last week which is the best book the best punctuation book period as well as
33:48
the elements of Style by Shunk and white so this is more formal and kind of goes
33:54
into writing papers and other things as well the best punctuation book period is more of a modern take on punctuation and
34:02
it's really good um for like how do you hyphenate words how do you use um
34:08
acronyms and other things in your punctuation so this is just really both of these are just really good kind of
34:14
like resource manual type books that you might want to check out another book even though this book says for children
34:21
and young adult authors this book I think is valuable for everyone and it is
34:27
um Cheryl B Klein's uh second site so she said an editor talks on writing and
34:32
revision and Publishing books for children and young adults but this book to me is so full of examples of why
34:40
certain book series were as popular as they are how to really write characters and really how to get in the second site
34:46
is really an editor's Viewpoint of how to take your draft and polish it up to make it where it resonates where it's
34:53
page Turner where it really hits the mark in terms of what you were trying to do with your genre and though a lot of
34:59
the examples will be more Children's picture books and if you're writing a picture book you got to pick this one up
35:05
but it will apply a little bit more to young adult books but I highly recommend this for every writer in terms of
35:11
learning how to better edit your books and one of the most valuable books that I've ever seen and read on editing is
35:19
self-editing for fiction writers and right now I can I didn't write down the author so I will put that in the
35:25
description down below but self- editing for fiction writers is one of the first books I ever got on editing and it is
35:31
still to this day one of my favorites because it really goes through how to self-edit your books no not only with
35:37
the grammar but how to make your sentences cleaner how to cut out unnecessary words how to make sure that
35:43
your plot is cohesive and consistent highly recommend that book as well so you've got lots of books here for you to
35:49
get started but let me talk about my top five that I would recommend before we go okay so obviously these are all going to
Top 5 Recommendations
35:56
be five that I've already recommended but I'm just going to give them to you so you know story genius Lisa cron this
36:01
is one of my more recent additions to this list but to me this goes so deep into psychology and scene structure that
36:08
it's a mustre if you are a newer author though this might be a little bit heavy reading for you so you might want to
36:14
check out the other four on the list so super structure by James Scott Bell super quick read but especially if you
36:20
are new to story structure this is going to make it seem so simple but like I said there's a lot of missing pieces is
36:27
here so you might just this is really going to help you get those like milestones and temp PES down and then
36:32
you're going to need something like story structure or story genius to kind of fill in those holes scene and
36:37
structure is going to be another good one for you to start filling in the holes of how to write scenes but to me again a short book that is packed with
36:44
some of the best advice in the industry goal motivation and Conflict by Deborah Dixon this is going to help you
36:50
understand your characters and write books that just have that motivation baked in so you feel something for these
36:57
characters you know what's at stake for them and then of course top book for everybody if you can only pick up one is
37:03
structuring your novel by km wand I love this book it's it's similar in terms of
37:09
some of the content to Super structure but the way she describes things the examples that she gives is going to take
37:16
you a little bit further and of course any of the other ones on this list if you're looking for something more specific if you want to understand
37:22
Viewpoint or you want to understand editing better or any of those other tops ICS definitely check out the other
37:28
books on this list of course we only have a short period of time before nanor rimo is upon us we have a week yet to go
37:35
I'm hoping to still get a video out about some of my other musthaves like some of the tools and keyboards and
37:41
other things that I use if I don't cover them before Nano begins I will cover them during my daily Vlogs called the
37:47
Nano rimo Diaries which start November 2nd so the way this will work is every single day during the month of November
37:54
I will record a vlog on my journey to write 50,000 words in just 30 days and
37:59
so day one's blog will get edited and we'll go live on day two and there'll be a day behind throughout the entire month
38:06
of November every single day I do have some previous Vlogs if you want to check those out as well as previous years
38:13
where I've discussed all of the stuff on preptober um so if you want to check out some of those videos I will have all of
38:18
those playlists down below also don't forget to check out my partner mintmobile if you're interested in a
38:24
powerful but in expensive mobile service for your phone definitely check that out let me know what your favorite must have
38:32
books on for writing because your list might be very different from mine so let's help each other out by continuing
38:37
to build on this list and I'll probably pick up some of your recommendations I also have an entire stack of books that
38:45
I'm going to be reading in 2024 as I continue to learn and stay on my journey of becoming a better writer so I'll be
38:51
sharing that as we get into December and talking about 2024 goals all right thank you all so much for hanging out with me
38:57

bye [Music]


hey guys welcome back to heart
0:02
breathing's today I am so excited to
0:04
show you a complete flip through of my
0:07
custom-designed
0:08
HP 90 method planner that is a planner
0:10
for creative entrepreneurs and mainly
0:12
for writers but it can apply to anyone
0:14
who is really setting goals and it has
0:16
over 40 pages of goal setting pages and
0:19
then it has a monthly weekly and a daily
0:22
planner all included in a principle and
0:24
I will explain kind of what sizes and
0:27
everything you get with it and show you
0:28
just basically the walk through of all
0:30
these goal-setting pages this is a
0:32
system that has single-handedly
0:33
transformed of my life and helps me to
0:36
have one of the most productive most
0:39
joyful at least stressed years of my
0:41
life and I would love for you to take a
0:44
look at it if you've been interested in
0:45
seeing what is in the custom planner if
0:47
you're interested in purchasing this
0:48
planner you can find links to it down
0:51
below it's for sale right now on Etsy
0:52
and there is both a dated planner for q1
0:56
of 2019 as well as the undated planner
0:58
that you can print over and over for any
1:00
quarter and if you've been interested in
1:02
my videos that I've done about the
1:04
Kanban board and stuff like that this
1:06
planner kind of teaches you how to set
1:07
up the Kanban board and set your goals
1:09
for the quarter so here we go I'm going
1:11
to show you a walkthrough of this custom
1:13
planner it is more than just you know
HB90 Method
1:19
monthly it has monthly weekly and daily
1:21
pages but it's more than just that it's
1:23
an entire goal-setting system that helps
1:27
you to plan a for 90 day cents which is
1:29
what's the HP 90 method heart
1:31
breathing's 90 day system and this is
1:33
the Q 1 2019 planner that just has gone
1:36
up in Etsy and I will link that down
1:38
below if you're interested in grabbing
1:39
it you will need a printer it has some
1:42
color in it so if you send it out to
1:44
print it at like staples or whatever
1:45
just make sure you get a quote of the
1:47
price first because it can be pricey
1:49
just print a color document at Staples
1:52
but if you have a printer at home it's
1:53
super easy to print it will come in the
1:56
a5 version and the letter size version
1:58
which is like more of the full size
2:00
sheet all in the same download so you
2:02
could use it either way so basically the
2:06
q1 planner walks you through a whole
Q1 Planner
2:10
goal-setting system so there's quote
2:12
pages like this one
2:13
from CS Lewis that says there are far
2:15
far better things ahead than any we
2:17
leave behind which I felt was great for
2:19
the beginning of the year then it has
2:21
goal-setting pages that sort of walk you
2:23
through how to use the planner so you'll
2:26
see those in you know every few pages
2:27
you'll see directions and then I have in
2:31
this particular planner a 20-18 review
2:33
that really asks you to reflect on the
2:36
previous year and then so there's four
2:40
pages of review then another quote page
2:44
then there's a vision statement segment
2:47
so part of my system is really not only
2:49
reviewing the last year but also getting
2:52
a vision of what your ideal life looks
2:54
like so I asked you a lot of questions
2:56
about your ideal life what matters most
2:58
to you what do you want to accomplish
2:59
because when you set goals you you know
3:04
need to know kind of where you're headed
3:05
what's your vision for your life then
3:07
you've got some other segments here and
3:09
you might not be able to see this super
3:10
well from that distance but let me see
3:14
if you can see if I go closer up I don't
3:16
know if you guys can see that but there
3:18
is a very light dot grid on this I think
3:21
you can see it a little bit so there is
3:23
a dot grid here for you to kind of guide
3:27
your drawings and stuff like that so
3:30
it's got the journaling pages then it
3:31
has like a page here to get specific
3:33
about what your ideal day looks like and
3:35
feels like and then again this is all
3:38
dot grid pages and this is where I want
3:40
you to put together a vision board with
3:42
images and words and how you really see
3:45
your dream life so it walks you through
3:47
all of that sorry this little segment
3:51
these rings are not perfect right here
3:53
I've noticed with this Webster's pages
3:55
and I've really got it packed so it's
3:58
not um turning super easily then you've
4:01
got a section to declutter your brain
4:03
and it walks you through why we're doing
4:05
it how you're going to do it so then I'm
4:07
going to ask you to make three lists
4:08
what you need to do all the things that
4:10
you feel you should be doing in your
4:12
business in your life and all the things
4:13
that you really kind of want to do and
4:15
haven't had time for then in this system
4:18
I've got this priority box here that
4:21
walks you through everything you just
4:24
put on these lists
4:26
and asks you to prioritize them
4:28
according to this box so I've got all
4:30
the instructions of how it works and
4:32
examples and that sort of thing
4:35
another quote page and then before we
4:38
can actually set your goals you're going
4:40
to look realistically at your time
4:42
schedule which I have this time
4:45
estimator which again I have
4:46
instructions here that walk you through
4:48
how to use the time estimator but
4:50
basically what you're doing is you're
4:51
looking ahead to the next quarter which
4:53
is January February in March there are
4:55
90 days in the quarter exactly and
4:57
you're going to look and you're going to
4:59
mark off all the days you know you're
5:00
not going to be working or like weekends
5:02
or like my birthday is January 23rd so
5:05
I'd probably mark that day off and not a
5:07
working day and then you look at how
5:09
many days you're actually going to be
5:10
able to work so that you can be
5:11
realistic if you are an entrepreneur
5:13
then you understand that a lot of us are
5:16
not realistic about our time we think oh
5:18
I've got three months to get that done
5:20
or I've got a year to get that done and
5:21
we we think we can write like ten books
5:23
in a year or whatever ridiculous amount
5:25
of things instead of looking
5:27
realistically at time so that's why we
5:28
do the time estimator then there's a
5:31
section here for writing out your
5:33
ongoing tasks which these are things
5:35
that you're already doing in routine so
5:37
for example you might be posting to a
5:40
Facebook group every day or you might
5:41
already have a routine of spending ten
5:43
minutes posting to Instagram every day
5:45
but anything that's like considered an
5:47
ongoing task not your writing
5:49
specifically or like your work tasks but
5:51
the more like admin type tasks like oh I
5:54
look at my email every day or that kind
5:56
of thing and how much time do you spend
5:58
doing it then I have an exercise that
6:00
walks you through your ideal week and I
6:03
have an example of like my ideal
6:04
schedule and we talk about theme days
6:06
and different things like that and then
6:08
you've got a section here where you can
6:10
work out your own ideal weekly schedule
6:13
more quote pages and then we get to the
6:16
actual goal-setting work so you can see
6:18
like going through this planner really
6:21
walks you through a system of how to
6:23
figure out what your ideal vision for
6:26
your life is and then how to take a
6:28
realistic look at the time you have and
6:30
all the things you need to be doing and
6:32
figure out exactly what kind of goals
6:35
you need to be working toward so inside
6:37
this planner I discuss the difference
6:39
between a goal
6:40
a project in a task and give lots of
6:44
good examples on what's the difference
6:46
between a goal and a project and that is
6:50
going to help you brainstorm on these
6:52
pages which has more dot grid brainstorm
6:57
potential goals for yourself and then
7:02
what you actually do now that we get to
7:04
this page is you're gonna actually set
7:07
your three goals and in my system there
7:10
are only three goals and one of the big
7:12
things is a differentiator between you
7:15
know goal is not I'm going to write
7:16
three books a goal is I'm gonna increase
7:19
my income to five thousand dollars a
7:20
month and then a project that would help
7:23
you increase your income is the writing
7:25
of the books and that kind of
7:27
oversimplifies it but if you get the
7:29
planner and you want to look at this
7:30
system or if you want to join my heart
7:32
breathing's 90-day boot camp it's it's a
7:35
three-day boot camp teaching you how to
7:36
plan 90 days according to this system
7:38
I'll walk you through the difference
7:40
between a goal and a project and how
7:42
figuring out which things should be your
7:43
goal and which kinds of projects will
7:45
help support those goals but if you get
7:47
the planner it kind of walks you through
7:49
a lot of the system then you've got a
7:52
section here for its kind of like a
7:53
future idea parking lot where you can
7:55
put some of your future ideas for like
7:58
q2 q3 and q4 of next year and q1 of 2020
8:02
so it kind of allows you to sort of
8:03
sketch out what you might be doing in
8:05
the future so that you can only focus on
8:07
the things that are your goals and
8:09
projects for this quarter but you kind
8:11
of know what's coming up for you in the
8:13
future
8:14
then I have more explanation of how you
8:20
take a look at the time that you have
8:22
that we estimated how much time you have
8:24
how you can figure out how many projects
8:25
you can fit into the actual time you
8:27
have and you know how you break those
8:30
projects down into tasks another quote
8:33
page and then here's your project
8:36
brainstorming where you take like your
8:38
first goal let's say your first goal was
8:40
to increase your income to $5,000 a
8:42
month then you would choose which
8:44
projects you're going to work on this 90
8:46
days only that are going to help you hit
8:48
the goal of making $5,000 a month so
8:51
these projects will be specifically
8:53
to trying to make more money so this
8:56
would be maybe where you're like
8:58
promoting your back list or writing more
9:01
books and publishing more books
9:03
coordinating with other authors like
9:05
cross-promotion it may be working on
9:07
your newsletter list so that you can get
9:08
more sales out of the people that are
9:10
already on your list or let's say you
9:12
aren't a working writer you're just
9:14
someone who writes in your spare time
9:16
and you've got a full time job goal
9:18
number one might be to increase your
9:21
writing productivity by 50% this next
9:24
quarter so all of these projects would
9:26
be relating to getting more focused on
9:29
your writing so one of your projects
9:31
might be to write 500 words a day
9:33
hopefully that kind of makes sense so
9:35
you break down that goal into projects
9:37
that help you achieve that goal so here
9:39
you're kind of brainstorming how many
9:41
projects like all the projects you could
9:42
think of and you're writing down how
9:44
many days you think it's going to take
9:46
to complete each project according to
9:47
goal one two three and then there's just
9:49
an extra page in case you need to print
9:51
more of them then here's where you
9:53
actually set your final goals so you
9:55
write your goal the project that you
9:57
know cause like maybe when you're
9:59
filling out this project brainstorm
10:01
you're gonna find out that you have
10:02
let's say 70 working days this quarter
10:06
but it would take you 500 days to
10:08
complete all the projects you thought
10:09
you were going to try to do and that's
10:11
there where the realistic time frame
10:12
comes in and the estimates come in
10:14
because you can say okay I only have 70
10:17
days so I can only pick the most
10:18
important projects to focus on that will
10:20
take me no more than 70 days to complete
10:22
so then once you've marked off the ones
10:26
that you know maybe you'll do in the
10:27
future or you don't have time for this
10:28
quarter this is where you actually set
10:30
up which projects and decide which
10:32
projects and if you want to you can
10:34
write a starting date when you plan to
10:36
finish it and how much time it's going
10:37
to take you and then there's another
10:39
little dot grid box here that you can
10:40
take notes in as you go through the
10:42
quarter so you might have a project to
10:44
you know write the rough draft of book
10:46
four in your series and you're going to
10:48
start it on January 1st you're going to
10:49
end it on February 20th so your
10:52
estimated time is fifty days to complete
10:55
it or 51 days to complete it over here
10:58
in the notes section you might say
11:00
actually took me 60 days here's why it
11:03
took so long here's how many days I
11:05
wrote per you know you
11:06
just take any kind of notes there that
11:08
you want to take so I have sheets like
11:10
that for goals one two and three now
11:13
what you do is you can take the project
11:17
planner which is where you write down a
11:19
project so say it was your project is to
11:21
write to the rough draft of book four in
11:23
your series you write down the start
11:25
date the end date your estimated time
11:27
and then there's a put place here to put
11:29
how much time it actually took you you
11:31
can describe the project and then here
11:33
you can write out all the tasks that go
11:34
into this particular project so this is
11:37
how we break down your goals versus your
11:39
projects versus your tasks so if your
11:41
project is to you know write a rough
11:44
draft of a book then your tasks might be
11:46
things like plot the book write out a
11:49
character sketch write the rough draft
11:52
of book one or if I mean write the rough
11:54
draft of Act one right out to write Act
11:56
three or you might even break it down to
11:59
if you knew there gonna be 50 chapters
12:00
or you knew you were aiming for fifty
12:03
thousand words your task could be you
12:05
know fifty thousand words broken down
12:08
into one thousand word tasks which I'll
12:10
explain more with the Kanban board but
12:12
you might want to say each task is a
12:14
thousand words but you can break that
12:15
down however you want and then if it was
12:17
like the next project was to actually
12:19
publish the book then your tasks might
12:21
be things like send your book to the
12:23
beta reader send your book to the editor
12:25
complete your your ownself edits send it
12:28
out to arc team or whatever so you've
12:30
got all these things that you can put on
12:31
your tasks now in the planner I only
12:34
provide those two project planner pages
12:36
but you may have like twenty projects
12:38
for the quarter so since this is a
12:40
printable planner you can just print
12:42
these pages twenty times if you have
12:44
twenty projects and some people won't
12:46
want to go and get this granule with
12:49
like writing it all out maybe you don't
12:50
want to write it out so you won't use
12:51
these pages it's really just here as a
12:53
tool for anyone who does want to use it
Kanban Board
12:55
then on this final page of the goal
12:57
settings section I have the explanation
13:00
of the Kanban board I will put a link up
13:03
on the screen that takes you back to how
13:04
I set up my Kanban board for ninety days
13:06
but this gives you an explanation of how
13:09
to set up your own Kanban board which on
13:11
the Kanban board you're going to put
13:12
your tasks and milestones and I talked a
13:14
little bit about milestones here so I
13:17
have all of these goal-setting pages
13:19
in this first section and I'm gonna
13:21
actually be starting to fill these out
13:22
for myself for q1 coming up in the next
13:25
week then in this next section I have
Q4 Planner
13:29
this is some stuff from my old like q4
13:33
planner and this is what goes in the
13:35
next page so actually in the planner at
13:37
this page is followed by this page where
13:39
you can set out your milestones for
13:41
January February and March so not only
13:43
do I have the 90 day plan but I kind of
13:45
know what things need to get done by the
13:47
end of January February and March and I
13:49
can mark them off as I go according to
13:51
goals 1 2 & 3 so just an extra tool for
13:54
you to use then I have this segment that
13:57
kind of explains how to use your planner
13:59
I've got an overview of 2019 with not
14:04
just the months but some lined section
14:08
underneath each month if you wanted to
14:09
write out like what your projects were
14:11
that you're tackling each month of the
14:12
year then I also have a calendar for
14:15
2020 where you can kind of sketch out
14:17
what you think you're going to be
14:18
working on next year and then after that
14:20
comes the months and in the actual
14:23
planner the months are not all together
14:25
like this this is just how I chose to
14:28
print it because I like to have my month
14:29
separate in the actual planner that
14:31
you'll get in the digital download it
14:34
would have January and then it would go
14:35
straight into the like weekly pages for
14:39
January and then February would come up
14:42
when that week comes up so it's just
14:44
kind of how you want to print it but
14:46
that's one of the cool things about
14:47
having a printable planners you can kind
14:49
of print it however you want but my
14:51
design for the monthlies is basically
14:53
just a basic month with notes section on
14:56
the side and I like to put so you'll see
14:58
with my December for example here's my
15:01
December monthly I'll put the different
15:03
projects that I'm working on this month
15:04
over here on the side and when they're
15:06
finished I will cross them off so I've
15:10
got the three months there that are
15:12
included in quarter one and then in the
Weekly Planner
15:16
next section I have my weekly setup so
15:20
I'm going to show you guys just quickly
15:22
kind of how the weeks are set up in this
15:24
particular planner and I personally do
15:27
not print out
15:30
everything like I don't print the entire
15:32
quarter because when you're dealing with
15:34
six ringbinder you just don't have
15:36
enough space to print all these pages so
15:38
I just print like a month at a time so
15:40
you can do it kind of however you want
15:41
but here's how the weekly layout is set
15:44
up first you kind of have a weekly
15:46
overview page where you have a section
15:49
for your tasks according to goal one
15:50
goal two and goal three so you can put
15:52
out your projects I like to write out
15:54
the actual tasks that I'm going to be
15:55
working on this week then there's a
15:58
section for other tasks like anything
16:00
else that needs to get done that's not
16:01
really on your 90-day plan then I have a
16:04
growth tracker which these are blank
16:06
because you might be tracking something
16:07
different from me I tracked my Facebook
16:10
page my coven my Instagram a YouTube and
16:12
my newsletter so at the beginning of the
16:14
week on Sunday I will write in what
16:16
numbers I have a follower so I have like
16:20
eleven thousand fifty six people who
16:23
liked my Facebook page and at the end of
16:25
the week on Sunday next week I'll put
16:27
the ending and then how many people I
16:29
added to my Facebook page this week then
16:33
I have a section for my work-in-progress
16:34
and if you are not a writer you know
16:38
this might not apply to you but you
16:39
could maybe kind of wipe this out and
16:41
use it for something else so I've got
16:43
that I'm working on fate surrender I'm
16:44
finishing up some plotting and I'll be
16:46
doing some writing and I usually have a
16:48
goal here of how much I wanted to write
16:49
but I wasn't sure since I'm also
16:51
launching the HP 90 bootcamp how much
16:54
time I would have for writing so I don't
16:55
really set a goal this week for my blog
16:59
I have a section to put what title what
17:01
keywords I'm using whether the post was
17:03
written if my images are done SEO
17:05
scheduled and shared and then I have a
17:07
section to write what are my absolute
17:08
top priorities for this week then
17:13
there's the weekly spread and on the
17:15
weekly spread it's basically a section
17:18
here on the left for your work in
17:20
progress any notes you want some habit
17:24
trackers over here the columns are
17:27
obviously I've decorated for my week but
17:30
the columns are just let me see if I
17:32
have a extra one for next week I don't
17:34
think I do I don't think I haven't
17:35
printed for next week but the columns
17:37
are just blank with dot grid and then
17:40
here at the bottom there's five little
17:42
check marks
17:43
that you could put your social media or
17:46
your like daily tasks or whatever it is
17:48
you wanted to do and you could write
17:49
your schedules out up here if you want
17:51
it and then there's a section here for
17:52
whatever promos you're running and then
17:56
there are daily pages so the daily pages
17:59
basically I can show you blank one of
18:01
those I believe you know I've put
18:05
something in all of them I've put
18:07
stickers on all of them but basically it
18:09
just has the date three lines here if
18:11
you wanted to put your three priorities
18:13
for the day it has the time from 6:00
18:15
a.m. to 10:00 p.m. so you can set your
18:17
schedule and then it's got three
18:18
basically blank boxes so you can use
18:21
them however you want I like to
18:23
personally use them for like here's what
18:27
I'm doing here's any like little things
18:31
that have like so here's my like to-do
18:33
list for the day my schedule for the day
18:35
and anything else I needed to remember
18:37
and then usually this box is for writing
18:39
sprints and obviously I didn't actually
18:41
do any so I don't have anything in that
18:42
box so this is a just kind of a weekly
18:47
and daily spread that you can use then
18:52
on sunday you've got sunday on the left
18:54
and on the right you kind of have a
18:55
weekly review the asks you questions
18:57
like what am I most proud of this week
18:59
what challenges did I face what do I do
19:01
next week to make it great am i on
19:03
target to hit my 90-day goals what do I
19:05
need to do to catch up or continue to
19:07
succeed and so on and then there's a
19:09
section here at the bottom to write out
19:11
what your expenses are what your sales
19:13
were and what your income was for this
19:15
week for this month or for this year and
19:17
again if you're not actively publishing
19:19
this might not apply to you so you might
19:21
just cover it with stickers or repurpose
19:22
it in another way but it's really good
19:26
for people who are working writers and
19:27
then when you turn the page you're back
19:29
to those tasks list and the weekly
19:30
review that you had now if you were to
19:34
download the planner if you don't feel
19:36
like you need a page for every day and
19:38
all you want to use is the weekly page
19:41
then another you get four downloads if
19:43
you purchase the planner you get the a5
19:45
that's the complete planner with all the
19:48
daily pages you get the letter size with
19:50
all the daily pages but then I also have
19:52
created an a5 size that doesn't have the
19:55
daily pages it just has the weekly
19:57
Agis so in the weekly version of the
19:59
planner you still get this task layout
20:02
where you write out all your tasks your
20:03
growth track or your blog post and
20:05
whatever you still get the weekly page
20:07
that has the whole week on two pages
20:10
that you can plan it in that way if you
20:12
want and then instead of the daily pages
20:15
what it has is it still has this weekend
20:17
review and then it just has a blank grid
20:19
page here so each week is just basically
20:22
three spreads you've got the overview
20:24
spread the weekly spread and then the
20:27
weekend review so it's got those three
20:29
pages for every week instead of all the
20:32
daily pages because especially if you're
20:33
using the big letter size some of you
20:36
might find that like a full page letter
20:38
size page for every day is too much
20:40
so you might just want to print the
20:42
weekly version so I give you all four of
20:43
those versions in the planner and that
20:46
is basically the entire HP 90 system
20:50
that walks you through it's over 40
20:51
pages of goal setting pages for you to
Bonus Pages
20:55
set your goals for the quarter and then
20:58
really follow through with your tasks
21:00
then some bonus pages in the very back
21:02
you have this writing plan which I've
21:04
got a video on how to fill this out as
21:06
well where you can kind of estimate how
21:08
many words you need to write what your
21:10
starting data is and your goals and then
21:12
a review and then on the back it has a
21:14
word count tracker that you can put your
21:17
sprints and so forth on these pages then
21:21
it also has some blank kind of notes
21:23
pages that you can print as many of
21:25
those as you want so it's just basic
21:27
note pages and then there's a blog post
21:32
brainstorm page that you can use to
21:34
brainstorm any of your blog posts that
21:36
you have coming up and there seems like
21:40
there might be one more page that I
21:41
added to it but I'm not exactly sure
21:43
these pages that have the little monthly
21:45
overview came from a different planner
21:47
not from my planner so I think that's
21:50
all that I have is the blog post
21:51
brainstorm the notes pages and the
21:53
writing plan with the sprints word count
21:55
tracker and that is my entire custom HP
21:58
90 planner if you are interested in
Outro
22:01
purchasing that the planner is $15 for
22:03
the q1 planner and it's available right
22:08
now and every quarter I'll have a new
22:09
one up
22:10
or if you are interested in the undated
22:12
version the undated version does not
22:14
have dates on it
22:15
it's still the same 90 day planner it
22:17
doesn't have the 2018 review because you
22:20
might be using it a different time of
22:22
the year so it just has the basic there
22:25
are pages for goal setting without the
22:27
review and it's undated so you can print
22:30
it every quarter over and over again
22:31
instead of buying a new one so those are
22:34
both available and the undated version
22:36
is $30 and again this is a printable
22:38
planner so you need to have a printer at
22:40
home or send out to a printer but just
22:43
be aware if you send it out it could get
22:44
kind of expensive especially if you do
22:46
it in color
22:47
the only color in the planner is
22:49
basically just some very light pink and
22:51
some of the words along the way are kind
22:53
of written in the screen not a lot of
22:55
color but a little bit so that is it you
22:57
guys thank you so much for watching this
23:00
video about my walkthrough of my custom
23:02

Planning For Writers
hey everybody Happy New Year and welcome
0:02
back to heart briefings I am so excited
0:04
about 2020 there's just something about
0:06
the balance of that to zero to zero and
0:10
the feeling of brand-new decade and so
0:13
many exciting things happening that just
0:15
has gotten me so excited for everything
0:16
that's coming up I am excited to be back
0:19
with videos I took a couple of weeks off
0:21
just for my own personal sanity because
0:24
I hadn't really taken much time off this
0:26
year even though I did have a baby so I
0:27
needed a couple of weeks and it was very
0:29
nice but now I am getting back into a
0:31
groove of my videos and getting
0:33
everything set up for the year including
0:35
my Kanban board which I will have a
0:37
reset video coming up later this week
0:39
but today what I'd like to show you is a
0:41
flip through of my custom HP 90 2020
0:45
goals planner so this is a little bit
0:47
different from my q1 planner it's the
0:49
same goal setting pages but instead of
0:51
having the weekly and daily pages and it
0:54
just being for the quarter this includes
0:56
the entire years worth of goal-setting
0:58
pages so I'll walk you through exactly
1:00
what that means and the difference
1:02
between the two planners and all of that
1:04
in this video so if you're really
1:05
interested in a great goal-setting
1:08
planner and you didn't want to get the
1:10
q1 planner or the quarterly planner
1:13
because you didn't need those weekly and
1:14
daily pages this is a really great
1:16
planner for you if you're really looking
1:18
to set yourself up for success in 2020
1:20
so I hope you'll take a look at it later
1:22

1:24
reset of my Kanban board I'm also a
1:26
little bit late posting the HP notebook
1:29
challenge so make sure you look out for
1:31
that later this week I am gonna be
1:33

1:35
is an exclusive from the seasonal
1:37
surprise box so you can't get this
1:39

1:41
this away with some notebooks inside so
1:43

1:45
that you have your notifications on so
1:47

1:49
guys let's get into it here's a look at
1:51
my custom 20 28 goals planner hey
1:53
everybody I'm just going to take a
1:55
minute to walk you through my custom
1:58
goals planner for this year so I've
2:00
shown you guys the HP 90 quarterly
2:02
planner which is basically a goal
2:05
setting system that has 50 or so pages
2:09
that are how to set your goals how to
2:12
set up your
2:12
on board how to break your goals down
2:14
into projects and tasks so it's a very
2:16
specific powerful goal-setting system
2:19
that I love I've been using for a couple
2:20
of years I developed this kind of over
2:22
the course of several years to help
2:24
myself hit my own goals and now I've
2:27
been teaching other people how to do it
2:29
in the HP 90 bootcamp course but if you
2:31
are not interested or not ready to jump
2:33
into the course yet you could try out
2:35
this HP 90 quarterly planner now the
2:38
quarterly planner has all of the
2:41
goal-setting system in the front and
2:42
then what it has is basically a weekly
2:46
system so I've shown this before so I'm
2:49
not going to go too deep into it but so
2:51
basically the weekly and daily like
2:54
planner part of the HP 90 quarterly
2:56
planner has an overview for your tasks
2:59
so it's lists out your three goals and
3:01
then you can put what tasks you're doing
3:03
this week so if you're writing was your
3:07
first goal then you would put like what
3:08
writing tasks you were doing this week
3:10
and so on then over here you can put
3:12
your work in progress now if you're not
3:14
a writer I do have a lot of people that
3:16
use this that aren't writers you could
3:19
put something else here instead of work
3:20
in progress you could put like what your
3:22
main project is or what your main focus
3:24
is for the week then I changed up the
3:26
layout some this year to take away the
3:29
growth tracker and stuff because a lot
3:31
of people weren't using that and instead
3:33
it's just a giant notes section and all
3:35
of this is doc grid even though it
3:38
doesn't show up super well in video
3:39
sorry if you can hear the baby she's
3:41
with my husband upstanders and she's
3:43
just kind of being a little bit loud so
3:45
please forgive that then you've got a
3:48
weekly spread so again I changed this up
3:52
a little bit this year so now if got a
3:54
bigger work-in-progress section a note
3:56
section in the habit tracker for five
3:58
habits and then you just have one long
4:01
column for each of the seven days and
4:04
these are also have a doc grid pattern
4:07
in them so that you can keep track of
4:10
basically everything you're doing and
4:11
the way that I use this is I write down
4:14
which tasks I plan to do then I schedule
4:18
out those tasks for like this would be
4:20
ideally how I would get them all done
4:22
this week then it moves on to a daily
4:25
spread that
4:26
has three lines at the top where you
4:27
could put like your three most you know
4:29
strongest priorities then you've got
4:31
several like empty boxes that you can
4:33
arrange and use them however you would
4:35
like so over here on this side though
4:38
you have time from 6:00 a.m. to 10:00
4:40
p.m. that you could write out your
4:42
schedules and that's one of the things I
4:43
love about this layout is it's really
4:45
flexible in terms of you can use it one
4:47
way or change it you could put a sticker
4:49
here lots of different things you can do
4:51
so basically that is the majority of the
4:55
HP 90 quarterly plan and it just goes
4:57
per quarter so the q1 only goes from
5:00
January 1st to March 31st and it has all
5:03
of the goal-setting pages in the front
5:05
and then it has the weekly and daily
5:07
pages for the rest of all the way
5:10
through March
5:10
there are also monthly reviews this is
5:13
something new I added to the quarterly
5:15
planner
5:15
so there's monthly reviews where it's
5:17
like what did you accomplish this month
5:19
how can you you know do better next
5:21
month and that sort of thing then I
5:23
don't have everything printed because I
5:25
only keep one month printed in my
5:26
planner at a time but there's a monthly
5:28
review for every month and actually
5:29
there's also a review page for the end
5:33
of every week so you've got weekly
5:34
monthly and you have a quarterly review
5:37
that's expanded now that's like a four
5:38
page spread of quarterly review
5:40
questions it'll help you plan for the
5:42
next quarter so that is the q1 like HB
5:45
90 planner I put a new one out every
5:48
single quarter there's also an undated
5:49
one the advantage of the dated one is
5:52
that you get different quotes pages so
5:54
there's these pretty quote pages
5:56
throughout the planner
5:57
you also get kind of a different little
5:58
pep talk and walk through at the
6:00
beginning of the goal-setting pages and
6:02
of course all the dates are written in
6:04
for you in the undated you know
6:07
obviously you'll be printing it with the
6:08
same quotes pages and you'll be writing
6:11
in your own dates
6:12
but that planner that both of those
6:14
planners the undated and the q1 come in
6:17
a5 size which is what I've got in this
6:19
carpe diem planner and they also come in
6:22
letter size which is what I have in this
6:24
happy planner but for this year for 2020
6:27
I actually just released a new planner
6:30
which is the goals planner so this
6:33
planner is basically the goal-setting
6:36
pages that I was talking about that are
6:38
at the front of that
6:39
one planner or the quarterly planner
6:41
it's the goal setting pages for the
6:43
entire year but what it doesn't have is
6:45
those weekly and daily spreads so this
6:48
one is more of just the goal-setting
6:50
workbook in a way and it's not a daily
6:52
planner so you wouldn't be able to like
6:55
schedule your days and you know have
6:57
those like task lists and stuff like
6:59
that that you have in the other planner
7:01
but I know many of you were curious
7:03
about this and whether or not you wanted
7:05
to get the goals planner so I'm a little
7:07
bit late getting this video up but I did
7:09
want to walk you through it now what I'm
7:11
planning to do is I've printed out the
7:14
entire goals planner now this is almost
7:16
a 300 page planner so it's quite beefy
7:19
so if you send it out to be printed and
7:22
you get it in color just go ahead and
7:24
definitely make sure that you get it
7:26
double-sided instead of single page and
7:28
then go ahead and get a quote because it
7:30
could be quite expensive to have it
7:32
printed elsewhere or what you might want
7:34
to do is just have it printed in black
7:36
and white instead of with the color
7:38
because that'll make it a lot less
7:39
expensive now you can get it printed in
7:42
letter which is just a basic letter size
7:44
or you can actually if you send it out
7:46
to be printed you can print it in a5
7:48
size at a printer and have them cut it
7:51
you know to a5 size for you when it
7:53
comes to the a5 for my planner I cut the
7:57
page like I take this same paper and I
7:59
cut it down to a five size and then I
8:02
print on it but it's gonna depend on
8:04
what kind of printer you have so you
8:06
might want to do some googling about how
8:07
to print on a5 before you commit to it
8:09
but letter size is super easy to print
8:11
on so you get both sizes included in the
8:14
planner so yeah here comes the goal
8:16
planner I worked so hard on this I hope
8:19
that you guys love it
8:20
please let me know how it's working for
8:22
you if you're using it but this is the
8:24
2020 goals planner and I'm gonna quickly
8:26
just kind of flip through it so at the
8:29
front you have overview of 2020 with a
8:32
little bit of notes section so if you
8:33
wanted to plan out your release schedule
8:36
or your work schedule or anything like
8:38
that on here then you also have an
8:39
overview of 2021 this is in the
8:41
quarterly planner every time as well
8:44
then you have your quarterly sections so
8:47
the q1 section with a quote and then
8:50
every single quarter the quote changes a
8:52
little bit
8:55
then what you have is basically what is
8:58
also in the beginning of the q1 planner
9:00
the quote is the same all of this like
9:03
verbage is the same so this is basically
9:06
like a little pep talk and a walkthrough
9:07
of how to use the planner and how to you
9:10
know set up your goals and things like
9:11
that so all of this first part of q1 is
9:14
the exact same as in the quarterly
9:15
planner so you've got your vision
9:18
statement which is something that I only
9:20
include in this goals planner for q1
9:23
because hopefully you're setting up your
9:25
vision for the entire year or for your
9:27
your life really so you've got a few
9:29
questions to sort of solidify your
9:31
vision you've got a section here that
9:32
says your ideal day and again this is
9:34
all dot grid even though I know it
9:36
doesn't show up great in the video it
9:38
will show up when you print it then you
9:40
have a two-page spread where you can do
9:42
your vision board
9:43
now in my HB 90 course a lot of people
9:45
will do their vision boards in canva or
9:47
on Pinterest and then print them out I
9:49
am actually a fan of doing mine on paper
9:52
because I like to have it somewhere that
9:55
I can either have it in my planner or up
9:57
on the wall so often I'll do them on a
9:59
big sheet of poster board instead of in
10:01
the planner but there is space for you
10:03
to do it in the planner then what you
10:05
have that's different from the q1
10:07
planner here is you have your q1 plan
10:11
checklist so this doesn't exist in the
10:13
quarterly plan because you don't have
10:15
all four quarters but this is just a
10:18
checklist for all the different pages
10:20
that you need to fill out in your you
10:23
know quarterly planning so it just has
10:25
like created my vision board
10:26
brainstormed my list prioritized my list
10:29
you know set up my Kanban board and then
10:31
as you complete it you can checklist it
10:33
and then if there's anything else you
10:34
wanted to add to it I've left some space
10:36
here for you to add your own like to
10:38
dues to your checklist let's have some
10:41
fun
10:42
and now you go into again this is in the
10:44
quarterly planner but this is the actual
10:46
goal setting pages so the first part was
10:48
like your vision this is what you need
10:51
to do to set up your plan so you've got
10:54
the same pages some decluttering lists
10:56
which is kind of dumping everything out
10:58
of your brain
10:59
then set section where it teaches you
11:02
how to prioritize everything that was on
11:04
those lists and start
11:05
to see some examples and things of how
11:08
to set your goals for the quarter so
11:12
then you can see there's there's quote
11:13
pages throughout then the next thing you
11:16
do after you've kind of prioritize is
11:17
you do what I call the time estimator
11:19
where you take the three months of the
11:22
first quarter you block off all the days
11:24
you know you're not going to be working
11:25
and figure out how many days you
11:27
actually have to work towards your goals
11:28
for the quarter then you've got a list
11:31
place to list your like ongoing habits
11:34
and routine type tasks or your admin
11:36
tasks a place to set up your ideal
11:38
weekly schedule then comes the goal
11:42
setting pages so in the beginning in the
11:44
Q one section of the goal planner there
11:47
is a walk through of how to use all of
11:49
these pages so you've got a sheet that
11:50
says like set your goals and it tells
11:52
you how to do this like I said this is
11:54
also in the quarterly planner now what
11:56
will change is in this goal-setting
11:58
planner as you get into q2 q3 q4 is
12:01
these explanation sheets aren't there
12:04
anymore because you don't really need
12:05
them over and over again you can always
12:07
reference this at the beginning so this
12:09
kind of explains to you how to set your
12:11
goals then you get a chance to
12:13
brainstorm what your goals might be and
12:15
then finally you set your three goals
12:17
now you can have just one goal or you
12:19
can have two goals you can also have
12:21
maybe three work goals and a personal
12:23
goal but I prefer to only set a max of
12:26
three goals for your business or for
12:28
your work because anything more than
12:32
that starts to be too much to really
12:33
like focus then you've got a future
12:36
projects section here which my business
12:39
mentor amber McHugh calls a future idea
12:41
parking lot or the million-dollar
12:42
parking lot so this is where you can say
12:45
well the you know I don't have time to
12:47
do this project in q1 but I really want
12:50
to do it in q2 so I'm going to write it
12:52
down for the possibility of where I
12:53
might do it so you could put okay I want
12:56
to actually I'm going to write my book
12:57
in q1 but I'm actually going to edit it
12:59
in q2 and publish it in q3 so you could
13:01
put those kind of things so you kind of
13:03
have an idea of what you're gonna do in
13:05
the future
13:05
then this explains how to break down
13:08
your projects and tasks so you have a
13:11
place to say like here was my goal
13:13
here's the projects I think are going to
13:14
help me get to that goal and this still
13:16
is all just brainstorming and I give you
13:19
sheep for each goal and then a bonus
13:21
sheet in case you had some overflow then
13:24
what you're going to do is actually
13:25
schedule out your project so for example
13:27
you might say goal number one is to
13:29
write and publish new books in order to
13:31
make $10,000 a month so then you would
13:34
say project two number one is to write
13:36
the rough draft of book ten in my series
13:38
I'm going to start it on this date end
13:39
it on this day and I'm estimating that
13:41
it's going to take me you know 75 days
13:43
to complete and you would write out all
13:45
your projects that go to towards helping
13:48
you achieve that goal and I have that
13:51
same spread for goal number two and goal
13:53
number three so here's where you're
13:54
actually deciding exactly which projects
13:56
and scheduling them out then you have a
13:59
project planner where you say okay let's
14:02
say that first project was to write the
14:04
rough draft of book ten in my series I
14:06
would again write the start date the end
14:07
date the estimated time and then once
14:09
that project was complete I would write
14:11
out the actual time it took me to finish
14:14
it that way I know later when I go back
14:16
to estimate how long it will take me to
14:18
write a rough draft I have proof here
14:20
that okay I thought it was gonna take me
14:21
seventy-five days but it actually took
14:23
me a hundred and five days so I know I
14:25
underestimate it or whatever then you
14:27
break that project down into all the
14:29
tiny little tasks so you could break it
14:31
down into like 500 words apiece or like
14:33
write Act one or you need to plot you
14:36
need to finish your character sheets you
14:37
know whatever tasks go into finishing
14:40
that rough draft can get written here
14:42
and then you've got a note section and
14:44
then you can write down like what goal
14:47
that is attached to moves me toward my
14:49
goal to write and publish in order to
14:52
make $10,000 a month so you only have
14:54
two project planner sheets per quarter
14:57
but since it's a principle you can print
15:00
out as many of those as you want or you
15:01
can just write them on your notes
15:03
sections then you've got a explanation
15:09
of how to set up your Kanban board and
15:11
how to fill out this milestone sheet so
15:13
that you know which of your projects you
15:15
plan to have done by January by the end
15:18
of February and then by the end of March
15:19
so that sets up your kind of 30 60 90
15:22
day milestones then this explains to you
15:26
how to use your monthly planner pages
15:28
sorry if you can hear the baby crying in
15:30
the background then you've got the
15:32
actual
15:33
part of the planner that's in the
15:35
goal-setting planner and like I said you
15:36
don't have the weekly and daily task
15:39
pages but here's what you do have so you
15:41
have a monthly overview with a notes
15:43
page and in this version of the planner
15:46
I actually tell you in the monthly
15:48
planner what week it is so this is week
15:51
one of the quarter week two week three
15:52
week four and so on then after the month
15:56
it moves on into the weeks so week one
15:58
technically December 30th - January 5th
16:01
and here similar to what you had in that
16:03
weekly spread this is what I call a
16:05
weekly checklist so instead of any type
16:07
of like actual planner like weekly
16:09
spreads you get this weekly checklist
16:11
for every week in the year so you would
16:14
say this is attached to goal number one
16:16
and the task is that I'm going to plot
16:18
Act one of the book this is attached to
16:21
goal number two and I'm going to setup
16:23
my newsletter list you know whatever it
16:25
is so you would write out which goal it
16:27
is one two or three over here the tasks
16:29
that you're doing over here and then
16:31
once it's completed you can check it off
16:33
so you have one for week one week two of
16:35
the quarter week three week four week
16:39
five another kind of quote page then
16:42
you've got your end of January review
16:44
which is a two-page spread then you have
16:46
your February monthly calendar and we're
16:49
back to the weekly checklist week six
16:51
seven eight and nine of the quarter then
16:54
you've got your February review then
16:57
you've got your March week which is the
16:59
final week in the quarter so you've got
17:02
the monthly spread weeks ten eleven
17:05
twelve and thirteen at the bottom of
17:08
week eleven you've got a task already
17:10
added for you because I think it's best
17:12
to go between weeks eleven and twelve to
17:15
plan out your quarterly review so I have
17:17
complete my quarterly review and start
17:19
planning for next quarter I like to
17:21
start doing that when there's still two
17:22
weeks left in the quarter so then you've
17:24
got week eleven and twelve and then at
17:26
the back of that you have that actual
17:28
four-page quarterly review so hopefully
17:31
you can see how this is similar to the
17:34
quarterly like hb9 dq1 planner you've
17:37
got the same reviews you've got the same
17:39
monthly spreads the same goal-setting
17:41
pages but instead of having those weekly
17:44
and daily spreads you just have a weekly
17:46
checklist
17:46
and that's the main difference and of
17:48
course that the quarterly planner is
17:50
just one quarter at a time just ninety
17:53
days and this 2020 goal-setting planner
17:56
has the entire year so then you've got
17:58
just a two-page notes spread if you want
18:00
to start journaling or making notes
18:02
about what you're going to do next
18:03
quarter or how this quarter went and
18:05
then boom now we have q2 of 2020 so now
18:09
it will take you through that exact same
18:10
process for q2 it still has a quotes
18:13
page and a little pep talk from me but
18:16
instead of having all of those
18:17
explanations about how to use your
18:19
vision board how to prioritize your list
18:21
it is literally just the pages of the
18:24
workbook and the explanations are no
18:26
longer there so you've got your q2
18:28
planned checklist and then you've got
18:30
all the pages you need to make your plan
18:32
and if you need to go back to reference
18:36
those sheets that kind of explain to you
18:39
how to set your goals or how to
18:41
brainstorm and that sort of thing you've
18:43
got them at the beginning like the
18:45
prioritize and all of those other
18:47
explanations you've got them at the
18:49
beginning to reference so it walks you
18:51
through setting those goals all over
18:53
again
18:53
you've got your project planners your
18:55
milestones and then you're out to your
18:58
q2 monthly spread and your q2 weekly
19:02
checklist so you've basically got that
19:03
all the way through the entire year so
19:07
once you get through the end of June now
19:11
you go to your q3 planner and then once
19:17
you get through the end of September
19:21
you've got your q4 planner so you
19:23
basically could just print out one
19:25
quarter at a time and incorporate it
19:28
into your existing like happy planner or
19:30
something like that like if it comes
19:32
with the letter and the a5 sizes but if
19:35
you wanted to print it and put it into
19:37
just a regular like classic size happy
19:39
planner you would print it at 84%
19:41
instead of a hundred percent you would
19:43
print the letter at eighty four percent
19:44
and then you'd have to cut the pages
19:46
down but you can make it work for a
19:49
regular happy planner you could also use
19:50
a three-ring binder or anything like
19:52
that and I would definitely recommend
19:53
doing this if you wanted to put it in a
19:56
half letter binder like one of those
19:58
smaller binders you would just take the
19:59
letter and
20:00
printed at 50% and then cut the pages
20:03
now you could print it at 50% and print
20:05
two pages per page just make sure that
20:08
you do some practicing so that you
20:10
understand you know what you need to
20:12
have on the front and back if you want
20:13
to do it double-sided so basically that
20:16
is a walk through of the goals planner
20:18
so hopefully you can see how it's a
20:20
little bit different now at the very end
20:22
of the goals planner once you get to the
20:28
end where you have like week 12 and 13
20:31
and then I give you a task list for week
20:32
1 of 20 21 because there's still a few
20:35
days of December there you've got
20:36
another quotes page then you've got a
20:38
letter from me about how to plan for
20:41
next year another notes page and then
20:44
you have a twenty twenty yearly review
20:47
so this is really powerful I did this
20:51
similar type of review to this with my
20:53
HB 90 alumni and it was really really
20:56
helpful I think not only for me but
20:58
hopefully really helpful for them if you
21:00
were in that group and you enjoyed it go
21:03
ahead and comment down below and let us
21:05
know what you thought of the review but
21:06
this is a much longer review where
21:09
you've got several pages and it goes
21:10
much deeper into how did the year go
21:13
what went right what went wrong and how
21:15
can I improve for next year so you've
21:17
got a lot of questions for helping you
21:19
plan for next year then you've got a
21:22
free write exercise where you can say
21:24
what really did work what didn't work
21:25
and then finally what's going to work
21:28
out better for you next year what do you
21:30
need to have done by the end of 2021 in
21:32
order to say that it was a success and
21:34
then one of the final pages here is your
21:36
2021 list wish list which is a list of
21:39
the top ten things you want to get done
21:40
next year so this goals planner is
21:43
really a great way to set yourself up
21:45
for you know really planning your goals
21:48
on a quarterly system and you know
21:51
having those weekly task lists having
21:53
all of those like quarterly monthly
21:55
reviews the yearly review to help you
21:57
plan and really achieve your goals and
21:59
this is a good option for those of you
22:02
who have kind of been wanting to use the
22:05
HB 90 planner but don't really need like
22:08
the daily or weekly pages this will give
22:10
you just the goal-setting system without
22:12
the daily and week
22:14
so let's say you're already using like
22:16
an Erin Condren or a plum and paper
22:18
planner or panda planner that's like
22:20
your normal everyday type planner this
22:22
is just a supplement to that so you
22:25
might not need what I've got what I use
22:28
which is these like daily pages you
22:30
might not need something like that but
22:32
you might still want to use the
22:33
quarterly system so that would make the
22:36
goals planner perfect for you so just in
22:39
a nutshell again to kind of explain it
22:41
the HP 90 quarterly planner so like the
22:44
q1 2020 planner is just for 90 days it
22:48
has the goal-setting pages and then it
22:51
has a weekly and daily spreads so it
22:53
works as like your actual daily weekly
22:56
planner then the goal-setting planner
23:00
has those same reviews and quarterly
23:03
goal-setting pages but instead of only
23:06
carrying you through a quarter at a time
23:07
it carries you through the entire year
23:09
of 2020 but it doesn't have the weekly
23:12
and daily spreads if you have any
23:14
questions about how to use it or what
23:16
would be the right one for you please
23:19
let me know go ahead and comment down
23:20
below so these planners are all
23:22
available on Etsy you've got the q1
23:24
dated planner for 2020 that carries you
23:27
through the end of March you have the
23:29
undated quarterly planner which has the
23:31
weekly and daily pages that carries you
23:33
through an entire quarter and you can
23:35
just reprint that over and over again
23:37
for every quarter or you've got the 2020
23:40
goals planner which carries you through
23:42
the whole year with just the goal
23:44
setting pages so hopefully that explains
23:45
that I know many of you are also waiting
23:47
on my social media planner which I have
23:51
actually been working on a little bit
23:52
since the Christmas holidays but I tried
23:55
to explain in one of my previous videos
23:56
that is just one of those things that
23:58
didn't get done I got a little bit sick
24:00
towards the end of my quarter and just
24:03
didn't have time or energy to finish the
24:06
social media planner so a little bit
24:08
delayed not ideal but sometimes we just
24:11
can't meet every single goal that we
24:13
have for the quarter so please be
24:15
patient I am working on it and hope to
24:16
have it up in the next week or two I
24:18
will do another walkthrough at that
24:19
point for the social media planner to
24:21
give you a little bit of a sneak peak of
24:23
it though if you're interested I do have
24:25
some
24:25
the pages already printed out in my
24:28
planner because I plan to use them as
24:29
sort of a test so you've got a social
24:32
media overview where you can track your
24:34
followers on five different platforms so
24:36
you would mark at the beginning of
24:38
January how many followers you have and
24:40
how many followers you added or the
24:41
growth throughout that month then you
24:44
can see this is why I'm testing it
24:46
there's like something overlapped and it
24:48
didn't print a line so you've got a
24:49
questionnaire about your social media
24:51
strategy blog post planner and a blog
24:55
post topics list there's also a video
24:57
topics list if you're on YouTube hashtag
24:59
tracker then I've got like a monthly
25:02
social media overview where you can also
25:04
do like an editorial calendar and this
25:07
is where I now have my growth tracker so
25:10
you could say like the Facebook page how
25:12
many followers I had at the beginning
25:14
how many I had at the end and how many I
25:16
was hoping to add versus how many I
25:18
actually added so that's really cool you
25:21
can also mark any like events or promos
25:23
that you have going on for the month and
25:24
when they're happening and then any
25:26
other hashtags or notes that you're
25:28
using throughout the month so like if
25:30
you were doing you know like in a hash
25:32
tag indie book reads challenge on
25:34
Instagram you could mark that down here
25:36
then this is the weekly spread for the
25:39
social media calendar and right now I'm
25:42
doing it as an undated planner I don't
25:44
know if I'm going to leave it like that
25:45
or not because the problem with doing it
25:47
undated in this way is that it can be a
25:51
little bit trickier for people to print
25:53
out the way that I have it now so some
25:56
decisions still to be made but basically
25:58
you would say here like what's the
26:00
platform so this would be your Facebook
26:02
page or your Instagram you would mark
26:04
how many followers you had at the
26:05
beginning of the week and then every day
26:07
you would say what you're planning to
26:09
post so you can have like a list of the
26:11
type of images or the type of topic that
26:14
you want or let's say you were doing a
26:16
hashtag challenge you could write like
26:18
what today you're supposed to talk about
26:20
your work in progress or your character
26:21
or the favorite book you read when you
26:23
were little so you could mark all of
26:24
those prompts here and then at the end
26:26
of the week you have a place to mark
26:28
your weekly growth where you could say
26:29
like Plus 130 new followers then you've
26:33
got notes down at the bottom for any
26:35
promotions or events that are going on
26:37
this week and I've got that
26:38
print it out for every day and then
26:41
again you've got another social media
26:43
overview there are other pages that I'm
26:46
adding to this that I just didn't print
26:48
out that will be like an interaction
26:51
like you can see how many likes or
26:54
comments you can track how many likes or
26:55
comments you got on each post and that
26:57
sort of thing so there's going to be a
26:59
lot more to the social media overview or
27:02
the social media planner there's also
27:03
going to be an explanation of what
27:05
content buckets are as well as some
27:08
ideas for what to post on social media
27:10
if you're an author and then what I'm
27:13
hoping to have before the end of this
27:15
quarter is a sort of like a miniature
27:17
course it won't be a long course and it
27:19
won't be an expensive course it'll just
27:20
be kind of a short course to explain
27:24
sort of how to use the planner and how
27:26
to plan your social media if you're an
27:27
author or an entrepreneur and so it will
27:30
have a lot of good information on how to
27:32
decide what to post and how to use this
27:35
planner why you want to track these
27:36
things and stuff like that so hopefully
27:38
that course will go up before the end of
27:41
this quarter but we'll see if I end up
27:42
having time for it so that is just a
27:47
quick overview of the social media
27:48
planner but I will do a full walkthrough
27:50
of it
27:51
when we get a little bit closer to it
27:54
finally being done which hopefully won't
27:55
be long so alright guys I hope you
27:57
enjoyed this
27:58
you can grab all of these planners over
28:00
on my Etsy shop they are all right now
28:02
principal planners even though it is
28:04
hopefully on my dream list for this year
28:06
to have a actual printed version of
28:08
these planners for 2021 so I have
28:11
fingers crossed on that I hope that you
28:13
enjoyed this and if you decide to use it
28:15
please let me know how it's going that's
28:16
it for now guys thank you so much I hope

Planning For Writers

hey guys welcome to heart breathing's I am so excited to share with you how I outline my novels now this is not going
0:07
to be a step-by-step of how I plot my novels I've been through that before so if you're looking for that kind of
0:12
information of how I actually dive in and plot my novels and figure out what comes next and what the plot points are
0:18
then I will link for you down below my how to plot your novel series that I did here on YouTube there's also a great one
0:25
that I did on how to edit my novel which might be helpful for you after NaNoWriMo if you are participating in nano but
0:31
what I've got for you today is a little bit more of an inside look at exactly how I gather my materials what materials
0:38
I use when I'm plotting and when I'm outlining my novel how I actually go about the process of doing it and then
0:45
when I kind of know that I'm ready so if you're looking more for that like what materials and how I go through the
0:50
process then you were in the right place so stay tuned okay so before I get into
0:59
the rest of the video which is all the top-down stuff and I know this is going to be a long one but I hope that you
1:04
guys find it useful before I get into all that I am gonna give just a little bit of a caveat here I am obviously if
1:12
you're new to my channel you'll just be learning this if you've been with me for a while then you know this to be true and you can kind of tell from the
1:18
craziness behind me I am someone who likes to organize everything
1:23
color-coded lots of materials lots of stationery it not only inspires me but
1:29
it helps me stay organized with my thoughts it helps me see things at a glance and know this is the color that
1:34
goes with this point of view and I also write a lot of multiple POV novels so my
1:40
main shadow demon saga is four different points of view my eternal sorrow series which I'll be working on today I'm gonna
1:47
be realigning that book coming up for Nano so that has eight points of view so
1:52
if you're just writing a single POV you don't need all these colors and all this other stuff but I just wanted to give you some examples and a real look at
1:59
what I do maybe it'll give you some ideas of what you can do if you have multiple POVs or
2:04
if you want to sort of organize your books a little bit better when you're outlining so I know that
2:11
this is necessary it's not like having five different or eight different colors of note cards or a certain kind of pin
2:16
is going to make your book better but for me writing is something that I tend
2:21
to procrastinate on a lot even though I love to do it there's that fear even after 25 novels that I go oh my gosh you
2:29
know what if it's not going to come out the way I want it to or oh my there's some laundry to get done or I've got to clean this up or whatever so it's
2:35
something I still have resistance on and something that helps me overcome that resistance is diving in with materials
2:42
that I like to use like the note cards the sticky notes the stickers the pen but I'm not saying in any way that you
2:48
have to use this stuff to be a successful novelist you could literally just have a notebook and a pen that you
2:55
got from somebody's dentist's office it does not matter what's really important is what's going on up in your brain and
3:01
figuring out your own process it took me a while to figure out this process for
3:06
myself but it's something almost like a ritual for me that when I get the note cards together the colors chosen I get
3:14
my notebook set up just right it begins to trigger a lot of thoughts in my brain about what's happening in the story and
3:20
so it's just a way to sort of ease myself physically into this mental space
3:25
where I can perform better as a thinker as a writer as a creator and then once
3:32
I've got all this stuff set up it's like I know and I get excited and I say okay this is the time to plot this novel and
3:39
to get involved in it and I have to tell you I just got chills just thinking about it which I know sounds so crazy but it's just that feeling of like this
3:47
is the excitement if I don't go through that process if I'm rushing and I don't follow this process of like getting my
3:53
material set up and getting myself excited then the story doesn't come and I try to take walks and I try to do
3:59
other things that I try to like force that try to sit down and just make myself write it and it never works and what I've realized is that for me this
4:06
sort of ritual of getting all my materials together and outlining in such a way is crucial to getting myself in
4:12
the mental space so if you've been hesitant to write or you've been resisting it or you've been
4:18
procrastinating which a lot of us do try coming up with a ritual like this but
4:24
this will be fun for you to see and it's a longer video so grab your coffee and settle down and hopefully you'll enjoy
4:29
this and if you are participating in NaNoWriMo and you decide to do something similar than tag me and on Instagram and
4:36
let me know kind of how you're outlining is going I had said that I was going to be working on book 11 of my shadow demon
4:42
saga but I didn't finish this book because the plot was getting wonky so I did exactly what I was just talking
4:47
about instead of trying to rush it so that I could start a new book for Nano I decided to take my time go back through
4:53
my trusty process that I know works for me and I'm going to reap lot this book that it's already about thirty to forty
5:00
thousand more it's finished so I'm going to reap lot it rethink it make sure it's in a good place and I'm gonna get myself
5:05
excited to start rewriting it or finishing it up during nano this year so
5:10
let's get started okay so here is my process when I'm first starting a book
5:16
so I will gather all the materials that I need to get started and first of all I
5:21
do have a set of index cards that have some basic reminders of the different
5:28
plot points so I will link for you down below and hopefully up here in the cards somewhere on the screen my how to plot a
5:34
novel series and this may not be the way everybody plots their novel but this is the way that I found by reading a bunch
5:40
of different books and kind of pulling from my favorite resources so when I'm actually sitting down to plot I will
5:46
pull out index cards that I've written just some little reminders of what each
5:52
of these plot points is about but the ones that I have are a little bit older because they don't include
5:58
some of the newer books that I found like kmy Lin's structuring your novel that were amazing so what I've been
6:05
working on the last couple days is creating a new set of sort of cheat sheet cards so they're not completely
6:11
finished but for example Act one the hook which is kind of like James Scott bell calls the disturbance or the
6:17
opening image so this says like the opening question you want the reader to ask so that they're asking what's going
6:22
to happen so that's just like a little cheat sheet about the hook and so on so I have cards here for each of the points
6:28
in my plotting process and this doesn't actually have the plot of this novel
6:34
these are ones that I can use over and over again so when I start plotting and make sure that I have these cheat sheet
6:39
cards these are things that I know but sometimes like reading it again will spur a new thought so I have my index
6:45
cards that's the first thing then I also pull out a set of index cards that match
6:51
the points of view that I'm going to be talking about so or that I'm going to be using a novel sometimes it's just a
6:57
single POV so I've used a single color or maybe white but with this book it was a challenge because usually you can only
7:03
find like maybe four or five different colors of index cards if you go to Staples but I couldn't find eight different colors that also match
7:09
stickers that I'll show you in a minute so I ended up cutting my own note cards out of card stock paper that I just
7:15
bought at Michaels so I've got my eight points of view I have green pink blue black red purple a lighter color of
7:24
green and yellow so I've got these different note cards and you can see I only have a few of the black ones
7:30
because that's for a POV that doesn't appear very often but I just cut these out myself with a paper cutter so I made
7:36
sure I have whatever note cards I'm going to be using for the POVs are ready to go as well I will usually have
7:42
scissors because I might need that for cutting washi tape I get some of my favorite pins now this is just a pen
7:48
that I've been using a lot lately the pilot precise b5 retractable or arty it's a very fine point and I super love
7:55
the spin so I'd be using that then I will gather any kind of stickers that I
8:00
want to use this is obviously completely optional you don't have to use any of this stuff I just find that if I can
8:07
sort of sticker up my plotting notes and my brainstorm notes then it just makes me happier and happier I am doing
8:15
something the more likely I am to follow through with it so it's just a little trick that I use so this is a big book
8:20
of happy planner stickers that I can use when I'm going through my brainstorming
8:25
note so I'll show you that so I usually grab gather any stickers I want to use then I also have a lot of stuff that I
8:31
put into this Erin Condren tote so I've got as you can see washi tape now this
8:37
is kind of glittery washi tape because hey it's nano this time and I'm going all out it's also the end of a series
8:42
that I've been writing for more than a decade so I am going to go all out with
8:48
it so I've got all those different kind of colors and there's eight of them
8:53
in the same colors basically as I have the note cards except that I couldn't
8:59
find yellow so I'm going with gold for that one and then I also have the same eight colors in skinny washy because I
9:05
used the skinny washy in a different way so I've got washi tapes that match the colors of my note cards and like I said
9:11
this is definitely extra and not necessary but I wanted to show you guys how I do it then I have these stickers
9:17
are ones that are called teacher creative resources on Amazon and they're really for like chore charts or whatever
9:24
you know behavior charts in the classroom but I found them and they happen to have eight different colors on
9:30
them so I bought a ton of these so that I can use them in different plotting but that's how I chose the colors for my
9:35
note cards so that's where that color system came from and why I'm using two greens for example so that I could use
9:41
these stickers to mark different scenes for POV so I'll show you how I use that in a minute so washi tape index cards stickers then
9:49
the next step is all the pins that I use to help me color code so this is a little bit crazy I realized but I've got
9:57
a ton of tombow dual brush pens and this you can color code with basically any type of pin or marker like I also have a
10:04
bunch of Crayola super tips for example these are super cheap like you can get a
10:09
hundred for like $20 and they come in lots of colors so you could use Crayola super tips you could use Paper Mate
10:15
players like these if you wanted to but I like to use these dual tip brush tip
10:20
markers just because I like the way they make marks on the paper and they have the brush tip side and then they also
10:27
have like a finer point side but the fine point side still isn't fine enough when I have a lot of POVs to write on my
10:34
scene sheet so I also have other pins you can see I have the same eight colors except when it comes to yellow as we all
10:41
know you can't really read yellow very easily on note paper so I'm using orange
10:46
in place of yellow for the pins so same eight colors in markers then I also have
10:52
set these three aside I also have pins in matching colors and this particular
11:00
set of pins that I have these are SEPA pins and I got them very very inexpensively on Amazon and
11:06
I'll link as much of this stuff as I can down below in the description box but I've got these and these are just very
11:12
fine tip felt point like felt markers or pins and they write much finer than the
11:19
markers do so I'll show you how I use all this stuff but I didn't have a lighter green so I pulled out this state
11:26
lured triplets fineliner to count for the other green so sometimes you have to kind of use things that don't exactly
11:33
match these three pins are just for writing on the black or the darker index
11:39
cards because since I'm using black or dark blue the black like regular black
11:45
pin isn't going to show up on that so I've got pins like these jellyroll I think these are called like midnight
11:51
pins or something like that moon light and then this uniball signo white pin these right on dark paper like neon so
11:59
I've got those for writing on the dark index cards so the this is kind of my
12:05
tool kit so to speak and of course I don't have all this stuff usually out
12:10
all at once actually I will use my new NaNoWriMo mug I just got the mug the
12:16
hoodie and the t-shirt in the mail and I also donated so I got some of these cool postcards so we're gonna use this mug
12:23
for now to hold all these pins so this is a happy planner deluxe cover
12:30
they still sell them but I think they might be only on the website sometimes you might be able to find them at Michael's still but this is just a big
12:37
cover big happy planner cover that holds a happy planner now if you've seen my how I plot in an old happy planner video
12:44
this is basically the same system though I have updated it but I will link that video down below for you as well so you
12:49
can see here I already did a little bit of pre-planning when I was choosing the colors so this is a key that has the
12:56
stickers and the matching color so this was the brush tip side and the marker
13:02
side of the dual brush pens and then this is the little SEPA pens writing so you can see kind of the difference in
13:07
the thickness of it so this is my little key for the POV s and I try to keep it
13:13
up here in the front part of the tools that I use for getting everything set up is I will get like a new tab for this
13:20
and what I love about these disk systems is that you can pull the paper on and off and as long as you have one of these
13:26
which is like a hole punch you can punch any size or any type of letter size
13:32
paper so if you printed something out like my plotting guide for example you could punch it and put it into this
13:37
planner and you could do the same thing with like a three-ring binder anything like that but I like the disks not only
13:43
because they're pretty but also because I just like the functionality of it so I like this system so I will get all the
13:51
papers that I want to use in this plotting together so when I'm gathering my materials I will print out anything
13:58
I'm going to use like for example I created for you guys a free word tracker
14:04
for NaNoWriMo now this doesn't track your word Sprint's but it just tracks your progress and if you want to see a
14:10
walkthrough of how to use this and I will link down below it starts at 20 minutes on my how I win NaNoWriMo or why
14:19
I'm participating in aroma or one of those videos so I'll link it down below so I have one that takes you to 50,000 words that I have another one where you
14:25
can choose a custom amount of words so I'm going for more than 50,000 words so I'm going to use this one but I printed
14:31
them both out then I've got all these other sheets that I have printed out so
14:36
spoiler alert I have not actually revealed this cover and it's not to the best of the colors but this is
14:42
the cover for the book and so I like to put that in here just for inspiration
14:48
for the cover so that's what it looks like and I printed it out on this sheet then I also have old happy planner pages
14:56
so I don't even know what year this is from probably like 2017 or something then I'll show you when I'm doing the
15:03
setup how I set this up so I got those a couple of those pages to use for plot
15:08
then I have some just dot grid paper if you can see that that I purchased a
15:15
template on Etsy or like a purchase doctrine printable paper on Etsy so when I need doc grid paper I just print it
15:22
out for myself and then I use the hole punch to punch it and then I have my own
15:28
plotting guide so I printed this out eight times because I have eight points
15:33
of view now I will tell you just to talk about how I'm actually plotting eight
15:39
points of view I will fill this out for every character as detailed as I can but
15:44
for some characters like the dark one for example which I was saying I'm using the black note cards for she's only
15:50
going to have a handful of scenes in her point of view so I might not go through the entire like act 1 act 2 act 3 for
15:58
that character but I am probably going to pick out certain parts of it for my main characters Parrish Noah crash and
16:06
Carmen and probably this one also the boy for those 5 characters I will fill
16:11
this out completely in detail because each of their POVs matter now everything on these sheets might not appear in the
16:18
book but I still as the author want to know it because it's going to affect how the other characters react and act in
16:23
the story so for example when I get to crashes POV we may not see an inciting incident or an inciting event in his
16:30
point of view we might see that he and Parrish are together so we see it in parish's point of view and crash is also
16:37
sharing in it or a crash might be somewhere else and we never see his inciting event because it's not as important to the story but that's the
16:45
way you have to do it with multiple POV because if I were to take all eight of these characters fill out every tiny
16:50
little piece of like plot points for those eight characters and then write them all into the story it would either have to be
16:57
very very like fast storytelling that wouldn't give you any depth to the character or it would have to be like a
17:03
four hundred thousand word novel so that's what I've learned by writing many multiple POV novels at this point is
17:10
that you have to kind of know what everybody's plot is individually and then you have to go through the process
17:16
of weaving those together and deciding which scenes are important in which characters POV now Parrish is the
17:22
character that I consider my main character she appears on stage most often and she's really the heroine of
17:27
the story her character arc is the most important so I will fill this out in detail and we will most likely see her
17:33
entire story arc in the novel but that might not be true for every other character so just a little tip there if
17:40
you're trying to figure out multiple POV one of the sad things is that most books on plot will touch only on single POV
17:47
and only on first book in a series because they're kind of talking about stand-alones that are told from a single
17:53
point of view that's what I find to be true or you find romance ones that are specific to dual POV in a romance but
18:00
what about a fantasy novel that has eight POVs there just are no great resources on how to write that except
18:06
maybe a handful of blog posts so what I've learned about writing multiple POV in fantasy and contemporary fantasy I
18:12
have learned it by doing by writing you know ten novels that are multiple POV
18:18
and also by reading by reading Wheel of Time and a Song of Ice and Fire and a lot of other great like fantasy type
18:25
novels that have multiple POVs in them so you learn by reading then I have just
18:31
pages that I've already started filling out that have notes to them so this is where you can kind of see where I use
18:38
like washi tape in my notes and some of these are just like fast and dirty because I just wasn't being particularly
18:44
you know feeling particularly sticker II but you can kind of see how I use stickers and different colors of pins in
18:51
my planning and washi tape and things like that and this is obviously completely optional not something that
18:58
you need to do but I just enjoy doing it because it makes my notes more interesting to look at it makes them
19:03
more interesting to take and I just enjoy it because if I didn't have any cut this page in it was just all words then
19:10
it would just run together and nothing would stick out so when I'm reading this and going back through my notes it's
19:15
just easier to pay attention to them and to enjoy it and to like them when they look nice so that's just a personal
19:21
preference you don't have to do that this is also a singing great for like act 1 act 2 part 1 the midpoint you know
19:27
and so on so I will use this for like practice and I have several of these printed out for when I'm like this going through ideas for my story so that
19:35
is the materials that I use and that's the first step is getting the materials next we're going to talk about setting
19:41
them all up okay so basically like I said I would have normally just gotten them all together and then to set it up
19:47
I would go ahead and hole punch but I already did the hole punching so that I
19:52
didn't have to do that on camera so these are those happy planner pages and what I'm gonna do after I set them up is
19:58
put them into the planner but I'm gonna hold on to those for now because I'm going to set those up in a different way but basically I just would go through
20:05
and I'm gonna put all these pages onto the disks okay so this is a ridiculous
20:16
amount of papers obviously because I've got so many points of view this is quite
20:21
the undertaking to plot novels that are this big but I also use kind of thick
20:26
paper but I like that if I'm going to use the brush markers and stuff that you can't see through so there's no bleed
20:31
through or ghosting on this paper and I will link to this paper also on Amazon what I get it's a little bit more
20:38
expensive than regular paper but it is very heavy duty so the next thing I do to set up is I take these pages and I'm
20:43
going to transform them into plotting pages so let's get started so I did not mention that I will also
20:50
pick out some various types of washi tape that I want to use for the decorating of these sheets then I will
20:57
also grab headers like this and I'm kind of reaching into my drawers as I go that
21:03
are right below me I also use I'm gonna use this like adhesive paper or adhesive
21:09
thing and I'm gonna use whiteout so many things that I use for this one of the first things that I will do is go
21:15
through I don't actually need to whiteout the whole thing but I will whiteout
21:21
the tops big numbers of this because sometimes it'll show through
21:26
since I have the whiteout I'm also going to white out these lines now sometimes
21:31
when I use these for plotting a simpler story that's not as long I will leave the lines and I will use this part at
21:37
the bottom as like a note section but for this type of thing with so many points of view that's going to be over a hundred thousand words I need all the
21:44
space so I'm going to white out these lines as you can see I'm not extremely
21:50
talented when it comes to what count but I chose this particular old happy
21:57
planner because of how these the roses on it and roses are important in a lot of my different series so the next thing
22:02
I do is I start to kind of decorate the pages with washi tapes that I can cover
22:08
up the old thing so this is if you have like an old planner or happy planner in
22:14
particular sitting around this is a really great way to use it instead of throwing it away
22:21
[Music]
22:29
so it'll often be faster to cut washi tape with a credit card or like a store loyalty card and just rip it but I'm
22:36
using my scissors because I didn't want to go get something else so onward we go [Music]
22:56
okay so if you're somebody who like gets really upset that lines aren't perfect
23:01
you probably do not love what I just did but it's basically not something I worry
23:07
about that everything has to be like just perfect I just want it to be you know good
23:13
enough for me and I don't worry too much about like perfect straight lines and stuff so this is basically the original
23:20
the like main plotting sheet now I also will often take these stickers and I
23:27
will put them over here and create a key similar to this one and I probably will
23:33
go ahead and do that real quick
23:47
so I also usually will put like my goals
23:53
here I'm going to do it with the small black one so I'll say like word count
24:02
I'm just gonna put ninety five thousand for the rough draft because I know it
24:08
will end up being more than that and then I'll put a rough draft deadline and
24:14
I would usually fill that out and any other little information that I want to put like setting or you know anything
24:19
like that I might put over here so when I'm creating these particular I separate them by Act so it doesn't exactly work
24:28
out because I only have seven slots I would rather have eight but this is Act
24:34
one and then I'm gonna put a little one underneath because this is like Act one
24:39
the first half then Act two or Act one the second half then we've got Act two
24:48
the first part and Act two is really the longest part of your novel so this is
24:54
the second part and then Act two continues so this would be like the
24:59
third part of actor 2 and this would be the fourth part of Act two this is kind of just a way that makes
25:05
sense to me you could put these out however you wanted and then all of Act three usually fits in this last row all
25:12
by itself because it's usually a lot of action but it's not a lot of like plot points to hit it's just you know the
25:20
storming the castle black moment resolution kind of stuff so this is how I set up the page so once that set up I
25:28
will take it and actually put it into the planner so since I don't want these
25:33
other like empty pages to show up just something that I will do is take any
25:39
kind of adhesive and I will usually do like the corners and maybe like another
25:46
little spot here there and then I will fuse these pages or tape them together
25:52
and I just use the Rings to
25:58
match them up so there is the page now
26:04
it becomes this one page and then I'm going to put this one that's going to have doctor it on the back of it on to
26:11
the back part so now that becomes this page and I can
26:17
write notes on the back the next thing I do for setup again is totally superfluous so I'm just gonna kind of
26:23
show you what I'm doing with this washi tape oh that one's still I'm not gonna
26:29
use that one for a video even though parishes would go first and she's purple I'm just gonna go ahead and setup Noah's
26:34
here and then I'll do the rest kind of off-camera but so I would take whatever washi tape I'm going to use I would do
26:40
it in his like POV color and I would you know cover like some piece at the paper
26:47
so that when I see this paper in a set I can be like okay that's Noah's page because it's blue and so I'm only going
26:54
to use this sparkly on the very front page of his and then for the other pages
26:59
I'm going to use this skinny washi tape because I only have so much of the blue sparkly one
27:09
so when I'm setting up each POV I would do something like this and just mark the
27:15
pages with their color and you don't have to do this with washi tape but I do like to do it with some kind of thing
27:20
like either using the color to write it so I would use like the blue pen to write on this one but something that
27:26
will let you know that hey this is the blue POV you can also take like a dot
27:31
like this and put them on the edges of the pages something like this and fold
27:37
it over so that when you're flipping pages you can see whose is whose but I
27:42
would use probably a bigger dot or you could use like a big thick washi tape on the edges so that when you're kind of
27:48
looking at the stack you can see which ones are the blue pages you could turn very quickly to his POV you could also
27:55
make a washi tape flag so you could do something like this
28:03
if you wanted to tab out the pages you could just put that there and then come in whatever width or depth you wanted it
28:12
to be and then it becomes a little flag so that when you're just looking you know at the page like this you could
28:20
easily see and flip to NOAA's POV so that's another good way to use your colored washi tape and then you would
28:26
have it in all the different POVs like tabs down the page so I'll show you that once it's all set up a little bit later
28:32
so I would do that for each POV basically so that they're easy to flip through and see which colors are which
28:39
and that is basically all of the setup hey guys so it is the next morning and I
28:45
just took a little bit of time to finish setting up my plotting notebook which basically the only thing left to do was
28:51
to add the side tabs and all the colors to the pages so that when I'm flipping through like if I were to pull them out
28:57
I could easily see whose was whose because I've got the color coding on them plus it makes it easier to tab
29:03
between them another thing that I just did real quick a little while ago was I like to also make their name stand out
29:10
just make it another way to easily see whose POV I'm dealing with so I just put some marks with my brush pin and then
29:16
used the finer marker tip to write her name and this is one of the reasons that I like to use this particular paper
29:23
because you can see here that it even though I'm using a thick market didn't bleed through or even ghost on this
29:29
paper so that's one of the reasons I like to do that but before I will start filling out all of these plotting sheets
29:36
and the character sheets and everything else the next step that I actually go through is looking at the story threads
29:42
so this is going to be different process whether I am working with a book that's
29:49
later in a series or if I'm doing something that is a first book in a series or a standalone book because when
29:55
you're first starting out you don't have threads that you've started carrying through yet now you may have some ideas of threads that you want to carry
30:02
through but you don't actually have things that are true in the first and second books of a series and now you
30:08
need to carry that thread through so when I'm talking about a story thread I'm talking about something that you
30:14
know in this example I'm working on the and final book in a trilogy so what I did to begin with before I started
30:21
outlining was I went back through and I read the first and second books so as I
30:26
was reading them I pulled out all of the notes that I have for how the first two
30:32
books and the plot of those books and the things that happen in those books will affect this third and final book
30:37
plus another thing that I'm looking at like I said is threads to carry through so a story thread is something that you
30:44
think of like if you were to take a needle and a thread and start threading it through another piece of fabric
30:50
it's that woven piece of story that gets carried through the entire series so
30:56
this is something that you want to make sure is on point not only for continuity but for clarity and for you know
31:04
wrapping things up in the resolution because one of the reasons people continue reading a series is because of
31:11
these story threads if you had everything resolved in the first book then you wouldn't have a reason to go
31:19
read the second book because there would be no story questions remaining so when I am starting a new book and a series
31:25
that's later in a series I go back and I read through and I see what are the threads what are the things that
31:31
happened or things that seemed to be important about a character that need to keep being pulled through or woven
31:37
through for an example in this particular series my eternal sorrow series the characters start out with no
31:42
magical powers but as the apocalypse the zombie apocalypse begins to spread their
31:48
powers begin to not only turn on or manifest they begin to get stronger and
31:54
so you see them progress and change throughout each book so I made that short in the threads section to make a
32:00
list of the powers that manifested in book one versus the powers and how they changed and manifested in book two
32:06
because there's going to be reasons why those powers turned on in that way and that sort of thing then there's also I'm
32:13
gonna need to ramp them up so as a thread if it started out this way how does it grow and book two how does it grow and book three so the first plan of
32:20
attack when I'm writing series books is to go back through the first few books and keep track of those story threads
32:27
now if you were super super organized like I am a little bit more with my shadow demon saga I have already
32:33
notebooks full of those threads without having to necessarily go back and read which I do actually do anyway but I do
32:40
have notebooks to have those threads but for this series I didn't have that in this particular series things have
32:45
changed a lot so like from when I first started writing them so I definitely had to go back and start reading and I might
32:51
actually go back in and read again but anyway there's just different little threads that you want to carry through
32:57
there's a thread about dreams so crash has been having certain kinds of dreams so that becomes part of the threads that
33:03
I have to carry through because if I forgot about that and I started writing book 3 and the final book in the series
33:09
and didn't mention crashes dreams that I'm doing a disservice to the reader and to my story because it was important in
33:16
books 1 and 2 and now I can't just drop it so it's important as writers especially when we're writing a series
33:22
to figure out what those threads are and continue to pull them through so that readers don't forget and so that we
33:27
address the issues and make it important because why would the why would he be having dreams unless they're important
33:32
to the story in some way so it's just being intentional about your story it's about remembering all those threads so
33:38
that's where I start because I want to make sure that these things appear in my outline and they're naturally going to
33:43
affect the story and especially when you're finishing a series you want to make sure you you not only bring those
33:50
threads through but you resolve as many of them as you can if not all of them so
33:56
you know why this was important or why this happened and every you know anything that was a question that the
34:01
reader might have had has an answer now so that's all going to play into the actual plot and outlining of your story
34:07
so that's the first thing I do is I go in and I write these threads down then I will actually just start brainstorming
34:13
scenes that I can use so these are scenes that I have either written in a
34:19
previous book and pulled out because they weren't right or I like like if I had written it in book 2 but then it
34:25
didn't quite fit into book 2 I might write it and use it in book 3 in this particular story I had an you know a
34:32
longer book that I wrote in 2009 that I then expanded so I still have plot from
34:39
that original book a decade ago that I'm trying to see can I use those in this third book at all so I have
34:45
brainstorm many pages of scenes and things that I think might need to happen in this book sometimes I think of it in
34:51
this way if this were a movie or a series of movies that or a television show that I was watching if I close my
34:59
eyes and I imagine these characters continuing on with the story from where they were at the end of book two what
35:05
can I see in my head plus you know I've I haven't written this next book in a while and as we all do we just you know
35:12
sometimes we'll be in the shower or you'll be out for a walk or you're driving your car and you'll get an idea for a scene that would be cool and you
35:18
can kind of see it playing through in your head and maybe you don't know how it attaches to the rest of the story you
35:24
don't know where it belongs but you know that it could be a cool scene and sometimes it might just be a small bit
35:29
of dialogue that happens between two characters or it could be a really big scene that you know so this is the point
35:35
where once I figured out all the threads that need to carry through I'll go through and brainstorm the different
35:41
scenes that I know I want to put into the book and sometimes these scenes won't make it in but they're just ideas
35:46
that I've had so far about the scenes and then as I'm doing that I also will kind of bring in the threads and how
35:52
they apply to the scenes that I've already kind of imagined for myself so this is like story and scene brainstorm
35:59
and this is valuable for me to do all of this stuff and ask myself the questions that I want to ask to help pull the
36:05
story out of me before I actually start officially going through and filling out these character sheets sometimes this
36:13
can take me a couple days sometimes it can take me a few months to do this part of the process where I just sit down and
36:19
I start brainstorming the threads the characters what needs to happen what scenes need to happen but once the
36:25
threads are done once I've made lots of notes about the different scenes that I might want to use then I will go back to
36:32
the character sheets and this is of course more time-consuming the more points of view that you have but since
36:39
this story has eight points of view I need to get cracking on it because I need to understand where the story is
36:45
going before NaNoWriMo begins in about a week I would go through these sheets and
36:50
if you want to see in more detail what these sheets mean and why you know what exactly is a
36:55
or what exactly is the dramatic question then I will link for you that plotting series that I did where I talk about all
37:03
of those things so I would go through one piece at a time and focus on each character now because I've written out
37:09
all my threads or the things I know to be true about that character in the previous book it makes it easier for me
37:15
but you would also do this if you were starting a brand new book and just starting to explore this character so
37:20
you'd be thinking about what is their deepest desire like what's their wound what happened in their past and if you're deeper into a series you need to
37:27
be thinking about like they had that wound in the past how have they already started to overcome it and what's going
37:32
to happen in this book that pulls them into the final version that we're going to see of them that final person because
37:39
this is the last book in a series so it's going to depend where you are in the series so for my shadow demon saga
37:44
the next book that I'm writing is book eleven in this series but there will be a twelfth book so I wouldn't want to
37:49
pull Harper into her final person like we're the way we're gonna see her where
37:55
everything's resolved at the end but I'm going to actually challenge her even
38:00
more in book eleven so that she can grow in book twelve into the person she needs to be to defeat or to fight that final
38:07
battle so you're always thinking where you are in the series because if I had
38:12
resolved everything about Parrish in book one then where would that character grow in books two and three so you need
38:19
to think about how long your series is going to be and where your character arc is in terms of you know how far she's
38:26
gonna grow in each book and sometimes you don't know I originally thought beautiful demons like my shadow demon
38:31
saga was gonna be three books and like I said I'm going to be writing 12 now and then who knows after that I think that'll be the end but you never know so
38:38
there's always places you can take your characters new places to take them but it's good idea to have some sort of
38:45
intention in terms of you know giving them what they need in this book to overcome whatever the challenge is of
38:51
this particular book but also thinking down the line of what you're where you're going to take that character but
38:56
when I'm filling this out for each of these characters I'm going to fill it out with the thought of okay where do I want this character to end up not only
39:03
by the end of this book but by the end of this series how am I going to close out her character and do her justice so
39:08
that's the these first two pages goal motivation and conflict is super important and then
39:14
again here we're talking about the character of the beginning middle and end and even here even though I'm talking about this particular book I
39:20
probably since this the last book in the series will think about where the character was in the beginning in the first book in the second book and now by
39:27
the end of the third book so that I can see her character progression from the start of book 1 all the way to the end
39:33
of book 3 then I will actually go through and I will fill out the plot
39:38
points for each character and like I mentioned before you might not actually see on screen every single plot point
39:46
from every single character but it's still important for me to know what their plot points are so I will go
39:51
through and fill all of this stuff out for at least four my main characters so I just basically start thinking about it
39:58
now often what tends to happen for me when I'm outlining is I have a pretty good idea of what's happening here in
40:04
act 1 so this usually comes to me pretty quickly because this is sort of the story set up the original like the first
40:10
inciting event the key event that pulls them into the story the main part of this book but often what's happening in
40:17
the middle of you know the act two parts one like first half and second half is often very muddled I might have an idea
40:24
of what's happening at this midpoint or what their Mirror moment is but often I don't know all the details of their
40:30
choices the tests the challenges they're going to face so instead of trying to figure that out and just sit down and
40:35
think about it I actually will flip to the end so I often work on Act one and
40:40
then Act three because if I can figure out where they where they begin and then where they need to go by the end I can
40:48
usually start to see some of those scenes in the middle because I I can see like bookends where they're going so now
40:55
I just have to figure out how they get there so I will do a process of working from the beginning and then working in
41:02
the back so once I've hit Act two I will go ahead and turn to Act three instead
41:07
and I'll skip it and I'll start thinking about what is the final battle what's the final thing they have to fight here
41:12
to get to the resolution of the entire series then I'll start thinking about the black moment and how they're going
41:18
to make a plan to get there and if I need to put them into this location in whatever they're in and make this the worst
41:25
challenge of the entire novel then I can start thinking okay how do they get there like what would be this second
41:31
doorway and I sort of work from the back and not just become my process and after 25 novels
41:37
this really works for me if I get stuck working my way back I'll come back into the new world and start working my way
41:42
forward until those two things meet and I will fill out as much of this as I possibly can then what I will do once
41:49
I've got this filled out now like I said there may be some holes so I might not know their original plan or I might not
41:56
understand what the first pinch point is here but I usually by the time I move on to Singh's list or go on to the next
42:02
character I will have all of act 1 all of act 3 and usually at least the midpoint and a few let things like the
42:09
second door wait like the main plot points will usually be filled out then I will move to this final page that has
42:15
docked grid here for my scenes list so any of those scenes that I had pulled
42:21
out and threads that I had decided were important to the story I will work in to this so if I had parish's abilities and
42:28
powers I will make sure that I have scenes here or her power is growing or becoming more of a challenge so I've got
42:35
all those threads in mind all those scenes in mind then once I have this entire thing filled out to the best of
42:41
my ability at the beginning of the plotting process or the outlining process I will create a scenes list that
42:47
should just the scenes in parish's point of view and this is important for me because this is really all about not
42:54
only her action that she's going to take and decisions that she has to make but about her character arc most importantly
42:59
so this will include any types of scenes where I feel like it's going to be most important from beginning to end that her
43:06
that happened in her point of view and then I just rinse and repeat and I do that for each character and sometimes
43:12
like I'll make it all the way out to crashes and I'm filling out his stuff and realizing what's going to happen
43:18
here and then I'll think oh okay well if this happens in his point of view then I'm gonna turn around and get some ideas
43:25
for what might happen in perishes and so as I'm working my way through each of the POVs some of these first characters
43:32
act two tests and challenges will become more clear so on like switching back and forth which is
43:38
why the tabs become important because as I work through each character it clarifies what's going on with the other
43:45
characters in this story and like I said sometimes not everything is gonna end up
43:50
here like meet the antagonist or introduce the mystery for crash might be the same thing that's happening for the
43:56
other four because they're all together that or the other three because they're all together at this part of the story so when you're writing multiple POV you
44:03
just kind of have to know what's going to happen where they're all in a group and then what's going to happen just to
44:08
crash or just to know or just to this one other character if you are writing a single POV then you would just you
44:15
wouldn't have to worry about the other characters you would just figure it out for this one person's point of view what's happening but it just gets a
44:20
little bit more complicated when you're writing multiple POV so then I would do the same thing for each character and
44:26
write out scenes that I know are happening in crashes point of view so if I already knew that the scene where I
44:33
introduced the mystery or the antagonist is happening in parish's point of view then I don't have to rewrite it on
44:39
crashes scene list this is only crashes scenes in order of how they happen in
44:44
the story once I have finished and filled all of this out for every single character then I will turn to these
44:52
sheet appear that have the four columns similar to the way I've got this in the
44:59
front that also has the four columns or well actually has more than four columns
45:05
it has seven but it has act 1 act 2 act 2 part two and then act 3 here so what I
45:11
would start to do is use this as a kind of a practice sheet so what I might do here is just just take this and this
45:18
will be all of Act one this would be all of Act two part one act 2 part two or
45:25
the second half and then this would be my ideas for act 3 and the reason I don't just start writing immediately on
45:32
the happy planner part of it is because I want this to be pretty much as close
45:37
to the final thing I'm writing as possible and I just can't know that I've got eight different characters with all
45:42
kinds of stuff happening and I don't know how I'm going to weave those in now if like I said before it was just this
45:49
one character with a bunch of scenes in that one POV it might be easier to just go ahead and
45:54
start plotting it out on the main pages because it's just her POV but when you have multiple you not only need to know
46:00
the scenes but you need to know how they interact with each other what's the right order because you have to start
46:06
thinking about pacing so if you guys want to see a video about how to pace your novel let me know or like more
46:11
crafts type videos let me know but what I start doing when I'm in this part of
46:16
the outlining process is really just exploring how I might paste the novel so this is where my different colored pins
46:24
would really come in handy so instead of wasting a bunch of stickers on this I would just use the colored pins and
46:30
usually would put a little dot here so I know this is like purple for parish and
46:35
instead of having to write perish perish perish I would know that purple is perish and then I would say like
46:41
something like wakes up from a nightmare
46:46
or whatever is her thing and then I might say like if if nois was going to
46:52
be the next scene I would pull from his scene list and say okay his first scene is them walking back to the compound and
47:03
I would make notes about that scene and I would start to weave them in and figure out what order they go in until
47:09
it brings me down to the very bottom scene which is going to be something that's like the first doorway or the
47:17
first plot point so it's like oh they're attacked by so-and-so so that would be
47:23
this plot point so I would just continue to do this now as I'm doing this and as
47:28
I'm trying to figure out how they get to the end I'm probably going to hit some places where it's like even though I've written this down I get down here and I
47:34
realize oh I really should have put Noah's scene later into the story and it
47:40
will just begin to become more clear as I go so that's why I have several of these types of sheets print it out
47:45
because I'm gonna fill it out it's not gonna work so I'm gonna take what I've learned here pull out the next sheet do it again and
47:52
then try to weave them together and even when I feel like it's pretty good sometimes it's inevitable that when I'm
47:59
writing it's going to change again and that's one of the things that I think a lot of people don't allow
48:05
themselves to do when they're writing is they don't realize that it is going to morph and change and you can try to plot
48:11
and plan an outline as much as you want but for most of us as you write it's going to shift and change again like a
48:17
lot of times I'm going to get to the end of Act one and that scene is going to come out slightly different in the
48:22
writing then I thought it would or then I expected to see it and so that's going to affect everything that happens
48:28
afterward and you just have to embrace that now if you try to like if it
48:34
naturally comes out one way and you try to go back and force it into the other way you're gonna end up with a novel that's probably not very good you need
48:40
to trust your intuition but this is part of my main plotting process so once I've
48:46
got this filled out several times and I feel like it's pretty good then I will
48:51
go through and I will add that here to the plotting sheet and I will use the stickers in that instance so I'll take
48:58
like the purple sticker and put it here and then I'll fill out parish's thing and I'll have this whole thing will be
49:03
full of stickers and scenes and it'll be written out much more nicer than my like chicken scratch in the like
49:09
brainstorming sheets then once that is completely filled out I'll go back to these note cards that I showed you and I
49:17
will fill out the note cards with each scene now it may seem like overkill so if this is not something that appeals to
49:23
you then don't use it but this is just me showing you how I do it and how after twenty five novels many of them being
49:29
multiple POV I have found it the easiest because the more preparation I put personally on the front end the easier
49:37
and the faster the writing flows if I don't go through this process on a multiple POV novel like I said romances
49:44
are easier for me and single POV books are easier for me but when I've got
49:49
these like more than two points of view if I don't go through the process of figuring out how the scenes weave
49:54
together putting them into this thing so I can see how they fit together on like a one-page two-page spread and then also
50:02
adding details of each scene onto the note cards then the writing often becomes very very slow but if I put in a
50:10
couple of weeks worth of work on to the outlining then the writing usually goes by in a flash so I have found that it's
50:16
worth that for me to do this big long drawn-out process of the color coding and the scenes weaving together and all
50:23
of that and like I've said a million times this may not work for you I'm not in any way saying this is the way you
50:28
should do it I'm just showing you an example of how I do it and hoping that maybe that will spark something and you
50:34
can try it and see what works for you and then adapt it because I am never the kind of person that says there's one way
50:39
I think there's a million ways and the is your job as the author to figure out what your process is and sometimes you
50:45
can find it because other people shared theirs so once I have a basic
50:51
description of the scenes I will elaborate on what's happening in that scene on the note cards so let's say for
50:57
example this first scene is Parrish wakes up from a nightmare and has a conversation with Noah about what
51:04
they're gonna do next that's I would write something here very simple that says like wakes up from
51:09
nightmare convo with Noah and that may be all it says on here to kind of trigger the scene but I need to have
51:16
more of an idea of what's happening in that scene and why so that's where the note card comes in handy is I would pull
51:22
out my purple note card for parish's point of view and I would elaborate on that I would say Parrish wakes up from a
51:27
nightmare about her sister and it feels hauntingly or chillingly real and then she has a conversation with Noah who has
51:34
already awakened guarding the door about what they're going to do next they share their fears and Parrish tells him that
51:41
even if nobody else is willing to go to New York she's going regardless so I've got all of that written down on this
51:48
note card sometimes I will also write what I think is adding tension to the
51:53
scene what's the conflict and how do I want to portray those emotions and often I will write like how I want the scene
51:59
to end like how do they exit the scene so I'll write Carmen wakes up and interrupts them just before they kiss or
52:05
whatever so that becomes the first note card then if the next scene is happening
52:11
in Noah's point-of-view I would pull out the blue note card and I would write his until I have every single scene with as
52:18
much on it as I know now their son might be some scenes in the Middle where it would be like I don't know what's
52:23
happening in the scene but I know I want something from crashes point of view where he's going to
52:29
do something that is secretive but I might not know what that is yet and I'm gonna leave that to my intuition as I'm
52:36
writing but I'm still gonna include a note card where I say crash does something in secret with a question mark
52:41
and I'm still gonna put it where it belongs in the order of scenes and then when I'm coming to it I'm gonna have
52:47
given myself a couple weeks potentially to let my subconscious mind work on what it is that crash is trying to hide from
52:53
everyone and then hopefully when I get there I'll know what it is so that is my
52:58
outlining process if you guys would like to see an update on this at the end of
53:04
the outlining process where you can actually see it all filled in please leave a comment down below and let me
53:09
know because right now I haven't gone through the work now I did plot out this novel last year at the end of last year
53:16
but I didn't like the direction and I got stuck so that's why I have decided instead of trying to continue to work on
53:23
my old outline for NaNoWriMo I am going to dedicate myself to filling all of
53:29
this out so at the beginning of November you guys want to see all of it done and how it looks please comment down below
53:35
but this is basically an overview of my process the reason this becomes magical is because when I sit down to write on
53:41
November 1st I'm not gonna have any doubt about which scene comes next or what's happening in that scene I am
53:47
going to sit down and I'm gonna pull out the first note card and I'm gonna say okay this is what I'm writing and I'm gonna set my 20-minute timer and I'm
53:53
gonna work on this scene and see how it comes out and when this scene is done I just turned to the next note card and I
54:00
write what's on here and that will continue for the majority of the book but it will happen inevitably that I'll
54:07
get to a scene that changes everything and I might have to go back through midway Andry plot a few things or move
54:14
things around and that's just part of the process but starting the book knowing what these scenes are and
54:20
knowing that I have a plan makes it write so much faster rather than sitting there every sprint thinking I'm not sure
54:27
what's gonna happen or you know it just you meander around the story a lot more I plot within an inch of the story's
54:35
life and then I surrender to the fact that things are going to change and they're going to morph and they're going
54:40
to grow as they go and I trust my own intuition at this point and I trust my process I know that this
54:46
is a great way for my brain to feel like I'm in control of the story and it convinces me to get started and to not
54:53
be afraid of it and then once I get into the story I trust that it's going to come out the way that it needs to even
54:58
if it means throwing half the outline out it wasn't a waste of time because it got me writing and it got me to where I
55:04
could figure out the story okay guys that is my very long and detailed look at how I outlined my novel if you'd like
55:11
to see more smaller shorter videos on some of the details of how I actually
55:16
put together my plot and my outlines please let me know or more videos on craft please comment down below and let
55:22
me know and I can plan those for the rest of the year or in my 2020 content I hope that you enjoyed this if you did

Planning For Wr
hey guys welcome back to my channel and
0:02
today since I'm on deadline and I'm
0:04
rushing to get everything ready and
0:06
paying attention to all the details and
0:08
it has all my focus I'm gonna record for
0:11
you guys today a mini marketing tip and
0:13
the first of my mini marketing tips is
0:15
the punchy one-liner alright so I think
0:23
a lot of people when they think about
0:25
marketing their books they're just
0:27
thinking about advertising telling other
0:29
people about your books and that sort of
0:31
thing like how can I pay for marketing
0:33
how can I rearrange these things to get
0:36
more people's eyes on my books and all
0:38
that is part of your marketing but a lot
0:40
of what I'm going to teach you here at
0:42
heart breathing's including my series on
0:44
how to build a best-selling series is
0:46
all about sort of building your
0:48
marketing from the ground up instead of
0:50
getting the product ready and throwing
0:53
it up there and then later deciding how
0:55
you're gonna get eyes on it try to build
0:57
your series from the beginning with a
0:59
lot of great marketing already like
1:01
inherently in the series and today's
1:03
mini marketing tip is all about your
1:05
blurb and having a punchy sort of
1:08
one-liner hook that gets people
1:10
immediately into your story think about
1:13
for example movies when you've got that
1:16
movie poster or somebody is talking
1:18
about this great TV show that's going to
1:20
be coming out or like season 2 of
1:22
whatever there's usually that punchy
1:25
little thing that would go like right
1:28
there on the movie poster I didn't
1:30
actually get a lot of examples from
1:31
movies but if you go to it used to be
1:34
like TV Guide would be a great place to
1:36
go look for this so if you still have
1:37
your like you know TiVo or whatever DVRs
1:40
and your going and looking your digital
1:42
cable go and look at the descriptions
1:45
that they have for some of the movies
1:46
that are out there because sometimes
1:48
those one-liners are terrible but
1:49
sometimes they're like a goldmine or go
1:52
on to Google and search for a show that
1:55
you really like like the Vampire Diaries
1:56
and look for like images or teaser
1:59
images and see what kinds of like
2:02
one-liners people pulled out because
2:03
sometimes you can really start to get a
2:05
good idea of what works as that punchy
2:08
one-liner what you're aiming
2:10
or is you know when someone says what's
2:12
your book about that you can go boom and
2:15
they go oh my god I got to read that if
2:17
you can get that little one-liner that
2:20
intrigues it doesn't have to explain
2:22
your whole story now you're gonna have
2:23
to write your blurb that's gonna explain
2:24
you know the basics of like description
2:27
of your book like the back cover copy of
2:29
the book and that's super important and
2:31
you know we'll talk about writing great
2:33
blurbs another time but what I'm talking
2:35
about is that kind of catchphrase that
2:38
could go maybe at the beginning of your
2:40
blurb or if you're running an ad on
2:42
Facebook what I'm also talking about
2:44
here is that punchy one-liner that may
2:47
not even super describe your book but
2:49
it's something that the minute people
2:51
hear it they immediately are intrigued
2:54
they're really interested it conveys
2:56
sense of the genre that you're writing
2:59
it conveys that high concept hook that
3:02
is great for ad copy so at the front of
3:05
your website when you're doing teasers
3:08
and you're posting them on websites or
3:09
on Facebook or on social media if you
3:12
are running a Facebook ad you know
3:16
having that great one-liner at the top
3:18
that just makes people stop in their
3:20
tracks like all they have to do is read
3:22
that one line and immediately they want
3:24
to read your book it's gonna be so much
3:26
easier now you can also run Amazon ads
3:29
they're called AMS ads and if you look
3:32
like go to Amazon and you look on the
3:36
AMS ads like sponsored products
3:38
underneath the books you'll see a lot of
3:40
like one or two line descriptions for
3:43
those books now people are paying for
3:45
those ads and they're deciding what goes
3:47
in so you're the one it's the author
3:49
that makes those decisions about what's
3:51
going to go in that little space there
3:53
underneath the book cover and you've
3:55
literally got like 50 books in a
3:57
carousel there so if you want to catch
3:59
their eye other than your book cover you
4:02
got to have that punchy description so
4:04
writing a great punchy description is
4:06
key for your advertising for describing
4:09
your book and for getting readers
4:11
immediately intrigued people have very
4:13
short attention spans these days so it's
4:15
important to get them as quickly as
4:17
possible I'm gonna give you some
4:19
examples and I'm gonna put my glasses on
4:20
so that I can read them because I've got
4:22
them here on my compete
4:23
so for example big little lies a lot of
4:26
you may know this from HBO just did a
4:29
miniseries it's a book by Liane Moriarty
4:31
and it's amazing well if you look at the
4:34
front of her blurb on Amazon it says a
4:36
murder a tragic accident or just parents
4:40
behaving badly
4:41
what's indisputable is that someone is
4:43
dead I mean that's pretty brilliant it's
4:46
just two short lines very punchy if
4:49
someone saw that along with the book
4:50
cover they would immediately buy it
4:52
which is why it's one of these hugely
4:54
best-selling books but it gives you an
4:56
idea that this is a mystery but it also
4:58
is about parents it's about whether this
5:01
is this was a murder or an accident and
5:03
it gives you some of that idea of the
5:05
drama that's going to go on between
5:06
those parents throughout the book so it
5:08
gives you a lot of that an example from
5:10
mine deep dark secrets which is a ye
5:12
paranormal mystery my one-liner is the
5:15
deadliest secrets are the ones we keep
5:17
from ourselves which immediately you
5:20
know it's a mystery you know they're
5:21
secrets involved and you know there's
5:23
some sort of psychological thing going
5:25
on there like what secrets could she
5:27
possibly be keeping from herself
5:29
Helen Harper is an urban fantasy author
5:31
and she has a great series called slouch
5:33
witch and it's about a lazy witch like
5:35
it's it's so fun but her little tagline
5:39
at the very beginning of that book blurb
5:41
is hard work will pay off later
5:43
laziness pays off now it lets you know
5:45
there's gonna be humor in this it lets
5:47
you know that lazy you know the the
5:49
character is gonna be this lazy witch
5:50
you know hard work will pay off later I
5:52
don't really want to do it so between
5:54
the book cover and that great little
5:55
one-liner a punchy one-liner she's got
5:59
you hooked already if you're looking for
6:00
something that is fun and urban fantasy
6:04
Emily Sears push and pull the first book
6:06
of her vampire favorite series never
6:09
make a deal with a vampire it always
6:11
comes back to bite you really great
6:13
punchy one-liner they're actually two
6:15
lines but you know what I'm saying just
6:17
scrolling through those sponsored
6:18
product ads on Amazon I saw one by Emma
6:21
L Adams called celestial magic that says
6:23
chosen by heaven marked by Hell which
6:26
will she choose that gives you a good
6:29
idea of what the conflict is and
6:32
you know you immediately with asking
6:34
that question you immediately want to
6:35
know well which one is she gonna choose
6:36
meant to be just a totally different
6:39
kind of example from a contemporary
6:40
romance melody grace is meant to be says
6:42
what happens when this unlucky and love
6:45
romance author goes searching for her
6:47
soulmate and finds true love waiting in
6:49
Sweetbriar Cove that immediately it
6:52
gives you that question so you do hey
6:54
what does happen I want to know but it
6:56
also gives you you know a sense of
6:58
character she's an unlucky and love
7:00
romance author but she's searching for
7:01
her soulmate and you find out about you
7:04
get interested in Sweetbriar code so
7:07
what is that oh it sounds like a beach
7:08
small town romance it gives you that
7:11
feel for exactly what that series is
7:13
about so if someone's looking for it
7:15
they're going to immediately want to
7:17
clue in on that so if your book is humor
7:19
put a little bit of humor in that
7:22
one-liner if your book is mystery put
7:24
something about the mystery and intrigue
7:26
in there if you can come up with
7:28
something that immediately grabs your
7:31
attention it has that punch to it it
7:33
just has that little bit of like ooh
7:35
that sounds great
7:37
you're gonna be so much better off I
7:38
worked with a couple on my ads for
7:41
beautiful demons and my beautiful demons
7:43
boxset that have worked really well and
7:45
sometimes it takes practicing putting
7:47
them up there seeing how people react
7:49
asking your friends asking readers what
7:51
do you think of this putting it up on
7:52
teasers see how many people respond to
7:54
it or react to it and you may go through
7:57
lots before you really find those
7:59
one-liners that really have the punch
8:01
but it's worth it to spend the time on
8:03
it because you're gonna use it in
8:04
advertising every time you talk about
8:05
your book book blogs teasers all of that
8:09
so take the time ahead of time when you
8:11
start to you know when you're done
8:12
writing your book and you're about to
8:13
publish it to write three or four my two
8:16
bests performing ones for my beautiful
8:18
demon series are dark secrets hide
8:21
within which worked great because
8:23
there's a picture of a house on the
8:26
cover and the girls walking toward it so
8:28
it's kind of like what dark secrets are
8:30
in there and my second one was never
8:34
trust the popular girls and I ran a
8:37
facebook ad using just like a picture of
8:40
a strength like a girl just kind of
8:42
staring at you kind
8:43
a creepy picture that really caught your
8:45
eye and then at the top never trust the
8:48
popular girls dot dot and I am Telling
8:51
You I got thousands of clicks tens of
8:53
thousands of clicks on that ad for
8:55
people that are interested in my book
8:57
based on the advertising so hopefully
8:59
you can see the power of really taking
9:02
some time thinking about your book
9:03
making sure you're giving an idea of
9:05
genre and the tone of your book in this
9:08
blurb II kind of like one or two line
9:10
thing because trust me when it comes to
9:13
your advertising your Twitter feed any
9:16
of your social media that you're wanting
9:17
to get people's attention to really fast
9:19
one of the best ways to do that is with
9:21
your punchy one-liner that gets them
9:24
right in and one of the traps that I see
9:26
people have is they want to like
9:31
describe their whole book in it but come
9:33
up with something that's really short
9:35
and punchy it could be one line it could
9:36
be two lines maybe you could stretch it
9:38
to three line if they were really short
9:39
but coming up with maybe two or three if
9:43
you could sit down and brainstorm the
9:45
ten and then start running them by
9:47
people I think you could really start to
9:49
tweak some and find a really good set of
9:51
options put it at the top of your blurb
9:54
put it on all your advertising when you
9:56
do social media posts and teasers you
9:58
use that because it will immediately
10:00
draw people in to your series all right
10:03
guys that is it for this very short mini
10:06
marketing tip from heart breathings I
10:08
hope you enjoyed it and I will see you
10:10
guys soon bye
10:14
[Music]
hey guys welcome back to heart
0:01
breathing's I am so excited to see you
0:03
here for our final video of eight where
0:06
I have been talking about some of the
0:07
top lessons learned and top advice after
0:10
eight years of successful self
0:12
publishing so today's tip is number
0:15
eight as the final tip on my list even
0:17
though I probably could go on and on
0:19
about tips for a very long time but one
0:22
of my top top tips for you is to focus
0:25
on joy guys it is so easy to get wrapped
0:33
up in the business side of you know
0:36
marketing and hustle and you know
0:38
comparing and trying to be better trying
0:40
to you know like we want this career so
0:43
badly most of us that get into this
0:45
we're doing it because we truly love to
0:48
write we really want to reach those
0:50
readers we've been admiring other
0:52
authors for most of our lifetimes and we
0:54
just want to have that kind of career
0:56
but sometimes we want it so badly that
0:59
you know we're always focused on that
1:01
next level but I want to have that
1:03
bestseller or I want to have that
1:04
breakout hit and you know it's really
1:06
the kind of career like I said in one of
1:08
my earlier tips that builds over time it
1:11
takes patience it takes a long time to
1:13
build up a successful career in writing
1:15
years most of the time it can be easy to
1:18
focus on you know how badly we want it
1:21
how much we're not quite getting there
1:23
how long it's taking you know all of
1:25
those kinds of things and it can be
1:27
really easy in our pursuit of trying to
1:30
get to that next level to kind of push
1:33
the writing to the side and the writing
1:35
becomes really really stressful because
1:37
we're trying to do it really quickly and
1:39
we're trying to make sure that it fits
1:40
into this mold of like books that are
1:42
gonna sell or whatever and then we focus
1:44
on you know the business side of it well
1:47
I need to focus on you know putting out
1:49
this mini AMS ads and I should be on
1:51
every single you know social media
1:53
platform and I need to be hustling over
1:55
here and hustling over here and before
1:57
you know it you could end up in a career
1:58
where you're literally working 10 to 12
2:01
hours a day
2:02
hardly ever seeing your family I know
2:04
authors who are writing on Christmas Day
2:06
pulling up Facebook ads on New Year's
2:09
Eve never spending time with their
2:11
family they haven't been
2:12
vacation in years and I was one of those
2:14
writers just a few short years ago I
2:16
completely burned out and could not
2:18
write anymore because I realized you
2:20
know I was working 60 plus hours a week
2:22
sometimes way more than 60 hours a week
2:25
which meant that I was not really
2:27
sleeping a lot I was hardly seeing my
2:29
family and I was stressed all the time
2:32
because I was working so hard toward a
2:34
goal that it's very very difficult to
2:36
get when you're not focused on joy and
2:38
you're not focused on you know the
2:40
things that truly matter so one of the
2:43
top tips that I have for you that I hope
2:45
that you will hear from my heart to
2:47
yours is that no matter where you are in
2:50
this business it is important to always
2:52
keep your focus on joy yes you have to
2:55
learn the business side you need to
2:57
understand how to run a successful
2:59
business because you are becoming a
3:01
business owner when you become a
3:03
self-published author but if you want to
3:06
be happy in this career and I think that
3:08
you wouldn't really be doing it if you
3:10
didn't hope to be happy and successful
3:12
then you have to leave room for the joy
3:16
in your career and in your life and you
3:19
know what happened to me was I hit this
3:22
point where I was making multiple six
3:24
figures I had my very best years or my
3:27
very best few months of my entire career
3:29
and I fell into a very deep depression
3:32
and this is not unusual it blew my mind
3:36
to learn that but it's really not
3:38
unusual because I think that throughout
3:41
my whole career I just kept saying
3:43
things like I'll slow down when I'll be
3:46
happy when and I always had some kind of
3:49
qualifier like I'll slow down when you
3:52
know I have a $25,000 month or when I
3:55
have a thirty thousand dollar month or
3:57
you know once I hit 500,000 sales I'll
4:00
get to slow down a little bit or once I
4:02
finish this series I'll slow down once
4:04
we have a bigger house once we can
4:05
afford XYZ once we can get that new car
4:08
then I can slow down and what I realized
4:11
was I was constantly pushing my
4:13
happiness down the road like I was
4:14
kicking a can down the road I was
4:16
constantly saying like okay well now
4:18
that I've got half a million sales I'm
4:20
still not satisfied what I need to do is
4:22
you know
4:23
got to work a little bit harder and I've
4:24
got to work on this next goal and I was
4:26
pushing myself so hard and I wasn't
4:29
focused on the joy I wasn't focused on
4:31
why I loved to write and why I really
4:33
wanted this career I wasn't even focused
4:35
on what I truly wanted I was just
4:38
focused on whatever that next big thing
4:40
the next house the next big sale the
4:42
next this whatever and every time I
4:44
would hit that next milestone it
4:47
wouldn't fulfill me and I didn't
4:49
understand why so then I would push the
4:51
can't you know kick the can down the
4:53
road a little bit more wait for that
4:55
next milestone work my butt off till I
4:57
got it I would hit it and I would think
4:59
why isn't this making me happy and what
5:01
I had to step back and realize once I
5:03
had that huge burnout was that the the
5:06
milestones are great and we should
5:08
celebrate every single one along the way
5:10
but it's really not
5:12
those outside things you know that
5:14
moment in time Oh half a million sales
5:16
or you know $20,000 a month or you know
5:22
2,000 fans in my Facebook group or
5:24
whatever those are not the things that
5:26
are going to bring you joy is the
5:28
day-to-day work that really makes up
5:30
your life all 500,000 sales is is a
5:33
moment in time where you go cool I sold
5:36
half a million books and it's awesome
5:39
and I'm grateful for it and if you can
5:41
get to that level it is gonna make you
5:43
feel good and you should go out to
5:44
dinner and have a celebration and all
5:46
that stuff but it is not like your life
5:48
is suddenly different or you suddenly
5:50
are a happier person because you hit
5:52
this level of income or you hit this
5:54
level of sales it doesn't change your
5:56
life like that it's just a thing you can
5:58
now say about what you've accomplished
6:00
and it's wonderful and it's worth
6:02
celebrating but it is not going to
6:04
drastically change your life to be able
6:07
to just say that oh I did XYZ or to live
6:11
in a certain kind of house or you know
6:13
anything that is outside of yourself and
6:15
so one of the things that I've really
6:17
really learned and have taken to heart
6:19
lately is that it's really about that
6:23
day-to-day journey and about what's
6:25
happening in my head and in my heart
6:26
when I learned to really get back to the
6:29
joy of writing like why was I doing this
6:32
in the first place what did I most want
6:34
to get out of this career and I
6:36
started focusing on the things that
6:37
brought me joy on a day-to-day basis
6:40
then it suddenly didn't matter as much
6:42
what those daily sales are it didn't
6:44
matter as much how many books I had sold
6:46
what mattered was am i happy today with
6:49
what I'm writing and am I you know
6:52
moving in the direction I want to go and
6:54
there are still times when I get bogged
6:56
down or I start to compare myself to
6:58
other people or I start to think about
7:00
you know that next level like yes I want
7:03
to buy a mansion on the marsh with a
7:05
deep-water dock that's close to the
7:07
beach it's like I want that life I want
7:09
to drive the car that I want to drive
7:10
and you know I would love to be a USA
7:13
Today bestseller there's lots of things
7:14
that I want but I no longer hold those
7:17
things out as like I'll be happy when
7:19
and I'm gonna be okay
7:21
being miserable and hustling and
7:22
striving and working as hard as I can
7:24
every day 60 hours a week or whatever to
7:28
get that and then when I get that
7:29
expecting that moment in time or that
7:32
house or that car to make me happy
7:34
because I know better if I truly want to
7:36
be happy I have to be happy right here
7:38
sitting in my rental house in my office
7:41
exactly where I am right now if I can do
7:44
that then I can joyfully every single
7:47
day work toward that goal of getting
7:49
that mansion on the marsh because if I
7:52
made myself miserable over the next five
7:54
years to get that mansion suddenly
7:56
moving into that mansion doesn't mean
7:57
like oh now I've made it and I never
7:59
have to work again and I can take a
8:01
five-year nap right that's not what it
8:03
means it means you're still gonna have
8:04
to hustle hard to afford that monthly
8:05
payment on that mansion on the marsh
8:07
right it is so much more satisfying to
8:09
be joyfull along the way I would so much
8:11
rather be happy every single day working
8:15
toward that mansion on the marsh even if
8:17
it takes me ten years or even if I never
8:18
actually get there if I am happy every
8:22
single day working on the things I know
8:24
that bring me joy and the stories I know
8:26
that are going to be exciting and like I
8:29
talked about in the first tip if you
8:30
haven't seen those you can find the
8:32
links down below to watch this whole
8:33
series but you know it's your choice
8:35
whether to focus on the things you don't
8:38
have or the things other people have
8:40
that you wish you had and feel negative
8:42
about it or to be grateful for the
8:44
things you have and excited about the
8:46
things you're working toward it's the
8:48
same life you're still sitting here
8:50
and exactly where you're sitting but
8:51
it's a matter of what are you choosing
8:53
to focus on the negative things you
8:54
don't have or the things that you truly
8:57
are blessed and excited to have like I
9:00
could be sitting here in this townhouse
9:02
and thinking you know it sucks that
9:04
we're renting and we didn't get to buy a
9:05
brand-new house and I really wish that
9:07
we lived closer to my son's school or
9:10
yeah you know and it doesn't make it's
9:12
no fair that somebody else who's been
9:13
only writing for three years is making
9:15
more money than I am and I've never hit
9:17
the USA Today and Amazon's got this
9:19
kayuu thing and it's affecting my income
9:21
and I could just sit here and wallow in
9:23
all the things that are wrong with my
9:26
current situation like all the things
9:27
that are not perfect happy amazing life
9:30
or you know I could sit here and
9:32
complain about it and I would feel bad I
9:34
would feel tired I wouldn't want to
9:36
write and you know I would spend the
9:38
next how many years of my life being
9:39
miserable well moving into that mansion
9:42
on the marsh even if I did hit that
9:44
level wouldn't make me suddenly happy
9:46
and I know that from experience not
9:48
because I have the mansion but because I
9:50
hit that similar level of income and it
9:54
didn't make me happy or I could sit here
9:56
in exactly the same position exactly the
9:58
same life and think oh my gosh how lucky
10:01
were we even though we didn't get to buy
10:03
a house when we first moved here how
10:05
lucky were we to find a house like this
10:07
with all these windows and a marsh view
10:09
and we can drive two miles to the beach
10:11
and how lucky am I to have this office
10:14
all to myself like wow that is just such
10:17
a huge thing I've never had an office
10:18
all to myself in my life and this is a
10:21
big big deal for me how lucky am I to be
10:25
able to buy the planner that I really
10:26
want to buy to have this amazing son
10:29
that I absolutely love that we tried you
10:32
know just about every infertility
10:33
treatment in the book to bring into our
10:36
lives how lucky and blessed am I to have
10:38
him how great is it to have a husband
10:41
who doesn't have to work because I can
10:43
provide for our family and he can follow
10:45
his dreams yes I can be upset about what
10:48
you know Amazon has done to Kindle
10:50
unlimited or I can choose instead to be
10:53
incredibly grateful for some of the
10:55
other vendors that have really been
10:57
there for me you know when Amazon has
11:00
kind of changed the game over there with
11:02
their exclusivity program like oh my
11:04
gosh thank goodness for you know the
11:06
great people at Cobo that have these
11:08
amazing promotional opportunities thank
11:10
goodness for some of the new reps at
11:12
Barnes & Noble who are working so hard
11:13
to make the platform better thank God
11:16
for my Google reps who are just
11:18
incredibly kind and they're working hard
11:21
to make their store better thank God for
11:23
my Apple Books team that is always
11:25
supportive of me and who you know sent
11:27
me an email when I hit number one and
11:29
paranormal last week it's my choice you
11:31
know I could sit here and I could
11:32
complain sure about the problems in the
11:34
industry or the things that are
11:36
challenges but what would be the point
11:37
how does that move me forward toward
11:40
anything that's going to bring me joy it
11:42
doesn't all it does is make me complain
11:44
one of the main reasons that I stopped
11:47
teaching elementary school when I got
11:49
out of graduate school I had a master's
11:51
degree in Opera if you can believe it
11:52
and instead of following you know my
11:55
dream of being an opera singer at the
11:57
time which I realized was not really
11:58
something I wanted to do I started
12:01
teaching elementary school music and one
12:03
of the reasons that that became such a
12:05
dangerous job for me was that even
12:07
though I loved teaching music every time
12:09
I walked into the teachers lounge in
12:11
that particular school all anybody did
12:13
was complain all the time complain about
12:16
the principal complain about the
12:17
students and how there's no support from
12:19
parents and complain about the
12:20
curriculum and how they've got to teach
12:22
the tests and you know it was like it
12:24
was literally like every time you would
12:26
walk into a group of other teachers and
12:29
I'm not speaking for every teacher I'm
12:30
just talking about the community that I
12:31
was in they were great great people but
12:33
I just realized that it became almost
12:35
like the social norm to just sit and
12:37
wallow in all the things that were wrong
12:39
with our lives and I was so incredibly
12:43
unhappy and you know I allowed that to
12:46
happen in my life well I'm not going to
12:48
allow that to happen again
12:49
in my life as an author because I am
12:53
doing something that I truly love to do
12:56
and I'm going to be grateful for that
12:58
every day and yes there are going to be
13:00
hardships there going to be things there
13:02
are things every single day about this
13:04
business that are driving me crazy that
13:06
are frustrating that are difficult that
13:08
I wish I could wrap my head around that
13:09
I wish I could do better but instead of
13:12
focusing on the negative I choose to
13:14
focus
13:15
joy I truly choose to focus on the
13:19
things that bring me happiness the
13:20
things that move me forward instead of
13:22
walking into the you know teacher's
13:25
lounge of indie authors like instead of
13:27
walking into the Facebook groups full of
13:29
indie authors and just allowing myself
13:30
to get wrapped up in the complaining
13:32
about Kindle and this and that and why
13:34
did they do this and readers this and
13:36
instead of allowing that into my
13:38
existence I have just stepped away from
13:40
groups like that because it is so much
13:42
more important to my mental health and
13:44
to my joy as a human being to instead
13:48
focus on the solutions yes Kindle
13:50
unlimited has affected my income as an
13:52
author who is outside of their
13:54
exclusivity program but instead of
13:56
sitting around complaining about how
13:58
that has changed instead I've been
13:59
focusing on how can I increase my
14:02
readership that other vendors like Kobo
14:05
and Barnes and Noble and Google Play how
14:07
can I focus more on my readership at
14:10
Apple which now I'm selling more books
14:12
at Apple every month than I ever did at
14:13
Amazon so how can I you know be grateful
14:16
for that what's exciting about that
14:18
what new series can I start thinking
14:21
about when I'm done writing these five
14:23
series you know I've talked about this
14:25
throughout this whole entire eight part
14:27
series that I started the year writing
14:28
five series all at once well I am happy
14:31
to say that I have cleared out two of
14:33
those series and I'm currently working
14:34
on finishing the final book in a third
14:36
series so as soon as 2019 hits I'll have
14:39
two series going only and that is a huge
14:41
accomplishment I can choose to be upset
14:44
about my income dropping last year and
14:46
all these problems in the industry or I
14:49
can choose to be totally excited about
14:51
the fact that I accomplished this huge
14:54
thing of finishing out three series this
14:56
year and writing more books than I ever
14:57
have before
14:58
and that I'm proud of those books and
15:00
that I've really made connections with
15:01
my fans and you have that choice in your
15:04
life too you can focus on the negative
15:06
and the things you don't have and the
15:08
things that people have done or the the
15:10
choices vendors have made or the
15:11
hardships that you have in your life and
15:13
you can be miserable and you can strive
15:16
and you can focus on the business side
15:17
of things and tell yourself excuses like
15:20
well I have to write this trendy genre
15:23
that I hate because there's no other way
15:24
to make money you are fully free to tell
15:27
yourself that lie if you want
15:29
or you can decide that you are going to
15:33
be happy and grateful for what you have
15:35
and you're going to find a way to make
15:38
money and be happy writing what you're
15:39
writing and whatever that looks like for
15:42
you is going to be a very individual
15:44
thing in terms of what you want to write
15:46
what you're willing to write what turns
15:47
you on what lights you up but the more
15:51
you can focus on your own joy your own
15:54
positive mindset your own motivation and
15:56
excitement I guarantee you the more
15:58
successful you are going to be that may
16:00
not always translate into a mansion on
16:03
the marsh or a million dollars but I can
16:05
guarantee you that over the long-term of
16:08
your career you are going to be
16:09
massively more successful than if you
16:13
focused on the negative and the things
16:14
you didn't have because I can tell you
16:17
from my own personal experience that
16:20
there is no level no house no car no you
16:26
know twenty thirty forty thousand dollar
16:28
level of income that is going to just
16:30
magically make you happy if you're not
16:33
happy inside I highly encourage you to
16:37
work on focusing on the joy of this
16:40
career the joy of the writing the things
16:42
that you love to write and find that
16:44
balance between good business sense
16:46
coming up with strategy that works but
16:49
also writing the kinds of books that you
16:52
truly love if you want to hear more on
16:54
that I do have a video about should you
16:58
write for love or money that just barely
17:00
touches on this topic but there is a way
17:04
to write what you love and make money
17:07
doing it you don't have to just
17:09
completely cut your heart out of your
17:11
art to be a successful indie publisher I
17:14
hear you know I went to rwi conference
17:16
this summer and so many people said well
17:18
I would love to write young adult
17:20
fiction but everyone tells me you can't
17:22
make money writing young adult but that
17:23
that's not true me amy patrick the those
17:27
of us on my why a panel we are all
17:29
six-figure authors writing young adult
17:32
fiction it is possible to write what you
17:34
truly love so don't listen to people who
17:37
actively discourage you from following
17:40
your dreams there is a way for you
17:42
to be joyful all during this path no
17:46
matter what hardships may come your way
17:47
so I hope that you will take this to
17:50
heart and truly focus on joy in your
17:52
indie career look at it this way guys
17:54
like seriously if you think about all
17:57
the different jobs that you could get in
17:59
your life yes one of the great things
18:01
about being a self-published author or
18:03
an entrepreneur at all is that there is
18:05
no ceiling so you could literally double
18:07
your income you could make six figures
18:09
there's no limit to what you can achieve
18:11
but it's very difficult there's a huge
18:15
learning curve there is so much of
18:17
ourselves that we put into this and
18:18
especially as authors because it's not
18:21
like we're just creating courses or
18:23
we're just creating like you know
18:25
nonfiction things that can just we can
18:27
follow checklists and all these things
18:29
or like showing up to coach people or
18:31
whatever what we're doing is authors is
18:33
we're literally creating worlds we're
18:35
creating characters out of thin air
18:37
we're pouring our heart and soul we're
18:39
learning an art and we are pouring
18:41
ourselves into it and it can take months
18:43
if not years to come up with a story
18:45
world or story ideas or plot you know we
18:48
spend so much time on the creative part
18:50
of it then we have all of the business
18:52
on top of it it's not an easy job if you
18:56
were just looking to make money there
18:58
were so there are so many more things
19:01
that you could do with your life then
19:03
take on the challenge of being an indie
19:05
author there are jobs out there where
19:08
people like pay for your insurance and
19:10
give you salary and bonuses and vacation
19:14
days and all of that sort of thing and
19:15
you only have to show up from like 8:00
19:17
to 5:00 and then you get to go home and
19:19
you don't have to work in the evenings
19:20
it's amazing and yes there are limits
19:22
sometimes to what you can earn at jobs
19:24
like that so there is a perk to being an
19:27
indie author that you know you might be
19:29
able to hit six figures or double your
19:31
income or whatever but the sad and you
19:34
know honest truth is that the majority
19:36
of authors a huge majority of authors
19:39
never make a full-time living at this so
19:42
you if you're going to do it and you're
19:44
going to dedicate yourself to trying to
19:47
make it as an author then you should at
19:50
least be writing something that you love
19:53
fulfilling that creative part of
19:55
yourself
19:56
and making yourself joyful if you're
19:59
just in it for the money can't you go
20:01
and find another job that isn't quite
20:03
this hard then you could write on the
20:05
side and just enjoy it as a hobby enjoy
20:08
it us something that didn't like make
20:09
the difference between whether your
20:10
family eats tonight or not
20:12
I'm just saying there are a lot of
20:13
things that you could do as a career
20:15
that could bring in steadier money where
20:18
you would work a lot less hours and it
20:20
would be a lot easier but if you're
20:22
going to write do it for the joy this is
20:25
not a get-rich-quick scheme this is not
20:28
something that you're just going to jump
20:30
into and immediately start making tens
20:32
of thousands of dollars for like 99.999%
20:36
of us it takes years of hard work and
20:38
dedication so if you're going to take
20:41
this risk and climb this mountain you
20:43
should at least be joyful while you're
20:45
doing it right the kinds of books that
20:47
you love but do it in a smart way and
20:49
like I said if you guys want to see more
20:51
videos on what I mean by that like
20:53
writing to market being that you're
20:56
writing the most marketable thing that
20:58
you love to write and not like just
21:01
writing to trends or writing something
21:03
that you don't enjoy thinking that
21:04
you're gonna make money really fast then
21:07
let me know down below and I'll be happy
21:09
to give you guys some more videos on
21:11
that but if you're gonna do this very
21:14
difficult job instead of choosing a job
21:16
that comes with insurance and bonus and
21:18
vacation days then at least do it with
21:20
joy all right guys that is the end of
21:23
our eight part series I sincerely hope
21:26
that some of these tips have resonated
21:28
with you continue to learn be good to
21:30
your fans stop comparing yourself to
21:32
other and really work on your mindset
21:34

21:37
love as a writer as an indie published
21:40

0:07
I'm so excited
0:10
[Music]
0:14
hey everybody welcome back to another
0:17
writer reset things good things have
0:19
been going on I didn't have a writer
0:21
reset Vlog last week but I've still been
0:24
working on the writer reset so I'm going
0:26
to update you today on everything that's
0:28
been going on let me tell you my entire
0:31
energy is shifting
0:33
I can't even explain how great the
0:37
results are of just taking care of
0:40
myself cleaning up my surroundings
0:42
getting better sleep like there's just
0:45
so much that has been good but also
0:47
really just letting myself get back into
0:50
the fun and joy of creating and really
0:54
getting back to this feeling of like I
0:56
get to do this rather than I have to do
0:58
this or people are waiting or I'm behind
1:00
or it's too delayed or the sales aren't
1:02
going the way I want just letting all
1:04
that other stuff go and say oh my gosh I
1:07
get to do this for a living and how fun
1:10
is this story going to be to tell how
1:12
fun is it going to be to see what people
1:14
think of it and all the twists and turns
1:16
that are in it like what a privilege and
1:19
an exciting job and task I have to be a
1:23
writer who gets to tell the kinds of
1:25
stories that I love the most twists and
1:27
turns things you never sell coming like
1:30
I love it all the characters the drama
1:32
The Angst the coming of age of it the
1:36
self-redemption like oh my gosh I just
1:38
love it so much and I'm so excited that
1:41
I get the opportunity to live this life
1:43
and to have this job and I can feel my
1:45
energy shifting so today I am hoping to
1:50
finish my rough draft so let me update
1:52
you kind of on how that has been going
Draft Updates
1:56
okay first of all I'm just going to kind
1:58
of show this from afar because there are
2:00
many spoilers on this page but one of
2:03
the things well I guess I can show you
2:04
and then I'll just pour it one of the
2:06
things that I have been working on is
2:08
going back through the original and
2:11
creating an outline and thinking through
2:13
the scenes that need to be rearranged
2:15
and one of the things I needed to do was
2:16
create a past timeline and so I have
2:20
basically gone through Page Flags each
2:23
color represents a different character
2:25
and I've gone through the order of
2:26
events exactly as they happened in the
2:29
past which is something I hadn't done I
2:31
had been writing them sort of out of
2:32
order so then I have also written them
2:34
in slightly more detail over here on my
2:38
Post-It notes that are also color coded
2:41
so I have not yet added those to the
2:45
board but I know several people have
2:46
asked me like why do you write things
2:48
multiple times what's the difference
2:50
between what you write in your
2:52
your plotting notebook versus your
2:54
sticky notes versus your index cards so
2:57
I will do a more dedicated video on that
3:00
but the long and short of it is the
3:02
quick answer is
3:03
in my journal there's often just
3:07
brainstorming and thoughts because I
3:08
have more room to think long term but on
3:12
the page Flags I'm really just writing
3:14
argument with Vanessa or uh you know XYZ
3:18
just like a very brief three-word
3:20
overview of what happened on the Post-it
3:23
notes I'm actually writing a little bit
3:25
more about the character development and
3:27
what's actually happening in this story
3:29
as or in the scene as it relates to the
3:32
overarching story on the I have stuff on
3:36
my floor uh on the index cards I'm
3:39
writing all of the things here so it's
3:42
even broader overview goal conflict and
3:45
then the outcome and if you haven't seen
3:48
my series here on YouTube about how to
3:51
write scenes I have I think five videos
3:54
in that series and one of them I go
3:56
specifically over how I create my note
3:58
cards and you can actually find this
3:59
note card outline in plotter so if
4:02
you've never used plotter it's basically
4:04
like taking this plotting wall but
4:07
having it digitally and I have played
4:10
around with it a lot but I haven't
4:11
actually like put or imported an entire
4:13
story into there
4:15
but I do plan to do that for my next
4:18
book and I'm going to share that with
4:19
you guys as well but if you're
4:20
interested they have that scene card
4:22
template in there plus lots of other
4:24
plotting templates so why do I write
4:26
things down three to four separate times
4:28
Well in some ways it's a focus tool for
4:32
me it's a way for me to say okay I have
4:34
written this down multiple times and
4:36
every time I write it down I think of a
4:38
new aspect of that scene so at first it
4:40
starts out as Vanessa has an argument
4:42
with Finn but then I write it down on my
4:45
Post-It note and I think okay what's
4:46
really happening in this argument what
4:47
are the details and so I'm able to sort
4:50
of focus in and then get more well
4:53
really it's it's starting with a broader
4:56
view of it and then I focus in a little
4:58
bit more on the details and then a lot
5:00
more on the details in the index cards
5:01
so that by the time I'm ready to
5:03
actually write the scene I've thought
5:05
through it multiple times and in
5:07
multiple ways and just for me that works
5:10
for a lot of people that would be like
5:11
Overkill way too much just write the
5:13
scene but for me it gives gives me that
5:15
time to really think through what's the
5:17
purpose of the scene what's the conflict
5:19
what's the conversation going to be
5:20
about and every time I like put it onto
5:23
a page like this or put it up on the
5:25
wall my brain is working through another
5:27
aspect of that puzzle and I find it
My Plan
5:30
extremely helpful during the writing
5:33
retreat in April I wrote about 7 000
5:36
words so according to that I still had
5:39
uh let's see somewhere around 20 000
5:43
words to go in my manuscript since then
5:47
I have written an additional 8 000 Words
5:49
which should put me at about 12 000 that
5:52
I need however some of the scenes as I'm
5:55
working through my note cards have
5:57
become apparent that I'm not going to be
5:59
able to properly write that scene in
6:01
full until I know exactly what's
6:06
happening at the beginning so that I can
6:07
have these plants and reveals and things
6:09
that come full circle and so I don't
6:11
really want to go ahead and write it
6:13
when I know the whole scene is going to
6:15
change so instead of writing the full
6:17
about 12K that I have left I am going to
6:20
skip over three important jeans and I'm
6:23
going to write the climax of the book
6:25
like the big reveal and Discovery part
6:28
which also will likely need to change a
6:30
little bit but I think I have enough to
6:32
write a good attempt at it and then the
6:35
resolution which I would also like to
6:37
get to so I have three big scenes to
6:39
write today one is a flashback scene and
6:41
the other two are in the present and I
6:44
think it's going to be about five to six
6:47
thousand words so I'm not gonna pressure
6:48
myself or say it's a failure or anything
6:51
like that be hard on myself if I don't
6:53
completely finish it today but I am also
6:55
kind of determined to get it done and
6:58
I'm excited so I think it will flow
6:59
pretty easily so my plan is I am about
7:02
to pack up my bag and I'm gonna go to
7:05
Panera because it always helps me when
7:07
I'm
7:08
um kind of looking for that motivation
7:11
and feeling excited to just go out and
7:13
in fact this entire timeline that I
7:15
showed you guys I did all of that last
7:17
night we had George and I had a date
7:19
night and he was like maybe we could go
7:22
see Guardian the Galaxy or we could go
7:24
out to eat like in a town several towns
7:26
away and I was like you know what would
7:28
be really great can we just hop around
7:30
different coffee shops and restaurants
7:32
here in our town and work on my story
7:36
and we can talk through it and so we had
7:38
such a blast because it reminds me of
7:40
when I was like before we had kids and
7:44
we were just going to coffee shops or
7:46
places to sit all the time and we would
7:48
talk through story and how exciting it
7:50
was and then we would come home from you
7:52
know the coffee shop and we would play
7:54
EverQuest to until two in the morning
7:56
and then go to sleep and wake up and
7:57
repeat that and sometimes I think part
8:00
of the writer reset and getting back to
8:01
Joy is reclaiming some of what you found
8:06
magical and fun about the process when
8:08
you first began and I know that we can't
8:11
always go back in time like I would
8:12
never trade my kids and our lifestyle
8:14
for you know the world like I miss
8:17
playing Everquest 2 and MMOs but I can
8:20
still do that you'll be in school we can
8:22
have a little bit more of that time and
8:23
I actually said to George with Evie
8:25
going to school in August we'll be able
8:27
to just come out to a coffee shop
8:28
anytime we want and I'm so grateful that
8:32
neither one of us has to go to a normal
8:34
job and so if you are out there and
8:37
you're not in that place yet but you
8:38
dream of having the freedom to do this
8:42
don't give up on your dreams like it is
8:44
possible I started with nothing less
8:47
than nothing my I started from a house
8:49
fire having lost literally everything I
8:51
had uh to building this up from the
Reset Updates
8:55
ground up so don't give up on yourself
8:57
your dreams are possible I promise you
9:00
[Music]
9:02
before I head out I will also say I have
9:06
made significant improvements to my
9:07
writer reset in terms of organizing as
9:10
well I still do have a few things on the
9:12
floor here I have some light bars and I
9:15
want I'm gonna actually put RGB lighting
9:17
around the crown molding in this entire
9:19
room which I have nicknamed Venom so if
9:22
you are a sacrifice me Shadow Demons
9:24
reader if you know you know if not don't
9:27
worry about it but if you read my books
9:29
you would understand that reference but
9:31
I haven't organized the top of this yet
9:33
nor have I put any a kind of shelving
9:36
here but I did have this black
9:41
shade installed and I somewhere in this
9:45
room have see
9:48
um I have a little uh remote control
9:52
where I can either set it to halfway
9:54
point or I can bring it all the way down
9:57
and it is a full blackout curtain which
9:59
is really nice so I'm not going to pull
10:01
it down now because then we'll have no
10:03
light for our video but that is really
10:05
nice and it'll allow me it allows me to
10:07
block out when the sun is really bright
10:08
in here then I also have completely
10:12
organized this closet which started out
10:15
as a complete disaster of a mess I have
10:18
most of my kind of witchy sort of things
10:21
organized over here so I have candles
10:23
and my tarot cards and I have all of my
10:27
crystals and some of my Essential Oils
10:29
and things like that here then I have
10:32
all of my stationery and like painting
10:35
supplies extra sticky notes extra pins I
10:39
am going to hang some of these things up
10:41
here just to make it a little bit more
10:43
aesthetic and eventually I'm gonna get
10:45
like coordinating bins to put up here so
10:49
that looks a little nicer but overall I
10:52
think this turned out great and it's
10:54
very usable I will not keep this stuff
10:56
on the floor long term so that I can
10:58
actually get in here it's pretty slim a
11:00
little area but it feels really good I
11:04
can close the door but when I open it it
11:07
just looks really great and I'm really
11:10
happy with how this turned out I also
11:12
have spent quite a bit of time working
11:14
on this front space here it's not
11:17
completely cleaned out but because I had
11:20
all of the stuff that I organized in
11:22
that closet out here it has been kind of
11:24
a mess for a long time so I just have
11:27
these are all empty and they're going to
11:28
go away today these are empty they're
11:31
gonna go away we have one set of shelves
11:34
that need to be hung over in our coffee
11:36
bar area and then I have some picture
11:38
frames to fill but I did also kind of go
11:41
through and organize this room just a
11:43
little bit like tidied it up and so
11:45
everything is feeling really good and
11:47
when I walk in to the house I just feel
11:51
so much lighter because it's more clean
11:54
we have a few little things there that
11:57
we're kind of dealing with but it's it's
12:00
progress not Perfection I have also been
12:02
organizing this space in my bathroom and
12:05
in my closet so this has been looking
12:09
much better and it's much more like
12:12
organized and handled so just the
12:14
organizing in the house where everything
12:16
is a little bit easier to access to find
12:19
has been game changer for my creativity
12:22
in addition to the organizing I have
12:25
also been eating well I have been taking
12:28
care of my health a little better I have
12:30
been getting better nutrition taking my
12:33
supplements for PCOS I have just been
12:36
out active outdoors in the garden things
12:39
like that a lot more and it's really
12:41
helping my mental health quite a bit
12:43
I also have been getting into the idea
12:46
of using a game board strategy for my
12:49
entire life changes as well as for my
12:51
book releases and everything else and I
12:53
talk about this in publish and thrive in
12:55
terms of a game board strategy but the
12:57
basic idea is that you know the steps
13:00
you're going to take you know what the
13:02
board looks like but you just don't have
13:04
necessarily A Time attached to all of it
13:07
you just know that this completing this
13:10
action triggers the next action like
13:12
you're moving your little piece onto the
13:14
next square of the board and so that's
13:17
part of what I've been doing with my
13:19
writer reset is I have written in my
13:21
notebook the steps I want to take so I
13:24
knew
13:25
from past experience that if I tried to
13:29
wake up early do an amazing morning
13:31
routine cut out sugar eat you know take
13:34
all my supplements go outside for a walk
13:36
get 10 000 steps like if I set that is
13:38
my goal from day one I was not going to
13:41
be able to achieve all that and I
13:42
probably would set into a negative
13:44
spiral of like this is too much it's
13:46
overwhelming and so I know I want to
13:48
make those changes and I want to
13:50
eventually get to that and sometimes
13:51
it's difficult because it's like I want
13:53
to get to that as fast as possible
13:55
because I know it's going to feel good
13:56
but I have to take it one step at a time
13:59
so I kind of decided once I get my meal
14:03
planning and I'm starting to actually
14:05
follow through with what I said I was
14:07
gonna eat when I have you know
14:09
sufficiently started feeling better from
14:13
some of the inflammation issues and
14:15
other things like that like when I hit
14:16
this certain Milestone I will begin a
14:20
little bit more of a morning routine and
14:21
instead of being like I'm gonna go from
14:23
waking up at 7am to waking up at 5 a.m
14:26
I'm doing something a little bit more
14:27
realistic and I'm saying instead of 7am
14:31
I'm getting up at 6 45 and no excuses
14:35
when the alarm goes off I'm out of bed I
14:38
wash my face and that sort of starts to
14:41
wake me up so face with cold water brush
14:43
my teeth and then I am immediately like
14:47
I'm laying out my workout clothes and
14:50
this is it's kind of funny because I'm
14:53
not actually doing a full workout but I
14:55
know that if I can get into that habit
14:57
of getting into my workout clothes than
14:58
when I am doing a full workout it'll
15:00
just be routine so
15:03
out of bed make the bed wash my face uh
15:07
get into the workout clothes head to the
15:10
treadmill and immediately walk one lap
15:14
so it's not a huge amount it's literally
15:17
taking me like six minutes right now I'm
15:19
working on I'm at a three and a half
15:21
incline walking at a 2.7 and it takes me
15:25
about five minutes six minutes to walk a
15:27
lap and then I'm gonna sit down I sit
15:31
and been sitting down this is only day
15:32
three
15:33
to do literally like two minutes of
15:36
meditation and breathing and then I'm
15:38
finishing getting Andrew ready for
15:40
school so it's just a baby like micro
Let’s Write
15:44
piece of a successful morning routine
15:47
but I cannot even explain to you how
15:49
much it has been helping my mental
15:51
health and my energy to have gotten that
15:53
established
15:55
um like what nourishes my body what
15:58
supplements I know I need to be taking
15:59
so that like getting my health in order
16:01
from what I'm putting into my body and
16:03
then also now adding on just a little
16:05
bit of movement and nothing like intense
16:09
but a little bit of movement and
16:10
meditation in the morning has already
16:12
felt so good this week so long long
16:16
explanations of kind of how that other
16:17
writer reset stuff is going George and I
16:19
have been building a kind of Gothic
16:21
castle in Minecraft so that play time
16:24
Evie is on the server with us Andrew's
16:26
on the server with us and that family
16:28
gaming time every night has been helping
16:30
I've finished another book in The Wheel
16:32
of Time on to the next book things are
16:35
really going great and I'm hoping
16:37
today's the day I'm going to finish this
16:39
book which will just be icing on the
16:41
cake so let's go
16:43
[Music]
16:52
one two three
16:56
four
16:58
you only make you feel like you could
17:01
never leave
17:05
[Music]
17:06
and make your dreams come true
17:10
[Music]
17:18
[Music]
17:31
[Music]
17:38
[Music]
17:45
[Music]
18:05
fall in love and tear it down soon as we
18:08
wake up I promise you the world tonight
18:12
[Music]
I Did It!
18:18
so I may or may not have just been kind
18:21
of tearing up in Panera and I didn't
18:22
even record
18:24
finishing it because I was like I'm
18:26
gonna look like a crazy fool
18:29
sitting in here crying in Panera
18:32
did you really finish a rough draft if
18:34
you didn't cry in Panera
18:39
journey to get back to this place of
18:41
being able to finish a story and I know
18:43
that it's just a rough draft but I don't
18:46
want to belittle what I have just done I
18:49
know it's still there's still work to be
18:51
done the edits are still there there's
18:53
scenes that I skipped there's a lot of
18:55
work that has to get done
18:57
but I wrote the ending I wrote the final
18:59
I wrote four scenes today
19:03
just shy of 80 000 words so I wrote just
19:06
shy of 6 000 words today
19:10
in like four hours
19:14
I gotta go pick up my son from school
19:16
but I did it and that last scene was so
19:19
gratifying because
19:20
I have seen it in my head
19:24
for four years I have seen that moment
19:28
and I won't spoil it for those of you
19:30
that actually want to read this book
19:32
which I hope is all of you
19:36
ah
19:38
but just seeing it for myself that
19:42
that moment that I have seen in my head
19:44
that conclusion that resolution and
19:47
really this the first ever Standalone
19:50
novel Standalone mystery I've ever
19:51
written I wrote a book called Deep Dark
19:53
Secrets that I'm going to be rewriting
19:55
to be a standalone it probably should
19:57
have always been a standalone uh it that
20:00
is more similar to this one because it's
20:03
a parent like a paranormal mystery but
20:07
this is my first ever like Standalone
20:10
mystery and
20:12
I'm hoping it's gonna be full of twists
20:14
you never see coming and shocking
20:16
moments and emotion and hopefully you'll
20:19
cry at the end of it because it's very
20:20
touching and I just
20:23
I can't believe I did it there's no
20:25
nanowrimo there's no extra anything that
20:28
led to this moment is just
20:30
not giving up on myself making a
20:33
commitment to follow through to not
20:37
beat myself up to get back to the place
20:39
of Joy where I can create from a place
20:41
of this is fun and I get to do this
20:44
rather than
20:46
I'm behind him beating myself up so if
20:48
you've been looking for that Joy I hope
20:49
this
20:51
is a sign to get back to your own
20:53
writing
20:54
I'm gonna try not to literally just turn
20:57
this off and keep sobbing
20:59
I'm gonna go get my son I'm gonna go
21:01
celebrate a little bit I'm gonna jump up
21:02
and down when I get home and just give
21:04
George a big hug for his help in helping
21:07
me figure out some of the plot and some
21:09
of the details and then my next step is
21:11
really
21:13
I am going to
21:15
get back to
21:18
the scene cards you know putting all
21:21
that uh timeline stuff up on the board
21:23
getting back to the scene cards going
21:25
back through the outline and the rough
21:27
draft that I have printed I'll print out
21:29
the rest of it that I've written and
21:31
start making more detailed notes and
21:33
changes and I'll start the editing
21:34
process so I will carry you guys with me
21:37
through the beginning of editing The
21:39
Disappearance of Vanessa Shaw this will
21:42
likely be multiple rounds of edits and I
21:45
will show you my Approach To those edits
21:47
as we move on
21:49
ah thank you for celebrating with me
21:51
because I know some of you out there are
21:53
I will celebrate you every time you
21:55
finish a rough draft too it feels so
21:57
stinking good and I'm very happy in this
21:59
moment
22:00
emotional and happy and so excited for
22:03
what the future brings because if I can
22:05
do this that means I can still write
22:07
again there have been multiple moments
22:09
in the last year to year and a half
22:11
where I've thought what if I just don't
22:13
have it anymore what if I just can't
22:14
ever write another book
22:17
and
22:20
I can I can I just needed to find my joy
22:25
again
22:26
so here's to Joy
22:28
both mine and yours I'm sending you all
22:30
the good writing Vibes and I will see
22:32
you guys
hey everybody welcome back to heart breathings today I am going to go over some of my absolute favorite things from
0:07

0:12

0:18
wanted to kind of give you guys an idea of some of my favorite things some amazing gift ideas if you've got writers
0:24

0:30

0:37
their hugest biggest sale of the year so if you've been thinking about Erin Condren this is the time to grab some stuff so
0:44
I'm gonna give you lots of ideas I'm going to cover everything from the planners to the bags to the accessories so let's get started so I want to start
Black Friday Sale
0:51
this video looking at some of the bags especially some of their newer bags which I have to tell you are luxurious
0:57
and they're beautiful so another quick thing if you are watching this when it
1:02
first comes out it's Black Friday which means they are having currently they're 30 percent off sale which is the biggest
1:07
sale of the year and it's literally everything on the site is 30 percent off if you have any gift cards or you have
1:13
any other type of coupon codes like 20% off or whatever they because you had a previous order that does stack from what
1:20

1:33

1:40

1:46

1:51

1:57
there's going to be as many links to products like this as I can get together
2:02
for you and get this video out quickly so that if you're shopping for Black Friday and looking for some amazing
2:07
gifts especially for writers that you can go ahead and grab those when the discounts are so good
2:12
right so I'm gonna start with some of the bags and this one is not going to do justice looking top-down so I'm going to
2:19
show you guys some just more like live action shots but this is their tote bag
2:24
it is absolutely beautiful this is the metallic suede and they just sent this to me I've been using it for a few days
2:31
and it is incredible you guys this has so much space in it to fit pretty much
2:37
everything you want it has beautiful zippers that really are working well I haven't even taken the paper out of this
2:42
side but you can actually fit your entire planner inside of this so you can
2:48
fit the whole planner down in there so if it was like raining or something you didn't want it to get messed up you can absolutely fit your planner into
2:55
the side pockets or you can fit them right down in here you can also fit your laptop and it has these pull handles
3:01
here but it also has crossbody strap now I got the metallic suede crossbody body
3:07
strap that matches the bag but there are several different and they just released some new ones maybe like six or more
3:15
straps that you can choose and you can mix and match the straps which i think is so cool there's a few other colors
3:20
that I want to get they also just recently released a smaller version of this tote so if you're not a fan of a
3:26
really big tote but you still want something that you can carry your planner around in or your laptop in the
3:32
smaller tote might be good for you but let me pop in a picture of how this looks on the body I can't even tell you
3:37
honestly how much I enjoy the way this feels on my body I wasn't so sure because I don't always love crossbody
3:43
tight bags because sometimes they can just feel really heavy or you know kind of hurt my shoulders this bag does not
3:49
do that and it's so nice here on the like the material itself that it's made
Clutch
3:55
out of is not so stiff that it doesn't curve to your body which I absolutely
4:00
love makes it so much more pleasant to carry around because it kind of like molds to your body when you are carrying
4:08
it and I love it I think it's one of the best bags I've ever carried and I don't say that lightly because I am a bad
4:15
person so those bags come in the leather and they also come in some different
4:20
like canvas styles and colors so check those out on the website I'll link to them down below they
4:26
also have this brand-new clutch which comes in this metallic suede leather and just a black leather and this is
4:32
basically a clutch that you could just carry around with you or you can you know like you could use it like a wallet
4:37
or whatever and on the inside the zipper comes all the way across you've got slots for your cards to go
4:44
and then you have a space for your phone I have a brand new phone I have the new Samsung Note 10 plus and it does
4:49
actually fit in the pouch like it's wide enough but my phone is too tall so I
4:56
could probably zip it but it's going to really like be a tight fit so if I were
5:02
carrying my phone in this I would probably just lay it down in the bottom and I would put something else in here like my earbuds or something like that
5:08
so this is a really nice clutch it feels really good in the hand so this is a beautiful clutch I absolutely love it
5:14
and I think that you know this would be beautiful if you were going to a party even and you had like a really nice dress to wear but it's also going to be
5:21
nice to slip into the bag and just pull out when you only want to like grab your cards or your wallet so another thing
5:27
that I just have gotten in is the matching laptop sleeve now I was dying
5:32
to get this in from the minute I found out they even had it and again this comes in the black leather and this
5:38
metallic suede I don't know how well that's showing up on video but guys this is so beautiful I love this and it
5:44
actually really photographs nicely but this laptop sleeve again like the clutch comes open on two different sides it
5:51
doesn't have like a lot of padding like some laptop sleeves will have but it does have these three little pouches
5:58
here so you could easily like slide a pin down in one side maybe some sticky
6:04
notes or a little notebook if you were going out writing and I think this is like one of my top like gifts for
6:11
writers if you're going to look for something that you can ask for for Christmas or that you are really wanting
6:17
for your birthday or whatever if you're a writer or if you have a writer that you want to buy something for but this
6:23
is the Samsung Chromebook pro I think it is I've had this for a few years just the pro or the plus I know that people
6:30
always ask about these laptop covers this comes from decal girl because I always put my book cover of the book I'm
6:35
currently working on on my laptop but this is just a kind of a stain 13 inch sized laptop and it fits
6:42
perfectly inside the laptop sleeve and there's a little bit of space there on each side so it's gonna fit a lot of
6:49
laptops really easily maybe if you had like a 17 inch it's not going to fit in here but this is nice and it's a really
6:55
slim profile and it'll just slide right into the bigger bag I really have to say
7:00
this is stunning in person and I'm excited about keeping my laptop in this and carrying it out with me and this
7:07
really has enough little space here that instead of carrying my big bag I could use this kind of like a clutch I feel
7:13
like you know putting the laptop in and having a you know like a $10 bill and my
7:18
ID and a little pin here in a notebook and you could even really slide another
7:25
notebook or pad in here so I'm going to talk about these in a minute but these are just some of their notepads so
7:31
there's plenty of room to put this in here or another notebook and zip it up and then you can just carry this kind of
7:37
like a clutch and you wouldn't need to even carry a bigger bag which I love so I'm excited about that because a lot of
7:43
laptop sleeves don't have enough space it's like just enough to put your laptop in and you can't really fit anything
7:49
else in so this would be one of my top of my wishlist things as a writer but
7:54
it's great for any entrepreneur or anybody who takes their laptop out with them to work so since we're on the
Bags
8:01
subject of bags let's just quickly talk about some of the other bags that erin condren has so this is their accordion
8:07
style like pin holder and I love this one because you can honestly fit so much
8:13
it's very slim if you want to carry it like this but if you travel a lot with your planner supplies but washi tape in
8:20
one some rulers and other tools like whiteout in one a bunch of pins and another and so on and this was a great
8:26
one and this is actually pretty inexpensive and it's really colorful which I like I really like the gold zippers too they also have kind of
8:33
larger pin pouches on their site this one I've had for a few years so I don't even know if this exact one is still
8:38
available but if they do have some like this it's faux leather but it feels really nice and it's enough to carry
8:44
like all of my note cards which is a lot of note cards for my novel and it's big
8:49
enough that it'll carry these like tombow dual brush pens really easily so if you like carrying
8:55
markers because you're going to color code or whatever this carries a lot of stuff some more of their type pouches
9:01
they have these planning pouches that will go over the front of your planner and they come in lots of different
9:07
colors and stuff like that so this is their kaleidoscope one and you can just put it the elastic band right over your
9:15
planner so that you can lay it on your desk that way or if you're going to go out and work on it it not only holds
9:20
your planner closed inside your bag so the pages don't get messed up but it also is a great place to store some of
9:27
your pins so if you like say some of these dual brush pens or your markers or
9:32
you want to slide a couple sheets of stickers in here you can carry that stuff right along with you without
9:37
having to carry you know a bigger bag like this if you don't want to and I also have this one that is just the teal
9:44
colored one and I have it over a notebook because it will also slip over their doctorate or softcover notebooks
9:50
really easily so since we're talking about bags these are really inexpensive but I highly recommend them these are
Reusable
9:58
their reusable bag I always keep these in my diaper bag with you know taking
10:04
the baby around everywhere with me I carry these in my diaper bag I have like three or four of them and you can just
10:10
roll them up and then it's got this little elastic here that you can put
10:16
over the top of the bag so that it holds closed fold it up and put it in your bag like this so you could carry this in
10:22
your laptop bag you could carry it in your purse your baby bag it'll hold wet clothes but it also hold groceries so I
10:28
have like three or four of these inside my bag because I would always forget to bring reusable bags when I was shopping
10:35
now everywhere I go have these bags with me and then I don't have to get they're like plastic bags I've had this for more
10:41
than a year and it's showing absolutely no sign of wear so this might technically be considered an accessory
Planner Folio
10:47
but I'm going to cover under bags because it is kind of like a bag for your planner so these are their planner
10:54
folio and I have been through all of the different iterations of these types of folios with erin condren and i love them
11:01
the current version of them is the best version they've ever had and I really love them they come in the
11:06
classic size but you can also get them in the larger size so I have a couple of those to show you so there's tons of
11:13
different designs you can get the design of the folio to match your actual
11:18
planner if you want now you can also choose the color of your zipper so you can see I've got a gold one here I've
11:24
got a silver one here I think they also have rose gold so these I love and let me just show you real quick kind of how
11:30
they look inside so when you open these up got padding in it and then it also
11:36
has this top piece where you can fit a small notebook one of their petite
11:42
planners usually will fit in here it also has a place that you could fit maybe some post-it notes or some
11:47
stickers a couple of pins erase are lots of little tools that you can carry with your planner and again with this you
11:54
have the super added bonus of you know nothing about your actual planner is going to get messed up if you're carrying it in your backpack or your
12:00
other bags then the planner just slips into this little spot behind but this is
12:06
easy to slip inside of the planner folio
12:11
and it's protected and then a zips really easily even if you have another notebook or a pin or anything in here
12:18
and so the small one is pretty much exactly the same just on a smaller scale
12:24
so it doesn't have the extra pin loops it just has the one pin loop and it's you know exactly the same style there
12:31
next we're going to cover the planners themselves so one of my absolute favorite products from Erin Condren is
12:38
the deluxe monthly planner I talk about it a lot and I absolutely love it and it
12:43
has the monthly spread then it has notes pages so this is not a weekly planner
12:49
it's just a monthly planner but it has all these great notes pages and you can see like on my October 1 I used this to
12:56
plan out my writing schedule and my like a newsletter stuff some of my shadow
13:01
demons events anything that has to do with my writing career like my schedule my social media all of these ideas go
13:09
into this planner then at the very end of the monthly part of the planner it is just a notebook so the first set of
13:16
pages are going to be lined pages but you can actually add I believe up to sixty extra pages and they can be just
13:23
lined like the beginning of the notebook or they can be doc grid and I think you can also get them to be task pages which
13:29
I'll show you what that is in a minute so I absolutely love this planner it comes with stickers in the back and it
13:35
also has a folder in the back that you could stick extra stickers or things like that in it and of course this was
13:40
last year's design the woven wonder design but but I have another already
13:46
purchased another deluxe monthly planner for the same purpose in the new design
13:51
the kaleidoscope design for next year which looks the same except it has an additional planning spread so it's got
13:57
this spread with the dot grid and then it has like spot for birthday and goals so I probably won't use this for
14:02
birthdays for a deluxe monthly like editorial calendar I'll probably use it for planning out my blog posts or the
14:08
videos that I'm going to do for that so same thing it has all of that so in the back you've got all the extra notes
14:14
pages and I add as many as I could which I think like I said was 60 extra pages
14:19
because I just don't want to run out and this year I'll be using it all the way through the year then it comes with
14:25
stickers and again the folder in the back so this is really one of my favorite products from Erin Condren and
14:32
you can customize the coil so last year I got a black coil this year I'm getting you going to be using a gold coil you
14:38
can customize the cover you can add charms to it you can change the covers out I absolutely love it it comes in the
14:45
colorful version which is what I got last year or the neutral version it also comes in this large size so you've got
Large Planner
14:53
the classic size planner but you can also get the large size planner so this
14:58
is what I've been using for my heart breathing's editorial calendar you can totally customize the cover to match the
15:04
season so this is one of their Christmas covers that I love and I was able to customize the colors of it to kind of
15:09
match my heart breathings branding can see I've used this a lot so I put a growth tracker in the front I put my
15:16
editorial calendar with some of the customized stickers from Erin Condren and then I can plan out all my video
15:21
content I keep track of how many videos I've done things for my newsletter I like having the bigger planner for my
15:30
heart breathing's for my youtube channel because I just have a lot more going on I like to outline my videos and have this sitting
15:36
in front of me when I'm doing the videos and that kind of thing so I do use this pretty much on a daily basis then in the
15:42
back I've purchased some of these extra they have dividers that you can add to
15:47
these planners so I've purchased this where I can put separate types of things like I think I've shown you guys before
15:54
this last one is for courses and I ran a course you know created a course this
15:59
summer called publish and thrive which is a course about self-publishing and I did all of my outlines for the videos
16:05
and everything which there are more than 100 videos all went into this one location you can't beat the paper
16:10
quality on these Erin Condren the paper is really nice it doesn't like none of your stuff goes through and it's just
16:17
really a pleasure to write on and it comes with some beautiful stickers and then I actually added some extra
Life Planner
16:22
stickers that they sell in the shop then in the back just like always it has this pocket and then the back cover
16:29
so deluxe monthly planner is one of my favorite planners from Erin Condren then
16:35
of course their flagship planner is the life planner and I have several of these
16:42
as well and I have use them for different purposes so their regular life planner you can get it in eighteen months which is what this one was
16:48
because I got at mid year or you can get it in the twelve months and comes in the colorful or the neutral
16:53
style and then some of the other options that you have are you can get it in the
17:00
vertical layout or the horizontal layout or the hourly layout so I'll just show
17:06
you real quick I'm using this one as a memory planner but this is what the colorful vertical looks like so the
17:13
vertical has the three boxes with a little bit of note section down at the bottom some notes here on the side and
17:19
every year they kind of tweak the design a little bit and truthfully this is one of my favorite designs they've ever done
17:24
I love the colors these tabs are absolutely beautiful then there's a notes page at the end which is true for
17:30
all the planners and then it has this dash board at the beginning of every month so you get the monthly layout and
17:35
then the weekly layout in the vertical and again you have the choice of coil between black gold platinum which is a
17:42
silver color and rose gold so this is the vertical layout now the life
17:49
planners this year are also coming with this box that's a storage box and I really like this feature because if
Storage Box
17:55
instead of just having to like put the coils on your bookcase or wherever you are storing it you can actually store
18:01
them in these boxes which are going to line up much better on your bookcase when you're storing old versions of it
18:07
which I like this year all of the planners come with the storage box a
18:13
hexagon box label that you can put on the edge to like mark what year it was gift labels complimentary cards and then
18:19
a 20% off your next purchase coupon that comes inside this little package they're also beautifully packaged with tissue
18:25
paper and this is a newer one that I just got with the new 2020 removable
18:31
cover it comes with the ruler and this is the neutral horizontal so just to
18:38
show you the separate type so you've got the dash board layout you've got the monthly planner layout and then you've
18:44
got the horizontal so this is what the horizontal looks like that you have you know the dates some lines here and then
18:51
boxes on the side that you could use for a variety of different purposes when I was using this as a pregnancy memory
18:57
keeper I would kind of journal what was happening throughout the day and then I would add a picture or something like
19:03
that over here a lot of people will put stickers or checklists over here so it depends like if you go back and you look
19:09
at my planner 101 series on how to choose the perfect planner for you that video will help hopefully help you
19:14
decide whether you need an hourly a vertical or horizontal and it gives you some ideas of how to use those different
19:20
types so this is again just a beautiful planner it just depends on which way you
19:26
want to plan but they all have the same quality of paper some notes pages in the
19:31
back some dot grid pages oops some coloring pages and a contact page with
19:40
this pretty hexagon page and then the same things that I just showed you in the last planner with the stickers the
19:45
future planning and the folder so they all come with that it's just a matter of
19:50
which layout do you prefer so this is the horizontal layout I don't actually have an example of the hourly layout
Hourly Planner
19:59
in the actual coiled Planner but I do have the hourly layout in this beautiful new soft bound planner now if you're
20:05
looking for something that's just gonna look really pretty and professional on your desk this is so beautiful this is
20:11
their kind of rose gold pattern and it's very similar to the setup of the coiled
20:18
planner but it's just bound differently so instead of the coil if like riding
20:23
near the coil bothers you then it's gonna be really nice to have this like bound planner and it really lays pretty
20:29
flat so you don't have to mess with it too much and it's really you know same
20:35
quality of paper and everything else so you've got the dashboard again you've
20:40
got the monthly view and you've got more space in this planner because it's bigger so you can see if you were to
20:47
compare the two monthly spreads here the boxes are bigger if you're looking for a
20:53
little bit more space which i think would be nice and the hourly planner so their hourly planner goes from 6 a.m. to
20:59
9 p.m. with some extra lines down here at the bottom and if you if you need the hourly but you don't want the space to
21:06
be too small then you could get this and you could split it into half hours as well like if you have a lot to track on
21:11
an hourly planner so that is what the hourly layout looks like in the back
21:17
here you just have some notes pages and the future planning page and then that's the end of the planner but this is a
21:24
gorgeous planner you can get it in several different colors and I believe several different layouts so I'll link
21:29
to the different types of life planners down below but this is another good choice for you okay so the final type of
OnTheGo Folio
21:36
planning system that they have at Erin Condren that I love and I've been using more and more is their on-the-go folio
21:43
now this is kind of a traveler's notebook style system the folio itself comes in multiple colors so it comes in
21:50
like green and blue and one that has a starry sky kind of thing it comes in one that has florals on it this one is just
21:57
embossed with the Erin Condren flower and this is called blush I believe and I've got one of their planner charms on
22:03
here which I love and then inside because it's like the travelers notebook system whether you're familiar with this
22:09
or not it has these bands so like rubber bands four of them and you can open up your planner to the middle
22:16
of the planner and put it on these bands so that you can carry up to four notebook you can customize it to be like
22:22
you want because you can choose which ones of their petit planners you can put in here and they're just continuing to
22:28
add more and more so you could just put in a lined notebook that is just
22:34
something you want to journal in but they also have lots of different types of petit planners and I can't go over
22:39
all of them for time sake but the ones that I'm using are the Wellness log this one is the happiness blooms from within
22:46
is their self-care journal then I've been using this pretty much on a daily basis their gratitude journal which I
22:52
absolutely love it gives you space every day to kind of journal about what you're grateful for and then they have these
22:59
daily planners so if you're really interested in a daily planner you can get it in on-the-go folio system and
23:05
what this entails is quarterly system so it carries three months in each one it
23:11
has the monthly view and then it has a daily page every single day of the week except for Saturday and Sunday are split
23:19
onto one page but it carries you through three months and then in the back it has
23:25
a set of stickers because almost all of the petit planners come with stickers that kind of match the foil and the
23:32
different types of coloring and things like that of the planner that you chose so I've been using those stickers a lot
23:39
you can see in the gratitude journal but every single one has its own set of
23:45
stickers that kind of match the design and then one of the other accessories that I love that I'll talk about in a
23:51
minute are you can buy these pouches to go on the back where you can add in extra stickers and things to this
23:58
on-the-go folio I love this system and I love how customizable it is they continue to add different kinds of these
Petit Planners
24:04
petit planners so keep checking back this is one that we got in the summer surprise box is the summer journal I'll
24:10
probably use that next year because it just didn't get a chance I was too busy this year they have journals that are docked grid so if you want a bullet
24:17
journal inside your on-the-go folio you can use these and they come in different colors this one is just lined pages if
24:23
you wanted to just use it like a journal and then something new that they're coming out with that came out in their recent
24:29
seasonal surprise box is a weekly intentions and goals which is kind of a goal-setting planner and reflections to
24:35
help you hit your goal so this just is the tip of the iceberg so if you're looking for a really cool sort of
24:43
traveler's notebook or customizable system then erin condren petit planners inside the on-the-go folio is a really
24:51
great customizable system okay we're gonna move on to what I would just call their accessories so we're gonna start
Notebooks
24:58
with the notebooks and they have lots of different kinds and sizes of notebooks but these are my favorites so this is
25:04
their softcover notebook it comes in a lot of different colors which I would love to have more and more of them so I
25:10
can line them up on a bookshelf because they're so pretty has kind of a shimmer enos to it and you can customize them
25:16
with your name and you can get them in like dot grid or line and these are just
25:22
really nice notebooks I haven't used this one yet I have one that's their hardcover note but consider this kind of
25:27
soft flexible one that I put tabs on and I used this summer to help me outline
25:32
some videos but these are nice and like I said those planning packs do fit right
25:38
on the top of these then they also have coiled notebooks that are the same beautiful paper and the same really
Coil Notebooks
25:44
quality coil and removable exchangeable covers that you have on the planners
25:49
themselves so I love these my only complaint about these notebooks is that
25:55
I think they're a little bit expensive for the amount of pages that you get I think that for this size of coil they
26:01
could probably add another 20 pages or at least give you the option to add more pages to it because they're you know
26:08
they're pricey because they're really good quality but I would just would like more pages in them but you do get a
26:13
choice this is their task layout here where you've got a place to put all your
26:18
notes and then you've got kind of a checklist to-do list over here so you could outline a project and then you
26:24
could put your checklist over here on the side to make sure that you've got everything done so that's this style
26:31
they also have just dot grid style that you can get or just regular lines
26:38
notebook pages so again you can get this classic side this the same size as their
26:44
classic planner which is cool because if you get a notebook with a new cover on it like this was one a design that my
26:50
husband had commissioned for me for heart breathing's and I turned it into a
26:57
planner cover and I use it on this notebook but if I wanted to I could take this off and put it on my actual planner
27:04
for the month as well so it you can interchange these with the actual planner cover so that's kind of cool
27:09
then they also have this larger size which is the same as the large deluxe monthly planner or basically an
27:15
eight-and-a-half by 11 size sheet and again you can choose the task size which
27:21
is what I have here with the task list on the side so these are perforated pages so you could easily tear these out
27:27
as well so you've got just the pages with the really nice paper and then
27:32
there's also stickers in the back so that you can use these these are kind of like Paige flag style and you can use
27:40
them to mark things inside your notebook so I love that it comes with the stickers too so really nice quality but
27:47
Erin Condren if you're listening give us a little bit more pages inside these for the for the price so those are the
Notepads
27:53
notebooks they also have notepads so you can get them in two packs and they come
27:59
in I think three different sizes I tend to buy the largest size I like to have these sitting on my desk when I'm like
28:06
writing out ideas or something comes to me I also sometimes carry these with me now they do have this sort of 3m thing
28:13
on the back so if you wanted to you could attach them to the back of a planner or inside another notebook you
28:18
could also hang them up on the wall that kind of thing so you've got these that are customizable in terms of the colors
28:25
that you want and you can also put like a monogram or your name at the bottom then I have another one in a different
28:31
color to show you and again this is that same Mohawk paper that's just really nice quality paper which I love writing
28:37
on it's really smooth paper then they also have these types of task pads that actually have lines and I think you can
28:44
also get this in dot grid and you can get these customized with some of the same designs as the planner covers and
28:50
you can get your full name so these are kind of two different types of notepads that they have but they all have this
28:55
little 3m on the back so for example if I wanted to with this size which it matches up pretty well with their
29:01
classic planner I could take these 3m off and I could attach it here to the
29:07
very back of the planner and that way I always have an extra little notebook there in the back so this size could
29:13
easily go into the larger size planners more accessories you've got this box
29:19
that fits some of their sticker sheets really well I'll show you an example here I have a lot of they're like
29:24
smaller sticker sheets in this so you could use it for sticker storage or also
29:30
if you order some of the stationery if you want to send out note cards they
29:36
have some that fold over or they have these that are more kind of like postcard style but they do come with pretty envelopes as well you can even
29:42
buy matching address labels which i think is pretty cool but if you order some of the customized note cards they
29:48
come in this cool storage box that has a magnetic closure so that's all the
29:53
notepads and notebooks that I'm going to cover some of the other accessories that I love did you guys know that erin
Clipboards
29:59
condren has clipboards I only have two but I would like to get more because I really want to create a station in my
30:06
office that's like a wall of clipboards that have different checklists and things on them I think that would be kind of a cool productivity idea and
30:13
this one you can customize with your colors it has a little circle here that
30:19
if you put like a nail or something on the wall you could hang them up and it's a really sturdy clip also you can you
30:27
know you can choose your colors choose the design to match your planner or your favorite aesthetic this one comes with
30:33
the name on the bottom or on the back this older one that I got several years ago is able to put my name on the front
30:39
just to show you kind of the size this is just regular printer paper so when
30:44
you put it into the clipboard the night your name is down at the bottom because these are really nice long clipboards so
30:51
even when you have paper in them it doesn't cover up or obscure the entire design it just leaves you a little bit
30:58
on the sides and then you've got this nice part down at the bottom so you can still kind of see the color and these are I guess acrylic but they're really
31:05
nice quality I've had this one for many years and it's showing almost no signs of wear and
31:11
like I said I would love to get a whole station of these together so another great accessory if you didn't know these
31:17
are great for writers I use my clipboards pretty much almost every day since I already briefly
Covers
31:22
mentioned this I'm also going to tell you that one of my favorite features of Erin Condren planners is that you can
31:29
switch out these covers and I love that you can switch them out with the notebooks that you buy so if you buy
31:34
notebooks and get a new cover you can switch that out with the cover you're using on your planner but there are so
31:40
many different designs and they come out with seasonal designs and you know designs that you can customize your
31:45
colorway so I could have gotten these red cherries and a black background you know there's just lots of ways that you
31:50
can customize it for yourself and they're pretty inexpensive especially with a 30% off deal you could go in and
31:56
buy like 10 different covers for your planner for next year and switch it out almost every month so lots of really
32:02
cool design ideas that you can do for that here's just an example of some of the ones that I have for the classic
32:08
size and I've been kind of collecting these for years at this point and I love
32:14
the fact that when you just are ready for something like its spring so now I'm going to use this one this is one of the
32:20
oldest ones that I think I have just some really cool sayings some really beautiful designs here's one that would
32:27
be great for you know fall or for Halloween time don't quit your day dreams so like really good sayings and
32:33
of course I'm not sure where the front cover to that one is sometimes when you buy they're seasonal surprise box it
32:39
will come with exclusive covers that you can't usually buy in the store that have like gold foiling but they won't you
32:44
won't have it customized but that's another cool thing about their seasonal surprise balloons but once you've been
32:50
using Erin Condren for a while and some of the notebooks and the planner you start to potentially build up a really
32:55
nice collection of covers and I love that you can pull them off and reuse them which is something unique to I
33:01
think to a high-end planner so for example like I showed you earlier this is one of their new snowflake designs
Planner charms
33:07
and I was able to customize the colors with the different colors of pink and now it's kind of a snowy look to the
33:13
planner while I'm here and I have it on display another accessory that you can
33:18
buy in the store are these Planner charms so they have these little planner charms that you can
33:24
get with initials on it so this one says s for Sarah this one was said that says love to plan
33:30
was a special EC insider gift for when they launched the planner so I don't think you can buy that in the store but
33:36
you can buy these little drusy charms that come in different colors so this is obviously the blue one the white one
33:42
there's a black one you saw the pink one on my on the go folio so these work really well on like straps for the
33:49
on-the-go folio but you can also attach them to your coil and it can be very pretty like that so they have lots of
33:55
different planner terms which i think is a really cool addition this year moving on to more of like desk accessories they
Desk accessories
34:03
have this beautiful acrylic ruler that I'll put against a white piece of paper so you can see the different colors but
34:08
it's like their monthly Erin Condren colors and I love that you can see through this ruler because if you're trying to you know mark something on a
34:16
page you can see where it is in relation to everything else so I really love a clear ruler and it's really nice and
34:23
thick acrylic but it also makes for a beautiful desk accessory so that's one of my favorite additions this year
34:28
they've also started adding more of these push pins which I'm using
34:33
currently all over my giant bulletin board so I love the different colors of
34:38
push pins they also have beautiful desk accessories like this gold stapler that says make it happen and a gold tape
34:45
dispenser I love having these on my desk they just make it look really classy and really beautiful some of the desk
34:51
accessories I don't have are some like magazine folders and pin cups and things
34:56
like that so I'll hopefully be adding those to my Erin Condren desk collection pretty soon another beautiful desk
35:02
accessory that's probably if I had to say like my ultimate favorite desk accessory I've ever owned is this
35:08
hourglass and they actually have a set of three that will measure three different sets of times I think it's 10
35:13
20 and 30 minutes but you can correct me in the comments if I'm wrong this is the 20 minute one and I bought it
35:19
individually and it has this beautiful teal sand in it and it is measures 20
35:25
minutes now of course it doesn't have a little clock that goes off or a timer that goes off but I love to write in
35:30
sprints and to work in sprints 20 minutes is kind of a sweet spot for me so I love being able to just turn
35:36
this over and not have to use my phone or the internet or anything else to mark
35:42
the time because if I have my timer set on my phone a lot of times I'm going to get distracted by social media or other
35:48
notifications so I can actually leave my phone in a totally different room and use this to measure my twenty minutes
35:55
the other thing I love about it of course is that it just makes a beautiful desk accessory so it's pretty and
36:01
functional more products that I'm just trying out actually are the gold page
Page markers
36:07
markers they have more of these types of pushpins I think they have some that come in rose gold these palm tree ones
36:13
are gold and I can't wait to put these up on my bulletin board for next year and this beautiful set is actually set
36:20
of magnets and I have their wall organization I'm going to show you in a minute and I'm going to put some of
36:25
these magnets on it I'm excited to give them a try but they're just really pretty magnets so if you're looking for
36:31
gifts for a writer or what to ask for for yourself then you know some of these
36:36
things that are inexpensive but really kind of classy like these little page markers is a really good idea because
36:42
30% off right now for Black Friday is going to put these really inexpensive and they're very cute little accessories
36:50
for your planner so you can see how nicely that just clips on to your
36:56
planner and now it's just a little pop of gold there on your planner page and you can easily find where you were so
37:02
this would be nice to use either in your planner itself you could use it in any kind of document that you have you could
37:09
also use it in your notebooks and that kind of thing so they have lots of different types and styles of these page
37:14
flags and I just think they're really pretty it's a little bit of a luxury to have a gold page marker but I love it
37:19
Erin Condren has so much more than just planners they have all of these cool accessories and I'm obsessed with them
37:25
and also they have a deal where if you buy I think it's four or more accessories you get 15% off so I would
37:32
definitely go right now and check to see if that stacks with the current 30% off or not because if it does that's gonna
37:37
be a crazy deal I'm not sure if it does or not something else Erin Condren has added over the course of the past year
Gel pens
37:43
are gel pens so they've got sets of pens that look like this or my favorite
37:49
are their dual tip colored markers so they come in you can get them in this kind of set that has multi colors like
37:57
some of the more basic colors you can also get a set that's like just the purples or just the blues or just the
38:02
pinks so you can kind of go in and mix and match and choose they also have lots of bundles and things like that but
38:07
basically this is a dual tip marker so on one side it has a medium sort of marker tip to it that is great for
38:15
coloring but also for color coding in your planner and then they also have a fine tip that you can see like this it's
38:21
kind of more like a felt tip type pin and it's much finer tip and I use these
38:27
all the time to color code to write plot notes if you are a writer and you love to color code your like characters and
38:35
your scenes and your edits and stuff like that these are the perfect kind of markers i have pretty much every color i
38:41
think that they have in these dual tip markers and i highly recommend to them now if you do go in and you like where
38:48
to color in really hard in your planner it might start to bleed through so I
38:54
would not like use it to really color things in really dark but when it comes
38:59
to just writing on the main planner page I can show you just real quick if I just write out a word here in this and like I
39:06
were to make a header out of it or something like that then you can see on the other side that there's a tiny bit
39:12
of ghosting but for a heavy marker there's no bleed through at all then if you want to see the fine tip which I use
39:21
more often than I do the other tip there's bear you can barely even see it through the page which I love but like I
39:28
said if you were to like color in really heavy with it you're gonna probably see
39:33
it I don't know if it will actually lead through but you can definitely see it a little bit more and actually I'm surprised that didn't bleed through
39:39
so just goes to show you how nice this Mohawk paper is but a lot of other
39:45
planners that I've found if you try to actually use markers in the planner it's going to bleed through or it's going to
39:50
go so bad that you can't even use the opposite page so that's one of the things I love about the Erin Condren
39:55
brand is just they really pay attention to the paper quality and that's why I keep coming back to them so
40:02
yeah the markers are a really good deal now the gel pens i will say i typically
40:07
love gel pens but i find these to be a little bit scratchy and they don't write super smooth so I wouldn't highly
40:13
recommend the gel pens unless you don't mind like fine tip pens that are a little bit Scratchy I also wish the colors were a little bit
40:20
more like dark or saturated so overall i was a little bit disappointed in the
40:25
quality of the gel pens they don't feel like high end in my hand they're a little bit too thin and I think the
40:32
colors are too muted so hopefully they'll keep working on the gel pen quality because that's one of my things
40:38
I would not recommend from Erin Condren there are so many other types of accessories and these actually would
40:43
make good props too for Instagram photos and things like that so you've got like rose gold palm trees another functional
40:52
thing that you can get at Erin Condren our stencil sets if you see here you've got a couple of different types of
40:58
stencils this one has a lot of more like bullet journaling headers which I love you could also draw in a monthly boxes
41:05
check boxes you could really use this with bullet journaling this one I'm not going to be able to show you as well
41:10
because of the fact that it's clear but it has some of the like mid-century circles and airplane some weather icons
41:19
hearts and other types of banners so these are very inexpensive and trust me with 30 percent off they're going to be
41:26
almost nothing so if you like to use stencils which I do and I talked about in planning on a budget so you don't
41:31
have to keep buying more and more stickers then Erin Condren has a couple of really cute ones that are small
41:37
enough to fit into the pockets in your planner I talked about this with the on-the-go folio so I won't really talk
41:43
about it too much more but they have these adhesive corner pockets this is the large one but they also make a
41:48
smaller one that work really well inside either inside a journal inside a notebook or on the inside of those
41:54
on-the-go folios because they don't have pockets in them you can adhere these down and they don't come up easily so
42:01
they're going to really hold in on that on-the-go folio and you can really put your stickers into it so speaking of
Stickers
42:07
stickers we're almost to the end of some of my favorite things from Erin Condren one of the things I personally love to
42:13
do an author is they have these customizable stickers now this is time-consuming I'm not going to lie but
42:20
it's so worth it for me I just love to be able to use these in my planner and now they do have rectangular stickers that you can customize to with people's
42:27
faces so you could put birthdays in but they have these sticker ones and for some reason I just love this and I like
42:32
to go in and upload my book covers and then I use this in my planner when I'm doing promotions so you can see I use
42:39
these quite a bit and I get all my different book covers on them they also have a variety of monthly adhesive tabs
42:46
and I mentioned to you guys that you can use these on the on-the-go folios if you
42:51
want to or you can use them inside the notebooks too like the life planner itself oops the life planner itself
42:58
already has monthly tabs but some of their other things like the on-the-go folio the quarterly one and stuff like
43:05
that they don't have these in it so you can buy these either in multiple color like multi color or just the plain black
43:11
with gold they also have packs of date dots that you can use to either read a an old planner I talked about this again
43:18
on my budgeting planner video that just came out so you can use these and they
43:23
come in a variety of different colors too you know date and undated planner you could use it to make check lists if
43:29
you want it instead of dates you can use it to read a an old planner there's lots of uses for these date dots you can also
43:34
just use it to add a pop of color to your planner they also have them not only in the multi colors but the
43:40
metallic ones so they've got rose gold gold and platinum metallic date dots then they have those same round dots
43:47
with asterisks and with planes that come in a lot of different colors that you
43:52
know they're not dates they're just the circles so you could use that to make check lists inside your like horizontal planner you could use it to make certain
44:00
types of events stand out and that sort of thing so lots of stickers and like I mentioned usually when you buy for you
44:07
get a discount of 15% off all accessories that you put in your cart so I like to buy several sets of stickers
44:14
all at once because they're not very expensive but they're super useful Erin Condren also has lots of different
44:19
sticker books and I love their sticker books they have like quotes on their stickers a lot of ones that are
44:26
you know foiled and page flags they're very useful some of them are quotes and
44:32
they have like a clear backing some of them are half boxes quarter boxes even
44:38
like bottom washi that you can use in the planner and they've got lots of different colors they are monthly one
44:43
has like a special sticker set for January February March and so on just tons of tons of options now what I
44:49
did was something that I saw from Gen Ross a pretty neat living which is I
44:55
bought these it's maybe like a six by eight photo album and then cut the
45:00
stickers out of the sticker books and put them all in these sleeves so that I can have all of my sticker books in one
45:07
place if these are still available I will link to them down below I got them on Amazon so before we go there's just
45:12
one final thing I want to show you which is their new wall organization system and it is totally customizable and I'll
45:19
just give you an idea of what it looks like on the wall okay so a little bit of Christmas cheer they are for you
Organization System
45:25
but this is their organizational system that they have I'm sorry the lighting is
45:30
not totally great here but we have this on the wall in our living room and you can customize the color and what you
45:37
want this to say you can also customize the board itself I chose the weekly
45:43
layout so that I can put our meal plan and my husband can come in because he's always like what are we doing this week
45:49
and so that way you can see what we're having for dinner you can see if I have any appointments and that sort of thing you can also
45:54
customize what goes along the bottom here so we have this these little knobs that we put our keys on we have a cork
46:02
board here that we can put notes on and then we have the pin Cup where we have all the wet erase markers from Erin
46:08
Condren and then we also have this little spray bottle to be able to spray and wipe off
46:14
the board so that we can start fresh which I'm about to do for next week something else that's really cool about
46:19
this one is this part here actually comes up and it's the board is attached
46:24
to it and you can switch out the board that's on it so if you want to for the
46:30
seasonal time right now they have one that has like snowflakes and different colors on it or if I wanted to switch to
46:36
the monthly overview I could do that so this board definitely pricey but it's super
46:42
customizable and it's very unique for what you can do with it so I'm really glad that I have it we use it every
46:48
single day in our home and it just is a really also a nice piece of decor on the wall so I highly recommend it and
46:55
especially for 30% off it's going to be a much better deal but I'm going to quickly put the magnets on this and see
47:01
how that looks so you guys saw that set of magnets that I got I just went ahead and opened them up and decided I would
47:08
try them on here so they're just tiny little magnets they've got rose gold accent to them in
47:14
different colors this one has gold on it and there's just lots of different
47:19
colors to it so you could actually use this as like because they're round and they fit right in the lines you can use
47:25
them sort of as bullet points to call attention to you know whatever you're writing for the day but also they're
47:31
super strong these are really nice magnets and this board is actually metal it's not just a pure white board which
47:37
actually makes it a little bit harder to get the writing off of it I find then you would normally for a white board so
47:43
I just use alcohol instead of water to get all of the wet erase off of it but
47:49
I'm gonna love these magnets so this would easily hold you know pictures or notes or anything like that but you
47:55
could also like I said use it like as lists or bullet points just to make the board a little bit prettier the magnet
48:02
set itself actually comes with 20 magnets so it's a lot of magnets to choose from so this is their
48:08
organization system which is another new product they've had out this year that I would definitely recommend especially if
48:14
you can get it on sale okay you guys that is a huge haul of all my favorite
Final Thoughts
48:20

49:14

49:48
comment down below and I will see you guys in the next video bye [Music]
0:00
hey everybody welcome back to my channel
0:02
and over the next couple of weeks I am
0:04
going to bring to you a series of videos
0:07
where I will talk about how to build an
0:09
anchor series which is basically just a
0:12
best-selling series but since I'm going
0:14
to be calling it an anchor series I
0:16
would like to explain to you first what
0:18
is an anchor series okay so what is an
0:26
anchor series an anchor series is a well
0:29
branded clearly defined series with five
0:32
or more books that is positioned to
0:36
bring in readers and income to your
0:39
career for years to come this is you
0:43
know if you think about the definition
0:45
of an anchor there are actually a couple
0:47
of definitions that I really like one is
0:49
a person or thing that provides
0:52
stability or confidence in an otherwise
0:55
uncertain situation I love that because
0:58
there is no doubt that indie publishing
1:00
is a very uncertain situation and I love
1:03
the idea of having this anchor something
1:06
that provides stability to your career
1:08
despite everything else that's going on
1:10
because I often like to say that really
1:12
and truly indie publishing is like
1:14
setting your ship out onto the open seas
1:17
where there are shark-infested waters
1:20
there are waves that will blow you you
1:22
know off course that will tip your you
1:25
know completely flip your ship over
1:26
there are so many things like vendors
1:29
change their algorithms they change the
1:31
way they promote your books and things
1:32
happen overnight sometimes in this
1:34
business that can completely shatter
1:36
your income or can you know raise you
1:39
way up there been people whose careers
1:40
have been made off of you know right
1:43
place right time because a vendor made a
1:44
change that you know really did great
1:48
things for them but these are things
1:49
that you can't really predict and
1:51
they're definitely things that you have
1:52
no control over so it is very much like
1:55
being out on the open seas well if you
1:58
build for yourself an anchor series it
2:00
is going to give you a little bit of
2:02
stability actually a lot of stability
2:04
and a lot of confidence over the long
2:07
term this is definitely a long term
2:08
strategy this is not something that is
2:11
like a get-rich-quick kind of
2:13
tip or a hack of any kind this is a
2:15
long-term strategy that I'm talking
2:16
about but it is something that can help
2:18
you bring in income consistent income
2:21
for years to come if not hopefully
2:23
decades another definition of an anchor
2:27
that I wrote down is an object used to
2:29
hold something firmly in place and I
2:31
also like this definition because it's
2:33
like you think about dropping your
2:35
anchor and that you know anchor holds
2:38
you in place that holds you to your
2:39
goals if you remember one of the first
2:41
videos that I did was talking about what
2:43
is it that you want out of your career
2:45
and this is something that I will come
2:46
back to over and over and over again
2:48
because I'm so passionate about really
2:51
you know tailoring your career to being
2:54
something that you can not only be proud
2:55
of but something that's going to be you
2:57
know spiritually profitable for you
2:59
emotionally profitable for you as well
3:02
as financially profitable and until you
3:04
know what it is you want it's hard to
3:06
know what is going to make you feel
3:08
fulfilled you know emotionally and
3:10
financially but once you are on that
3:12
direction instead of letting trends
3:16
competition comparing yourself to other
3:19
people
3:19
vendors changing instead of letting all
3:21
that stuff like send your boat way off
3:24
course this is something that's going to
3:25
hold you firmly in place and help lead
3:28
you towards your goals I really hope I'm
3:29
explaining that well because it is
3:32
really one of the best long-term
3:33
strategies is to build an anchor series
3:36
so just a nother quick you know sort of
3:38
explanation as to what an anchor series
3:40
is it's something that's well branded so
3:44
that when readers see it they
3:45
immediately recognize it as part of the
3:47
same it is something that is in a very
3:49
clearly defined genre or niche market it
3:52
is something that readers can go oh okay
3:54
that is this kind of book I'm not
3:57
talking about copying someone else's
3:59
book but what I am talking about is you
4:01
know people can look at it and go oh
4:02
that's a police procedural that is
4:04
similar to this other thing oh that's an
4:07
urban fantasy with a kick-ass heroine oh
4:09
that is a young adult paranormal book
4:12
about witches something that is very
4:14
clearly defined instead of like you know
4:16
if somebody asked you to describe your
4:17
book and all you were able to say is
4:20
it's like a book about this girl that
4:23
does this and like I'm not sure if
4:26
there's gonna be paranormal in it or if
4:28
I'm gonna do this other thing it's like
4:30
that's not clearly defined and if you if
4:32
you can't put it into a spot in the
4:35
Amazon store or if you don't know where
4:37
it fits in iBooks or in Google Play like
4:39
overarching category then maybe you need
4:42
to get something clearly defined if you
4:44
want to build something that I call an
4:46
anchor series that is gonna bring in
4:47
money and bring in lots of readers for
4:50
years to come it needs to be in a
4:52
clearly defined niche or niche or
4:54
however you say that word it also needs
4:56
to be something that you have focused
4:59
releases on and it needs to have in my
5:01
opinion five or more books so there are
5:04
going to be you know different
5:07
experiences for different people but I
5:09
think the more books you have in an
5:10
anchor series the more likely it is to
5:12
grow over time my anchor series for
5:14
example I just released book 9 there
5:16
will be at least 11 books and they're
5:18
going to be several spin-offs
5:20
so it's something meaty enough that
5:22
readers can get into it and they can
5:23
love it for years to come and they can
5:25
spend days weeks months in this world
5:29
that you've created one or two books
5:31
isn't usually going to be enough to
5:33
build an anchor series so these are
5:35
basically the elements of an anchor
5:37
series hopefully get an idea of what I'm
5:39
talking about when I say anchor series
5:41
over the next few weeks I will be doing
5:43
a series of videos on an anchor series
5:46
so we're gonna use the word series a lot
5:48
but I'm gonna be talking about branding
5:51
genre how you choose a genre how you
5:53
research your genre I'm gonna be talking
5:55
about focus releases and what that means
5:58
like speed between releases I'm going to
6:00
be talking about titling and pretty much
6:02
every element that goes into building an
6:05
anchor series so I hope that you will
6:06
stick with me through that through those
6:08
videos and if you have enjoyed this

[Music]

hello writers and welcome back to my
0:01
channel today is the first day of my
0:04
building and anchor series series so
0:08
today we're going to be talking about
0:09
branding so I'm gonna touch base on the
0:16
basics of how to brand an anchor series
0:20
so if you haven't watched my video about
0:23
what an anchor series is then you'll
0:25
want to go back I will link it down
0:26
below and you can listen to what an
0:28
anchor series is and how I use to that
0:30
to sell over half a million books but
0:32
today's video is all about branding that
0:35
series there are so many elements and I
0:37
could probably talk about this forever
0:39
but I am just gonna talk on the basics
0:42
of how to brand so one thing you
0:44
definitely want to think about is your
0:46
titles these do not all have to be like
0:48
the same words I discussed this in one
0:51
of my earlier videos but sometimes like
0:53
having a repeating word or you know
0:57
number of syllables so that things flow
0:59
the same way using song titles something
1:01
that connects the titles together so
1:03
that a reader can easily see that these
1:05
books belong together so for example my
1:08
shadow demon saga series is beautiful
1:11
demons inner demons bitter demons shadow
1:13
demons then when I switched up and
1:16
followed a new story arc I started using
1:18
the word darkness so emerald darkness
1:20
Forgotten darkness beyond the darkness
1:22
the next book is deceiving darkness it's
1:25
not that difficult to come up with
1:27
something that ties these books together
1:30
it doesn't have to be a repeating word
1:31
it can be something that is just similar
1:34
that ties them together so like mine for
1:36
my eternal sorrow series it's deaths
1:39
awakening sorrows gift faith surrender I
1:42
used two similar naming convention in my
1:45
recent willow Harbor series that I'm
1:46
writing with a few other authors it's
1:48
like vampires descent hunters revenge
1:52
witches mark
1:54
Triton's curse so you've got that you
1:57
know just that recurring apostrophe s
1:59
with a you know word at the end I like a
2:02
noun at the end so you've got just
2:04
different ways that you can use the
2:06
titles to show that these books all
2:08
belong together it could also be like a
2:10
song title like
2:12
always on my mind or you're the light of
2:15
my life just look at other how other
2:18
people have done it there are million
2:20
different examples out there just go
2:21
start looking for series in your chosen
2:23
genre and see how other authors have
2:26
used these title naming conventions to
2:29
tie their series together now it doesn't
2:31
have to be that every title is
2:33
completely unique but with the way that
2:37
the world is getting flooded with books
2:39
right now I would recommend that you go
2:41
on to Amazon Google iBooks somewhere and
2:45
where there's a great bookstore with a
2:47
lot of people are using and start
2:49
searching for the title you're thinking
2:51
about using so like if you want it you
2:53
know you were thinking about using the
2:54
word darkness for example like I'm using
2:57
pull up maybe like three different
2:59
things like brainstorm into darkness
3:01
Forgotten darkness hello darkness but go
3:06
in and start searching for those and see
3:08
how many titles pop up so probably for
3:10
something like into darkness there's
3:12
going to be 20 to 100 titles already
3:16
like that now when I started that series
3:18
for my darkness naming convention I used
3:21
the word emerald to darkness because my
3:23
witches use emeralds and I thought it
3:25
would be very unique and if you go on a
3:27
new search for emerald darkness you're
3:29
not going to find a lot of books that
3:31
are titled emerald darkness now if you
3:33
look for beyond the darkness which is my
3:35
more recent one you will see that there
3:37
are lots of books titled beyond the
3:39
darkness but at this point I'm in book 9
3:41
of my series and I feel like it wasn't
3:43
as important to use something completely
3:46
unique however if you want to use a
3:48
naming convention I recommend doing your
3:51
research and going in and making sure
3:53
that there's no one else using exactly
3:54
the same words that you're using or that
3:56
you can come up with enough to last you
3:59
for many many books if you can only come
4:01
up with three things that match and you
4:03
want to write a ten book series you
4:05
would be much better off you know going
4:07
with something different that would be
4:08
easy for you to come up with 10 or more
4:10
titles or however many books you forsee
4:13
writing in the series so that you can
4:15
brand them all the same also you know
4:17
branding doesn't just have to go with
4:19
titles it also has to do with your cover
4:21
art so
4:22
one thing that I will sort of pop in
4:24
here that you guys can see is you know
4:27
some examples of some series that have
4:29
really branded cover art and I'll start
4:31
with my own series so my shadow demon
4:34
saga I have been through several
4:35
iterations of this and I talked about
4:37
that in my how I sold half a million
4:39
books video but every time I've
4:42
optimized that series branding it has
4:44
been very clear that these books belong
4:47
together
4:47
my name is very well branded and
4:50
actually on all of my paranormal books
4:52
my name looks exactly the same it has
4:54
the same sort of I'm using the same font
4:56
it's usually placed in a very similar
4:59
place it's usually the same arrangement
5:00
of letters and so when you look at it
5:04
you can see at a glance that this is a
5:05
Sara Kanin book so I have branded my
5:07
name I have branded the titles all of
5:09
the titles on my cover art for the
5:12
shadow demon saga used the same font and
5:14
this sort of thing is very important
5:16
because you want for readers to the
5:18
second they see that cover to know that
5:20
it belongs to you and to your series so
5:22
that's why it's important to go ahead
5:25
and look at what other books are in your
5:27
genre and make something that fits but
5:30
is not copying because if you're copying
5:32
another author you know they may see it
5:34
and they may think oh that's gonna be a
5:36
Sara Canon book but it's not and then
5:38
they might be disappointed so come up
5:40
with something that brands things
5:42
exactly to you that makes you stand out
5:45
and makes you unique but still fits into
5:47
the branding of that type of genre
5:49
something that looks like it belongs
5:51
where you are putting your books in the
5:53
store also the cover art itself the
5:56
colors the style you wouldn't want to
5:59
put something that was like very iconic
6:01
like a you know think of the Fifty
6:03
Shades of Grey covers you've got these
6:05
items you know like a necktie
6:08
I don't even know what's on the other
6:10
ones but you know it's it's items it's
6:13
not a person on the cover so if you did
6:15
you know necktie on the first one and
6:17
then you put a girl or a couple on the
6:19
second one they're not gonna look as
6:21
branded if you had a great you know this
6:23
gray tone for the first two covers and
6:25
then you switch to red for cover number
6:26
three it's gonna be very jarring so it's
6:29
always better if you can keep the color
6:31
scheme the same keep keep the branding
6:33
the same if you're going with a
6:34
landscape stay with landscape if you're
6:37
going with a couple go with a couple the
6:39
entire time try to keep the covers
6:41
similar but different the more they can
6:44
look like they belong together the more
6:46
it's going to trigger that reaction when
6:48
a reader is looking through you know
6:50
stores and they're seeing just these
6:52
tiny little thumbnails so you want them
6:53
to recognize it from your branding just
6:55
right away you can take your branding a
6:57
step further and even go into like I
6:59
have I spent some money and had Sarah
7:02
Hansen from okay creations create
7:04
branding for my entire website that I
7:06
felt really matched the themes that I
7:09
use in my books of nature small town
7:12
being out in the woods but also witches
7:14
paranormal young adults so it looks more
7:16
you know young adult than it does adult
7:19
I've got purples and teals and
7:20
everything tends to brand well with my
7:23
actual covers and my series so that it
7:26
looks like a cohesive whole and I use
7:29
that branding pretty much everywhere you
7:30
see my name and it just keeps you know
7:34
it just keeps everything nice and tight
7:37
so the more you can brand that and you
7:39
can even take it a step further and say
7:41
the formatting of your books you know if
7:43
you're using a certain kind of font for
7:45
your title of your chapters continue to
7:47
use that so I'll pop in some examples
7:49
here of I've been formatting inside
7:51
vellum which is something you can use on
7:53
a Mac and it is beautiful because you
7:56
can brand all of your books to look
7:59
exactly the same in paperback ebook and
8:01
you can use the same sort of elements to
8:03
make it very much a cohesive whole use
8:05
branding in your metadata use the same
8:07
types of keywords the same like what I'm
8:09
saying metadata I'm talking about like
8:11
your blurb your description your
8:13
keywords and all those things you can
8:15
brand all that really tightly so that
8:17
everything becomes this really neat
8:19
package where it's easy to see this is
8:21
paranormal
8:22
this is why a or this is mystery this is
8:24
very hard-boiled detective and this
8:26
cover looks like it belongs you know in
8:28
the store with all the other detective
8:30
covers I will if you guys are interested
8:33
in seeing it I will also do a video
8:34
about how to blend in how to research
8:37
your category and how to know sort of
8:40
how to fit in with your genre about how
8:41
to stand out at the same time because
8:43
you want to stand out as unique but you
8:46
don't want to stand out as wrong like
8:48
for example you wouldn't want to put
8:50
your own face on the cover of your
8:53
mystery book you would want to put it on
8:56
maybe the cover of your non-fiction
8:58
autobiography but it wouldn't fit on
9:00
your urban fantasy book so you know if
9:03
you have a really great urban famous and
9:05
you have a kick-ass urban fantasy
9:07
heroine and there's very little romance
9:09
you wouldn't want to put like a big
9:11
beefy guy with like his muscle chest and
9:13
stuff but my hands my husband calls him
9:16
like man chest covers that wouldn't fit
9:18
for an urban fantasy it would look great
9:20
in a paranormal shifter romance so
9:22
there's if you guys are interested in
9:24
seeing that I can talk more about how to
9:26
brand your cover art and all of that to
9:29
specific genres and how to research
9:31
those genres and figure out how to fit
9:33
in but for today this is my tip for
9:35
branding you want to make sure the
9:37
titles are branded so that they all seem
9:39
to match each other in terms of you can
9:41
easily see how it's either a repeating
9:44
word or a type of phrase or some other
9:46
type of naming convention the web your
9:50
website can be branded to the type of
9:52
genre that you write your cover art it
9:55
should absolutely be branded because
9:57
this is one of the most important things
9:59
that you can see at a glance that these
10:01
books belong together and you can even
10:03
brand across different series like I
10:05
said all of my paranormal books have my
10:08
tie my name looks the same on all of
10:10
those in terms of font and all my
10:12
contemporary books my name is slightly
10:13
different and in a different font so
10:15
that at a glance my readers can tell
10:18
those books are paranormal or they're
10:20
not paranormal based on how the covers
10:22
look and then also even going into the
10:24
formatting and the way that you write
10:26
your blurbs so I hope this tip has
10:28
helped you with branding and
10:30

10:32

of how to build an anchor series in the
10:45
least to come so I hope you guys stick
10:46
around and in the comments let me know
10:48
which of these branding tips meant the
10:50
most to you and I will talk to you down
10:53
there in the comments that's it for now
10:54
bye

[Music]


hey guys welcome back to my channel
0:01
where we have been discussing how to
0:04
build a best-selling series or what I
0:06
call an anchor series if you are just
0:08
finding this channel I hope that you
0:11
will go back to the beginning of this
0:12
series on how to build a best-selling
0:14
series for yourself I will link the
0:17
playlist down for you below and you can
0:19
follow all the way through today we are
0:21
specifically talking about one of the
0:23
elements of building an anchor series
0:25
which is choosing a clear
0:27
genre okay so choosing it clears onra
0:34
this is a tough one for a lot of us
0:35
because those of us that are multi
0:38
passionate and we like writing about
0:39
lots of different things it's sometimes
0:41
you know we follow our imaginations we
0:44
write what we love we're passionate
0:45
we're artists so we want to be able to
0:47
be free to write what we want how we
0:50
want to write it however there is an
0:52
additional element when you're talking
0:54
about actually packaging and selling
0:55
books and that's you have to find you
0:58
know your readers the new readers have
1:00
to be able to find you and you know
1:02
sometimes the readers just may not know
1:04
that they really want a zombie
1:07
apocalypse story with witches they may
1:09
not realize that and that could be why
1:11
they're not finding you at least I hope
1:13
that's what the problem is with my
1:14
zombie witches series but the other
1:17
problem with that is that it is not a
1:18
clearly defined genre is it horror is it
1:22
post-apocalyptic is it paranormal is it
1:25
young adult who knows I don't even know
1:28
sometimes where I would place that
1:29
series what I'm talking about is my
1:31
eternal sorrow series this is a series I
1:34
launched in 2013 and it is by far the
1:38
lowest sales of any series that I have
1:40
and there are very clear reasons for
1:41
that because it doesn't fit into a clear
1:44
shanwa it's what I would call genre
1:45
mashup and it has elements of lots of
1:48
different things but because I haven't
1:50
found the right way to like package it
1:52
and to place it clearly in the stores it
1:55
just hasn't found its readership now the
1:57
readers that I have that find it love it
2:00
but the problem is they don't know about
2:02
it they don't find it or they read the
2:04
blurb and they're just not that into it
2:06
because it's not a clear niche it's not
2:09
a clear sean roe whereas my best-selling
2:12
series the shadow
2:13
and saga is something that's very clear
2:15
to define it is very coming-of-age young
2:17
adult it is as you know has elements of
2:20
mystery it has elements of romance but
2:22
when I'm marketing it and I'm talking
2:24
about it it is a why a contemporary
2:26
fantasy it is a why a paranormal mystery
2:28
it is very easy when I'm choosing those
2:31
subjects and those categories on Amazon
2:34
or iBooks or Google Play I know exactly
2:36
where to put that book because it fits
2:38
clearly into a genre niche and it
2:41
follows a lot of the expectations of the
2:43
genre when readers are going to pick it
2:45
up so they identify with it they relate
2:48
to it it's what they expected and
2:49
unfortunately reader you know well
2:52
fortunately or unfortunately reader
2:54
expectations are a big part of this
2:56
business
2:56
we can want to be all the you know
2:59
artists that we want to be but if you
3:01
don't meet those reader expectations
3:03
there's going to be some level of
3:04
disappointment sometimes even anger at
3:06
you know hey this isn't at all what I
3:08
was expecting and a lot of people are
3:10
not going to go on to read more books in
3:11
that series because they didn't get what
3:14
they wanted out of your book when
3:16
readers see a package they see a cover
3:18
they see a genre they see a blurb you're
3:21
making a promise to them and you're
3:22
saying this is what this book is it is
3:24
similar to you know I think readers
3:26
naturally are going to relate it to
3:29
something else they've read so for
3:30
example like I would almost say my
3:34
shadow demon saga is similar to the tone
3:38
of like the Vampire Diaries or Pretty
3:41
Little Liars but with witches it's got
3:44
that very teen sort of angst
3:46
coming-of-age type of story and it has
3:48
actually grown over time into something
3:50
even bigger than what those are into
3:52
more of a fantasy style series but I
3:55
digress
3:56
it is very easy to compare it to other
3:59
things even though it has its own unique
4:01
elements and of course it's written in a
4:03
way that no other story is written
4:04
because it is written by me but it still
4:07
has those elements that people are
4:09
expecting let's talk for just a minute
4:12
about you know some other best-selling
4:14
series I talked about Bela aundrea law
4:16
she has the Sullivans series it's a
4:18
family they live I believe in California
4:21
maybe in the vineyard vineyards I
4:23
haven't read all of them but you know
4:25
it's fan
4:25
so when people pick up those books
4:27
they're contemporary romances they have
4:29
a sweet couple on the front you know in
4:31
an embrace or an almost kiss
4:33
they have romantic type of titles
4:35
they're in the contemporary romance
4:37
section of the store so when readers
4:41
pick it up it's a promise that saying
4:42
this is going to be a great love story
4:44
this is going to have conflict between
4:46
these two characters this is going to be
4:48
contemporary so it is not going to have
4:50
witches or speculative elements it is
4:52
going to be exactly what you expect and
4:55
by the end there's going to be a happily
4:56
ever after because that's what romances
4:58
do and when you make that promise to a
5:01
reader you have to deliver on it doesn't
5:03
mean that you're copying someone else's
5:04
story it doesn't mean that you are
5:07
trying to be like anyone else but it
5:09
does mean that you are fulfilling the
5:10
promise that that reader picked it up
5:12
because they wanted to read something
5:14
that made them feel a certain way that
5:16
made them fall in love with these
5:17
characters and that's what they were
5:19
looking for in that moment and if you
5:21
give them something that was not what
5:22
they were expecting they're going to
5:24
have some level of less enjoyment than
5:27
they would otherwise have had now I know
5:29
some of you are probably going but Sarah
5:32
what about George are Martin and a game
5:34
of Thrones where he ends up killing off
5:36
these characters and no one was
5:37
expecting it I mean I know I mean sorry
5:39
spoiler alert if you haven't watched
5:41
Game of Thrones then you know maybe turn
5:43
this off but you know I wasn't expecting
5:46
I had not read the book so when I
5:48
started watching the TV series I was not
5:50
expecting the character that I thought
5:52
was going to be the main character of
5:54
the entire series to be beheaded it was
5:57
just not something that I thought was
5:58
going to happen because as a reader my
6:00
expectation is okay I have identified
6:03
this person even though there's a big
6:05
cast of characters this person is the
6:08
main character so he is going to be my
6:10
hero and follow the hero's journey so
6:12
when he died it was quite a shock but
6:14
the reason I stuck with that is because
6:16
so many of the other elements of that
6:19
series fit you know exactly what I was
6:21
looking for epic fantasy world building
6:24
characterization conflict it had
6:26
everything else so if you are going to
6:29
buck the traditions of the trend in
6:31
which you're writing you've got to have
6:33
the skills to do it so just keep that in
6:35
mind that's kind of a little aside to
6:37
this conversation
6:38
but the idea that I want to get across
6:41
more than anything is if you are going
6:43
to build an anchor series something that
6:46
you want readers to come in love so much
6:49
that they tell other people about it
6:50
love so much that they start talking
6:52
about it that they're sharing it with
6:53
other people and most importantly love
6:56
so much that they pick up the next book
6:57
and the next book in the next book and
6:59
they follow you on Facebook and they
7:00
join your newsletter list and they're
7:02
following you now and they're part of
7:03
your tribe if you want to build that
7:05
with an anchor series you need to make
7:07
sure that the series you are putting all
7:09
your money on all your time on all your
7:12
focus on is something that can clearly
7:15
be defined into a niche or genre that
7:18
you can easily say this is that this is
7:22
horror this is a contemporary romance
7:24
with a small-town element this is a Navy
7:27
SEAL romance this is you know whatever
7:31
it may be your particular genre this is
7:34
an urban fantasy with a kick-ass heroine
7:36
no matter what your genre is it needs to
7:39
be something that's easily defined and
7:41
is actually has its own category at most
7:44
vendors because the if you if you're
7:47
trying to take something like for
7:48
example my zombie apocalypse dystopian
7:51
witches series and you're trying to put
7:53
that in the store it's very difficult to
7:55
know where to place that which means
7:56
it's going to be difficult for readers
7:58
to find a lot of readers are going to
8:00
pick it up not expecting what they get
8:03
and there's just it's just not as strong
8:06
of a series to build upon so my
8:09
suggestion is that you come up with
8:11
whichever of your series you're if
8:13
you're still trying to decide which
8:15
series to create as your anchor series
8:17
choose something that is most easily
8:19
definable the stronger the niche the
8:21
smaller the niche the better so instead
8:23
of just saying contemporary romance I'm
8:25
going to write or instead of just saying
8:27
military romance I'm gonna write Navy
8:28
SEALs instead of just contemporary
8:30
romance I am going to actually write
8:32
bride romances there's going to be a
8:34
bride on the cover there's gonna be a
8:35
wedding at the end engagement you know
8:37
or I'm just gonna write royalty you know
8:40
come up with that that clearly defined a
8:45
niche market if you're gonna write ye
8:46
then write Y a paranormal you just
8:50
whatever you choose
8:51
want to make sure it has a spot on
8:53
Amazon iBooks google play Barnes & Noble
8:55
Kobo you want to make sure there's a
8:57
category for it that you can easily just
8:59
slip your book into and then you want to
9:01
make sure that you're branding your
9:03
titles your metadata so I mean your
9:05
keywords your categories everything
9:07
matches and places it into that very
9:09
clearly defined niche I will go a little
9:11
bit further into this in my next video
9:13
where I will discuss and show you
9:16
actually I'm gonna do a screen share and
9:17
show you exactly how you go on to Amazon
9:19
iBooks and these other vendors and
9:22
actually research and find out what
9:25
categories they have and where you might
9:27
fit in by looking at the other books
9:29
that are in those categories so if you
9:30
have any questions please pop those down
9:32
below and I hope this gives you a nice
9:34
little overview of what it means to have
9:36
a clearly defined niche or clearly
9:38
defined genre and why it's important so

[Music]

hello everybody and welcome back to
0:02
Heart breathing's today we are going to
0:03
talk about something that has been much
0:05
requested every time I do writing
0:07
Sprint's or I go on a writing retreat a
0:09
lot of people email me and ask about
0:11
this so I thought I would cover it today
0:13
which is how to write faster so today
0:23
I'm going to be giving you eight tips on
0:25
how to improve your writing speed but
0:28
before we get into it just one thing
0:30
that I feel like needs to be said right
0:32
now especially in the indie market
0:34
there's a lot of talk about how you have
0:37
to write super fast that everything is
0:39
about like rapid releases and writing
0:41
twelve books a year or you know just
0:44
getting these books out as fast as
0:45
possible and there's a very little
0:46
discussion about writing quality books
0:49
and I don't want to get into a huge
0:51
discussion about it because it's really
0:53
up to you in the end how you best want
0:55
to run your career what quality means to
0:58
you and all that sort of thing so I'm
0:59
not going to make really comments on
1:01
what is quality or not quality but I
1:04
just want to make sure that I make it
1:06
clear that I'm not saying write faster
1:08
because it's the only way you're gonna
1:10
have any kind of career and you should
1:11
give up quality to write as fast as you
1:13
can because that is not at all what I
1:15
believe and I also believe that it can
1:17
be very dangerous to compare yourself to
1:20
other writers this is something I've
1:22
talked about on the channel before
1:23
because it's something that I personally
1:25
have struggled with pretty much you know
1:28
the entire time that I've been
1:29
publishing that it becomes very
1:31
difficult for me to watch other people
1:33
writing ten books a year and to not be
1:36
able to replicate that for myself
1:38
because I just physically cannot write
1:40
ten books a year and have them be at the
1:42
quality that my readers expect or that I
1:44
expect of myself that's not a judgment
1:47
that someone else can't do that because
1:48
I have a lot of friends who are writing
1:50
that many books and they're great books
1:51
but it's just not for me I can't do it
1:55
at least right now with my current skill
1:56
set so in the end you have to let go of
2:00
comparing yourself to other people so
2:02
don't feel that you have to write faster
2:04
just because someone says every sprint I
2:06
write a thousand words you know four per
2:08
sprint that doesn't mean that you should
2:11
be writing a thousand words person
2:13
or that you're not good some people only
2:15
write 200 words per sprint some people
2:18
can only write a thousand words a day
2:20
and that's the best they can do but
2:22
those are great words and they're making
2:24
progress
2:24
some people can consistently write
2:26
10,000 words a day and that's just their
2:28
process when you get caught up in
2:30
comparing yourself to other people and
2:32
thinking that you're not good enough
2:34
just because you're a slower writer or
2:36
because it takes you longer to produce
2:38
the quality that you want to produce you
2:41
really start to get into a toxic
2:42
relationship with yourself and with
2:44
other authors so before I go into the
2:47
tips on how to write faster I just
2:50
wanted to make it clear that I'm not
2:51
saying I think you should be writing
2:53
faster but I think that everybody who's
2:55
an author is constantly working to get
2:57
better at something so if your words are
3:00
coming more slowly than you wish they
3:02
were coming and you want to be able to
3:03
type those words out a little bit faster
3:05
I'm talking about these tips so that you
3:07
can do this for you not so that you can
3:09
do this to compare yourself to someone
3:11
else or to catch up with someone else
3:13
and as you go on your journey toward
3:15
writing faster the only person you
3:17
should be comparing yourself to is
3:18
yourself right now in this moment when I
3:21
first started writing I struggled to
3:24
even write 500 words a day I would sit
3:26
down for hours the words wouldn't come
3:27
very quickly I would be kind of pecking
3:29
through like just choosing every single
3:31
word and I would spend a couple of hours
3:33
and end up with 500 words and that's
3:35
where I started and that was okay now I
3:37
do have days where I can write a lot
3:39
more words than that and I can write a
3:41
lot faster so I'm gonna give you some of
3:42
the tips that helped me to get to this
3:44
point but again I just wanted to make
3:46
that clear that I'm not saying you
3:47
should be writing faster you should
3:49
always be writing at the level that
3:50
makes you comfortable that makes you
3:52
feel that you're producing quality work
3:54
but we're going to talk a little bit
3:56
about that when it comes to the rough
3:58
drafts
3:58
rough draft process as we go so here are
4:01
my eight tips oh and I also wanted to
4:03
just say that I apologize for the boxes
4:06
here in the back but you guys are gonna
4:07
be seeing that a lot because I'm about a
4:08
month away from my big move to a new
4:10
house here in Charleston and as you know
4:13
I'm also six months pregnant so I am
4:16
just going to be putting boxes kind of
4:18
wherever and they'll get moved when they
4:19
get moved so hopefully you guys don't
4:21
mind a few boxes in the shop because
4:23
that's kind of just the best I can do
4:25
right now
4:26
so tip number one is to plan what you're
4:29
writing in advance or visualize your
4:31
scenes in advance so whether you're a
Plan or Visualize Scenes in Advance
4:33
plotter or a pantser which a plotter is
4:36
somebody who plots out a lot of their
4:38
work beforehand a pantser is someone who
4:40
flies by the seat of their pants they
4:42
just sit down and write whatever comes
4:43
to mind
4:44
but whether you're one of those or
4:46
somewhere in between it's very important
4:48
when you sit down to actually write
4:50
those words that you have a pretty good
4:52
idea or a visualization of what scenes
4:56
you're going to write today I find that
4:58
when I sit down with no really good clue
5:01
as to what is happening in the next
5:03
scene like I know what I wrote yesterday
5:05
but I don't really know where the story
5:07
is going words come very slowly because
5:09
I'm having to actually kind of figure
5:11
out the plot and the scenes and what's
5:13
happening and what's the purpose behind
5:14
this scene as I'm writing so it's
5:16
naturally going to come a little bit
5:18
slower but if I show up to my writing
5:21
sprint sessions which will talk about
5:22
Sprint's in a minute with a note card
5:25
that has just a few little things about
5:27
what's happening in the scene okay these
5:28
two characters are gonna argue or she's
5:30
gonna see him for the first time and
5:32
this is how she's going to react just
5:34
whatever and I actually have taken a
5:36
moment to not only write those note
5:37
cards down but to actually close my eyes
5:40
and see if I can visualize those two
5:42
characters in a room together and how
5:44
things are going to go I find that the
5:46
words will often flow so much faster so
5:49
one thing that I do in order to get to
5:52
that point is that when I'm writing you
5:54
know say I finished a writing session
5:56
this morning instead of just closing up
5:58
everything and moving on to whatever's
6:00
next I will take a couple of minutes and
6:03
visualize what just happened in the
6:05
scene and then what's the next logical
6:07
step because as we all know writing
6:10
scenes is a lot about action and then
6:13
reaction so if I've just had a big scene
6:15
where two characters had a big argument
6:17
one stormed out the door maybe I'm gonna
6:20
sit down and visualise okay what's gonna
6:22
happen when she walks out that door
6:24
what's her reaction and I'll just think
6:26
about what types of feelings she might
6:28
be feeling who she might go to she might
6:30
call up a friend and tell them exactly
6:32
what happened in this argument or if she
6:34
just found out some interesting
6:35
information she might act on
6:37
and go now to check out to see if it's
6:39
true but whatever it works for your
6:41
story whatever type of genre you're
6:43
writing you can usually visualize what
6:45
just happened on the page or the screen
6:47
if you want to call it that because I
6:49
sort of visualize my things like a movie
6:51
in my head and you can take that to the
6:53
next level and say okay then what
6:55
happens next so just take a second to
6:57
think about what happens next in your
6:59
story and visualize it and then jot down
7:02
a few little notes about what you see
7:03
happening tomorrow then when you come
7:06
back the next day to start your writing
7:08
see if that doesn't help you write a
7:11
little bit faster I'm telling you that
7:13
just five minutes of sitting down to
7:15
visualize and making those notes on what
7:17
happens tomorrow can make a huge
7:18
difference in how quickly the writing
7:20
comes tomorrow because when you sit down
7:22
with a clear idea of what's happening it
7:24
doesn't mean you have to have every
7:26
single little detail and all the
7:27
dialogue figured out but just to have
7:29
that general picture in your mind of
7:31
what's happening and how it feels and
7:33
what it looks like to your characters it
7:34
can go a long way to helping you write
7:36
faster so step two is to let go of
Let Go of Perfectionism
7:38
perfectionism so this is something I
7:41
talked about in my self-doubt video just
7:43
a week ago or so where I said you know
7:46
it's okay to just allow the words to
7:49
suck especially if you're writing a
7:51
rough draft if you want the words to
7:52
come quickly you can't be just pouring
7:55
over every single word choices that the
7:57
write you know description am I getting
7:59
the exact word that needs to be here you
8:02
know did they have this conversation
8:04
exactly the right words am i pulling
8:07
across like the perfect emotion between
8:09
them of course it depends on what kind
8:12
of writer you are some people love to
8:14
have everything perfect so they do very
8:15
little edits but if you're looking at
8:18
writing quickly and writing faster one
8:21
of the things you might try is just
8:22
totally letting go of those bitty little
8:24
word choices or those picky little word
8:26
choices and feeling like it has to be
8:28
perfect because a lot of people who
8:30
write more slowly it's because they're
8:32
really like agonizing over every single
8:35
word twice when really you just need to
8:37
get that story out you just need to
8:38
figure out what's happening and then you
8:40
can go back in the edits and you can
8:41
pour and agonize over those little tiny
8:43
word choices as much as you want but if
8:46
you want to write faster and getting the
8:48
story out then stop worrying about like
8:50
is that the right adjective did they
8:52
have the is that exactly what I want her
8:54
to say and let me go back and change
8:55
this 15 times just have her say what she
8:57
says and move on and let go of that
9:00
feeling that it needs to be perfect
9:02
another way of saying this is to embrace
9:04
the flow just let the words pour out
9:07
don't worry so much about every single
9:10
word choice but embrace that feeling of
9:12
flow that it's just flowing out of you
9:14
and once you can get past that point of
9:17
like doubting every single word that
9:18
comes across and just saying okay it's
9:21
not perfect but it needs to just keep
9:22
going sometimes I will even put in a
9:25
little note to myself inside my
9:26
manuscript that says I know this is not
9:28
the right word this sucks but I'm going
9:30
to keep going it's kind of like a little
9:31
cheerleading section inside my rough
9:33
draft where I tell myself just keep
9:35
going that's all that matters and once
9:37
you embrace that flow of not letting
9:38
your fingers stop moving you begin to
9:41
write faster and more confidently you
9:43
can go back and fix that when you get to
9:44
edits so number three which I'm not
9:46
going to talk about super long because
9:48
I've talked about this a lot before is
9:50
use word sprints a lot of times this is
Write in Word Sprints
9:53
also called the Pomodoro Technique which
9:55
is where you basically set a timer
9:57
anywhere from you know 10 minutes to 45
10:00
minutes whatever you decide as your best
10:03
like sweet spot for me most of the time
10:05
my Sprint's are about 25 minutes and
10:08
then I take a five-minute break
10:09
afterward and then I do another 25
10:11
minute and what this does is it kind of
10:13
tricks your brain to saying okay I don't
10:15
have to write for two hours and like
10:17
pour over everything because I find that
10:20
once I've been writing for 40 minutes I
10:22
start to have diminishing returns
10:24
I start to get tired I can no longer
10:26
clearly visualize my scenes I start to
10:29
get very easily distractible when a note
10:31
comes by like somebody's texted me I
10:33
tend to pay attention to it because I'm
10:35
kind of getting tired of writing for
10:36
this long stretch of time so 25 minutes
10:39
works perfectly for me because I can sit
10:41
down and I can say okay I only have to
10:44
focus for 25 minutes this will play into
10:46
the next tip as well but you know I
10:48
won't have any distractions I won't
10:50
allow any anyone to talk to me or
10:52
interrupt me I have 25 minutes of
10:54
focused writing time I find that it's
10:56
easier for me to just have that limited
10:58
amount of time that I have to severely
11:00
focus like acutely focus on my work and
11:03
then I get a break
11:04
okay now I can't take that break to sort
11:07
of visualize what just happened what's
11:08
happening next and it sort of builds up
11:10
this momentum without me getting tired
11:12
or fatigued now for me ten or fifteen
11:14
minutes is not enough time because I've
11:16
just started getting into the flow when
11:18
I'm interrupting it so I find that it's
11:21
best to go past the point of flow and
11:24
then once it you feel like you're
11:25
starting to get tired that's usually
11:27
your sweet spot now if you want to
11:28
figure out what your best writing sprint
11:31
number is like how much time then you
11:34
could just try a bunch of different ones
11:36
and experiment so we'll talk about this
11:37
later as well with a different tip but
11:40
just try them so start with ten minutes
11:42
do three or four of those today tomorrow
11:44
try 15 minutes and do three or four of
11:46
those and track how many words you get
11:48
per sprint how it feels and that sort of
11:50
thing and then the next day go up to
11:51
2025 and so on I know I have friends
11:54
that like to go for an hour at a time
11:55
and some friends that like to go only
11:57
ten minutes so it's going to be a very
11:59
personal thing but what I found is that
12:01
I can write just as many words in 25
12:03
minutes as I can in 35 minutes which
12:06
just sounds kind of weird just like 10
12:08
extra minutes right but I just start to
12:10
slow down so much if I have all that
12:12
extra time so just give yourself a
12:15
little bit of like a week to experiment
12:18
with different times to see what your
12:19
sweet spot is but my sweet spot tends to
12:22
be about 25 minutes so the fourth tip
12:24
goes hand in hand with the sprints
12:26
remember and that's to eliminate
Eliminate All Distractions
12:27
distractions so if you have a lot of
12:29
little little things dinging on your
12:31
phone and you've got like a bunch of
12:33
like notifications popping up in your
12:35
messenger or whatever on your computer
12:37
and you've got like somebody's you know
12:40
bouncing on the couch or knocking on
12:41
your door or whatever you're just not
12:44
going to get as much done and you could
12:46
sit down for two hours and end up mostly
12:48
distracted the entire time so one of the
12:51
best ways to write faster is to
12:52
eliminate those distractions and I know
12:54
it can be tough to like turn on airplane
12:57
mode or Do Not Disturb on your phone
13:00
sometimes you know not everybody has a
13:02
nice office that's all to themselves so
13:03
sometimes you're writing on the couch
13:05
and your kids are there and they're
13:06
jumping around and you've got those
13:07
describe distractions anyway but see if
13:09
you can find and carve out time in your
13:12
day where you can be completely
13:13
distraction free Facebook can wait text
13:16
messages can wait phone calls can wait
13:18
your kids can wait whatever it is that
13:20
you've got going on that's a distraction
13:22
see if you can carve out even you know
13:24
50 minutes or an hour of time for
13:26
yourself even 30 minutes for yourself
13:28
that is completely distraction free turn
13:31
your phone off turn it on just do not
13:33
disturb so that you can't hear any
13:35
little like dings that are going on and
13:37
just tell yourself you're gonna focus
13:39
this is why it goes hand-in-hand with
13:40
word sprints because if you set that
13:42
timer and you say I'm not gonna allow
13:43
any distractions during this timer you
13:46
tend to get more done because you've got
13:49
just a limited time without your brain
13:51
saying oh my gosh I have to go three
13:52
hours without like interacting with
13:54
anyone else which can start to seem or
13:56
feel a little bit lonely so give
13:59
yourself that 25 minute
14:00
word sprint then give yourself five
14:02
minutes to check your messages to check
14:03
your email if you want to or to go talk
14:05
to somebody like your roommate or
14:07
whatever real quick and then come back
14:08
and start all over again so removing
14:11
those distractions can be very helpful
14:14
in helping you to write faster so
14:16
remember how it's just telling you to
14:17
experiment with different times like 10
14:20
minutes 15 20 minute with your Sprint's
14:22
tip number five is to experiment with
14:24
different times of day and different
Experiment With Locations and Times
14:26
locations when it comes to your writing
14:28
so you know you may be stuck kind of in
14:31
a routine where it's like okay I'm a
14:33
night owl so I write every night from
14:35
9:00 to 10:00 p.m. or 9:00 to you know
14:38
11 p.m. and I'm always sitting on my
14:40
couch where you know my husband's over
14:42
here playing video games and you know
14:44
whatever whatever so you've got this
14:45
kind of routine of how you're writing
14:48
but you're consistently writing slower
14:49
than you want to write well one of the
14:51
things you might want to try is to
14:53
experiment with different times a day
14:54
and different locations now some of us
14:57
of course have full time jobs or we have
15:00
other responsibilities where it's like
15:01
we can't necessarily be a morning writer
15:03
or we can't write in the middle of the
15:05
afternoon but some of us also have you
15:07
know writing is our full-time job or we
15:09
have a lot more flexible schedule so
15:11
it's just going to depend on you but you
15:13
could always get up a little bit earlier
15:15
as painful as that might be for some of
15:17
us to try morning writing or you could
15:19
try writing write when you get home from
15:21
work or right after lunch or on your
15:23
lunch break but just sit down with a
15:25
notebook what you guys know I love
15:27
notebooks and ways to use them sit down
15:29
with a notebook and jot out all the
15:30
times
15:31
maybe for this upcoming week that you
15:33
could try writing when you don't
15:35
normally write and use it as a great
15:38
experiment treat it like a game and say
15:40
okay I'm gonna try writing over my lunch
15:41
break for this hour and I'm gonna eat my
15:43
lunch at my desk or I'm gonna eat my
15:45
lunch in the car and I'm gonna write in
15:46
the car whatever it is I'm gonna go down
15:48
to Starbucks for lunch and I'm gonna try
15:50
writing at that point see for a few days
15:53
if you do that how much writing you get
15:55
done during that one hour at Starbucks
15:57
or Panera Bread versus what you used to
16:00
get done in the evenings from 9:00 to
16:02
11:00 you might surprise yourself that
16:04
oh my gosh I love writing during my
16:06
lunch hour and I get twice as much done
16:07
in a smaller period of time you also
16:10
might normally be a night owl and try
16:13
getting up an hour earlier in writing in
16:15
the morning you might find that because
16:17
your brain is fresh you do get a lot
16:19
more done in the morning I used to
16:21
always be a night owl but after I had my
16:23
son seven years ago I realized I'm just
16:25
too exhausted in my brain my brain is
16:28
too fried a lot of the times at night so
16:30
I became more of a morning writer and it
16:32
was so shocking to me because I had
16:34
never been and never have considered
16:36
myself a morning person and I know that
16:38
with this new baby coming to you know
16:40
I'm gonna have to experiment all over
16:42
again with what times of day work best
16:44
for me so I encourage you as the next
16:46
tip to try different times of day and
16:48
different locations try going out to a
16:50
coffee shop try going to Panera or
16:53
something try going to your library
16:54
where things are super quiet try writing
16:56
with music try writing without music try
16:58
writing at home try writing in a
17:00
different area of your home like in your
17:01
bedroom or whatever and see like if you
17:04
track it and you see it in a notebook
17:06
like I tried this today and this is how
17:09
many words I got done then you can take
17:11
all that data and you can say okay
17:12
consistently when I go out to Starbucks
17:14
I get twice as much done and then you
17:16
can start doing that more often so just
17:18
experiment with times a day locations
17:20
and types of atmosphere and see what
17:23
starts to help you to write faster
17:25
number six is an easy one as well and
17:28
that's to improve your typing skills it
17:30
may sound very simple and it is but if
Improve Your Typing Skills
17:33
you're like one of these people that
17:34
uses two fingers to peck out your typing
17:37
you're going to be a lot slower than
17:38
someone who knows how to type and has
17:40
taken a typing course and knows exactly
17:42
where their fingers go and they can use
17:43
all of their fingers to be
17:44
typing if you just you know use two or
17:47
four fingers to type everything out then
17:49
probably one of the best things you can
17:51
do to improve your writing speed is to
17:53
learn how to type better I got super
17:56
lucky that I took a keyboarding or
17:57
typing class back in high school and
17:59
that really helped me a lot but I also
18:01
have a friend that introduced me to this
18:03
game called the typing of the Dead and I
18:05
am a huge like zombie fan like love
18:08
zombie movies and all tombi games and
18:10
stuff like that and she introduced me to
18:12
this very cheesy kind of like 70s style
18:14
game called the typing of the day that I
18:16
could buy for like five dollars or
18:18
something on Steam so I went and bought
18:20
that and it's basically a zombie will
18:22
pop out and I'll have a word over their
18:23
head and you type really fast and if you
18:25
can type the word correctly it kills the
18:27
zombie very cheesy kind of thing but I
18:29
go through and I play that once a week
18:31
to keep up with my typing skills and
18:33
guys it really helps so if you look for
18:35
different like typing games online or
18:37
ways to improve your typing or if like I
18:39
said you really don't even have a good
18:42
sense of where your fingers are supposed
18:43
to go and you've been kind of pecking
18:44
things out improve your typing skills
18:47
that's gonna help you write so much
18:48
faster because your brain is always
18:50
going to be going faster than your
18:51
fingers so if you can bring your fingers
18:53
up to speed with how fast your brain is
18:55
thinking then you're going to
18:57
immediately write faster if anybody
18:59
knows of some good typing courses or
19:01
other typing games that are really fun
19:02
go ahead and pop those in the comments
19:04
below
19:04
so talking about bringing your fingers
19:07
up to speed with the speed of your brain
19:09
and your thoughts the next tip is to try
Learn How To Dictate Your Work
19:13
dictation now I will admit that this is
19:15
something I really have not been able to
19:16
get in to super well but I also
19:18
admittedly have not spent a lot of time
19:20
trying to make it work but this is
19:22
probably the number one thing I hear my
19:24
fellow authors say improved their
19:26
writing speed like exponentially is
19:29
dictating and what dictating is is
19:31
instead of typing out your story you
19:34
read your story you you just dictate it
19:36
you talk it out so instead of typing
19:39
each word and only moving as fast as
19:41
your fingers can go you can go as fast
19:43
as your voice and your mouth can go so
19:45
you would just open a program like
19:47
Dragon Dictation
19:48
I believe like word and Google Docs also
19:51
have some form of dictation but they're
19:52
not going to be as like beefy of
19:54
programs as something like Dragon
19:56
Dictation or Dragon NaturallySpeaking
19:58
but I have heard that some people can
20:00
get as many as three four thousand and
20:02
more words per hour just speaking their
20:07
text instead of typing it out now there
20:10
is a learning curve involved in this
20:12
because it you know we're so used to
20:14
writing our stories by typing of
20:16
thinking it and we type it so when you
20:18
actually have to say it you have to
20:20
learn how to add punctuation and you
20:22
have to train the software to work with
20:25
your voice and there's going to be typos
20:26
and things that it misunderstood and
20:28
you're going to have to learn how to say
20:30
comma in quotes and all these little
20:32
like commands that have to go with this
20:33
so it may be slow going at first as
20:36
you're learning it or as you're training
20:37
yourself and you're training your
20:39
program to recognize your voice but in
20:41
the long run it is one of the ways to
20:42
increase your speed what scares me about
20:45
it and what I haven't really tried it in
20:47
earnest is because I'm not sure that it
20:50
will sound right to me to be like Harper
20:53
said this or whatever I feel like I need
20:55
that kind of delay for my typing fingers
20:57
because I don't know if I could speak it
21:00
out but it also just be my fear of
21:03
actually speaking my words out loud and
21:06
feeling a little bit awkward and having
21:08
somebody else you know being able to
21:10
hear me and what I'm saying with my
21:12
story I don't know but it's just
21:13
something I haven't personally tried but
21:15
I had to mention it here because I do
21:17
know that in terms of increasing your
21:19
speed exponentially it's probably the
21:22
biggest tool out there which would be
21:24
using dictation so I know that the
21:26
biggest program that people tend to use
21:28
is Dragon NaturallySpeaking or the
21:30
Dragon Dictation and it does cost money
21:32
but there are other free programs out
21:34
there as well that you could try like
21:36
inside Google Docs they do have some
21:37
dictation if you just wanted to practice
21:39
it but then you're going to need some
21:41
equipment too like a microphone and that
21:42
sort of thing
21:44
and there's a learning curve but it
21:45
could be pretty huge and increasing your
21:48
productivity when it comes to writing
21:50
speed and the final tip that I have for
21:52
you today tip number eight is to be
21:55
consistent so if you work on your story
Be Consistent With Your Writing
21:58
a little bit this weekend and then two
22:00
weeks from now you pick it up again and
22:02
you say okay what what happened you're
22:04
gonna have to like go back read through
22:06
what you wrote last time try to get back
22:08
into the like mood and the vibe of that
22:10
story you have to try
22:12
remember exactly where your thought
22:13
process was and you're just constantly
22:15
like having to go through that process
22:16
of like re familiarizing yourself with
22:19
your story but if you're consistent
22:21
especially when you're drafting your
22:23
story and you're writing that first
22:24
rough draft and you try to at least
22:26
spend time every single day working on
22:28
that story you're going to naturally
22:30
write faster because you don't have that
22:33
process of having to like read back
22:35
through and think what's going on in the
22:36
scene I can't remember what was going on
22:38
with this character or where she was or
22:40
what she was thinking I can't remember
22:41
what I was thinking about this character
22:43
you would just be able to say oh I know
22:45
where I was yesterday and now I'm going
22:47
to continue on with that today being
22:49
consistent is also something that it's
22:51
going to help you write faster because
22:53
like I said your brain is already in
22:55
that space if you follow my tip number
22:57
one you've already kind of visualized
22:59
what's happening in what you're writing
23:01
today you don't have to sort of reinvent
23:03
the wheel but when you are not touching
23:06
your story consistently and what I mean
23:08
by touching your story is at least
23:09
reading through working through the plot
23:11
thinking about your characters if you're
23:13
even if you're not getting new words you
23:15
need to be touching that story on a
23:16
daily basis okay so maybe you take
23:19
Sundays off or something and that's no
23:20
big deal that you took one day off but
23:22
it's when you start to take four and
23:24
five six days off in between writing you
23:27
always have on that seventh day to pick
23:30
back up where you are and get yourself
23:31
familiar all over again with the story
23:33
with the characters with what was
23:35
happening and you also tend to lose
23:37
ideas so you might have this great
23:38
visualization and this great idea of
23:40
what's supposed to happen in this next
23:43
scene and now you've forgotten it
23:44
because you don't really understand your
23:46
notes anymore or it's been a week since
23:47
you even looked at it or even a month
23:49
since you last looked at it so if you're
23:51
a slower writer but you also notice that
23:54
you haven't been like consistently daily
23:57
working on your story or working on it
23:58
four or five times a week or whatever
24:00
that number is for you then that would
24:03
be another good place to start to
24:04
improve your writing speed is to be
24:06
consistent and touch that story every
24:08
single day alright guys so those are my
24:11
eight tips for how to start writing
24:12
faster and remember only only write
24:15
faster comparing yourself to your
24:17
current skill level to your current
24:19
speed don't compare yourself to anyone
24:21
else because compare yourself to other
24:23
people and allowing that to
24:25
distract you or to make you feel worse
24:27
about yourself there's just really no
24:29
room in that in writing for that so
24:31
eliminate those kinds of thoughts and
24:33
don't try to write faster just because
24:35
someone else is writing faster write
24:37
faster for yourself and of course we all
24:40
want to go back and edit our books to
24:43
the best of our ability and focus on
24:44
quality books but when you're writing
24:46
your rough draft it's okay sometimes to
24:48
skip the feeling of every word needing
24:50
to be perfect and just let the flow of
24:54
words come out of you and don't worry so
24:56
much about the details of every single
24:58
word then when you go back to your edits
25:00
it's gonna be a lot better that you've
25:02
got the story down as quickly as
25:04
possible you can fix anything in any
25:06
word choice that's on the page speaking
25:08
of editing I do have an entire series on
25:12

25:14

Writing Tips

hey guys welcome back to heart
0:01
breathing's we are on video number four
0:03
of my how to edit your novel series and
0:05
today we're gonna be talking about
0:07
something that I know plagues so many
0:09
writers is how do you know when your
0:12
book is done how do you know when it's
0:14
finished and you're done fiddling with
0:16
it and it's ready to go well I'm gonna
0:18
give you a few tips here today so stay
0:20
tuned so this is one of those things
0:27
that is tough for every writer
0:29
especially when it's your first novel
0:31
how do you know when it's good enough
0:33
and how do you know when you're done
0:35
fiddling with it and it's ready to go
0:36
off to an agent or it's ready to send
0:38
off to your editor or you're ready to
0:40
self publish it and so polishing makes
0:43
it even more like ah because you no
0:47
longer have that like agent or you know
0:50
publisher who's telling you okay now
0:51
it's ready and you've got all that
0:53
feedback or they're guiding you through
0:55
the process when it comes to
0:56
self-publishing there's no one who
0:58
decides that it's ready and it's your
1:00
time to publish except for you because
1:02
you're the author and you're ultimately
1:04
your publisher as well so that's made it
1:07
a little bit harder because it used to
1:09
be you know you would send it out when
1:11
you felt like it was ready and an agent
1:13
would you know represent it or not and
1:15
then it would go to a publishing house
1:17
who would decide that it was ready or
1:19
not and then they would help you edit it
1:21
and then they would put a deadline on it
1:23
and it would be done and I'm not saying
1:24
that makes the editing process easy but
1:27
it just makes it even more challenging
1:29
when you're publishing your own novel so
1:31
you know how do you know when it is
1:33
ready to send off to that agent or when
1:35
you are ready to self publish it so
1:38
here's where it gets tricky guys there
1:41
as you know there is no magical editing
1:44
fairy that's going to just come down
1:46
from wherever and sit on your shoulder
1:48
and say oh you know your book is
1:50
finished this is it you know there's no
1:52
like chorus of angels that's going to
1:54
sing there's no you know moment where
1:56
you're going to type for the words and
1:58
suddenly the computer will pop up with a
2:00
message that says that's it you're done
2:02
the book is done unfortunately it would
2:05
be great if that was something that
2:07
happened but sadly that is not ever
Fears
2:09
going to happen it's totally up to you
2:11
and that is where things get
2:13
terrifying like what if it's not good
2:15
enough what if the readers don't love it
2:17
what if you know I put something out
2:19
that's crap or that's nowhere near what
2:21
I feel like I could do and those are all
2:24
natural fears that come about and their
2:27
fears you're just going to have to face
2:29
as an author because like I said
2:31
especially if you're self-publishing
2:32
there's never anyone who's going to give
2:34
you permission and say okay this is it
2:37
you're ready to go unless maybe you hire
2:40
an editor that you ask them to like tell
2:42
me when it's ready and then you have to
2:43
pay them a lot of money to keep going
2:45
through your book over and over again
2:47
and most of us just don't have that kind
2:48
of luxury so you know how do you know
2:51
and the first little tip that I'm gonna
2:55
give you after more than 25 books
2:57
published and finished at this point I
2:59
do have I will give a little note there
3:02
that there are several books at least
3:04
three books in my like closet under the
3:07
bed so to speak that have not been
3:08
published because I was writing for
3:10
years before I published my first novel
3:12
but even going back to that first novel
3:15
back in 2010 you know I can look at it
3:18
now and I can see all the juvenile
3:21
writing all the mistakes although like
3:24
places where I told instead of showing
3:27
or places where I used lazy language or
3:30
you know whatever and that book is very
3:31
shorts 50,000 words or a little bit less
3:33
than 50,000 words but I could go back
3:36
now and I could re addit that book a
3:38
hundred times and then five years from
3:40
now I could read it again because you're
3:41
constantly learning so in that way my
3:44
first tip for you guys is that it's
3:47
never going to be totally finished like
3:50
no work of art is ever completely
3:52
finished and that is one of the great
3:55
challenges is you know you could let
3:57
something sit and then two months later
4:00
you can come back to it and there's
4:01
always something like maybe I could
4:03
fiddle with this word maybe I could
4:05
change this little thing maybe this
4:06
comma would be better here maybe I
4:08
should go into this characters like
4:10
thoughts a little bit more here there's
4:13
always going to be things like I bet I
4:14
could go back to beautiful demons which
4:16
was my first published book in 2010 and
4:19
I bet I could add twenty or thirty
4:20
thousand words to it knowing what I know
4:22
now I could make it a lot better but it
4:26
wouldn't be worth it for me to
4:27
do that because that book was part of my
4:29
journey it was where I was at the time
4:31
and if you were to pick up beautiful
4:34
demons and then also go pick up the most
4:37
recent book in that series which is book
4:39
10 you know and read all the way through
4:40
you would see the journey of my writing
4:43
as you go through it because book 10 is
4:45
you know masterpiece compared to book 1
Perfection
4:48
but I'm sure 10 years from now when I
4:50
look back on book 10 deceiving darkness
4:53
I'm gonna be like oh my gosh look at all
4:55
these mistakes I made and so just the
4:58
mindset of understanding that you're
5:00
never going to have a book that is pure
5:03
perfection and it was exactly what you
5:05
wanted it to be and it came out exactly
5:07
like it needed to be and it was the best
5:09
novel ever written and you'll never come
5:11
back to it and think of you know things
5:13
that you could change about it so that
5:16
is good news because it means you don't
5:18
have to be perfect nothing has to be
5:20
like the best book ever written you
5:23
don't have to put that kind of pressure
5:24
on yourself but it's bad news because
5:28
you how do you know when you're done
5:31
fiddling with it and it's good enough to
5:32
be published and so that's kind of what
5:35
we're going to talk about but I wanted
5:36
to address that first that you know it's
5:38
never going to be where it's just done
5:41
and there's nothing you could change
5:43
about it to make it better or different
5:45
in any way because there's oh you know
5:47
it's art there's always something you
5:49
could change so you have to let go of
5:51
the idea that you're going to someday
5:54
just be so done with this that it's
5:56
perfect and there's not a single word on
5:58
the page that could change or you know
6:00
you would ruin it like there's just
6:02
never going to be that point so go ahead
6:04
and get that in your mind first and
6:06
you'll be better off so back to the
6:09
question at hand when is it done when do
6:12
you know it's done and again the first
6:15
little tip that I'm gonna give you here
6:17
is maybe one that's going to frustrate
6:19
you a little bit but it's the most truth
6:21
that I have learned over the course of
6:23
almost nine years of writing
6:26
professionally which is it's done when
6:29
it feels right and if you've never
6:33
finished a novel before that is going to
6:35
seem like very ethereal advice like what
6:38
when does it feel right first
6:40
feel wrong I will tell you this every
6:43
novel including that first novel that I
6:45
published back in 2010 has had a moment
6:50
in the editing where the way I like to
6:53
describe it is you know when you have
6:55
those like lock combinations right where
6:58
you're spinning the dial and you have to
7:00
turn it one way and then turn it the
7:02
other way and when you turn it that last
7:04
little bit that little tumbler or
7:06
whatever and you feel it click into
7:07
place and you can pull it down you know
7:09
I'm thinking of those like lockers that
7:10
you had in school you know the locks
7:13
like that there's always a moment for me
7:16
with every book where I just feel that
7:19
last little tumbler or that last little
7:21
key fall into place and I know that my
7:24
story has been unlocked and this is the
7:25
way it is and this is the way it was
7:27
meant to be now that doesn't mean that
7:30
there's not a word on the page that I
7:32
could change or something I could fix or
7:34
a typo still sitting in there somewhere
7:36
or like maybe this conversation could be
7:38
tweaked because like I said there's
7:39
always room for improvement but there's
7:43
always this part of me instinctually
7:45
that goes that's it this is the story
7:49
that I was going to tell and I can feel
7:52
it
7:53
so when you hit that point in your story
7:55
where you know where you that little bit
7:58
of magical like you know key or whatever
8:01
falls into place and the story is
8:03
unlocked and this is the major building
8:06
blocks of the story that it has come
8:08
together and it feels the way that you
8:10
want it to feel that is the first step
Trust
8:12
toward knowing that your book is done so
8:14
it's about trusting your instincts and I
8:16
understand 100% that hearing me say that
8:20
might be terrifying for some of you that
8:22
haven't finished your first novel
8:23
because you're thinking I don't know
8:25
what feels right but this is where you
8:28
have to trust yourself and you have to
8:30
trust the process maybe you haven't felt
8:33
that experience yet because you haven't
8:35
pushed yourself to that point maybe
8:38
you've hit the middle or you've finished
8:40
a rough draft and you're still messing
8:41
and fiddling with the edits but you're
8:43
too scared to really just let yourself
8:46
immerse in it or to let yourself be done
8:48
with it take a step and go how does this
8:51
feel how does this feel in terms of
8:54
the story that I knew I wanted to create
8:57
like I was going to tell a story about a
8:59
girl who is abandoned had no parents you
9:03
know was in foster home to foster home
9:06
and comes into this haunted sort of
9:09
spooky house and discovers there are
9:11
secrets in this town that tied to her
9:13
past
9:14
I wanted that story and I want it to
9:16
feel a certain way and I knew that as I
9:18
was writing and so when that story
9:21
unlocked for me and I felt it fall into
9:24
place I knew that I had told the story I
9:27
meant to tell and yes words could be
9:29
changed here and there but after you've
9:31
been through the process like if you go
9:34
back and watch that first video in this
9:37
series how to self edit your novel once
9:40
you've been through that series of steps
9:43
and it's been through you know the
9:45
rounds of edits you've read it out loud
9:47
you've changed all these things it's
9:49
really about how does it feel and once
9:51
it feels like it's come into place and
9:53
you've done the best work you can do to
9:55
make sure the words are the right words
9:56
and you've expressed yourself then the
9:58
book is done and that's when you send it
10:00
off and you start to get feedback and
10:02
it's going to go through a few different
10:04
rounds of you know feedback with other
10:06
people be it critique partners beta
10:07
readers editors whatever agents maybe if
10:11
you're traditionally publishing and you
10:13
know it will get better but those things
10:16
are just refining the process and then
10:18
you're going to say okay now it's it's
10:20
done but it's really about feeling your
10:22
way through it and trusting that when it
10:25
seems to click for you it's like this
10:27
innate knowing that it's this is the
10:30
story I was meant to tell and it's done
10:32
then you can move forward and like I
Learning Every Step
10:36
said if you haven't ever hit that point
10:38
yet it's because you haven't you know
10:40
pushed yourself through to the end of
10:41
this process and I will tell you as much
10:46
as I don't want to say this that
10:47
sometimes there might be stories for you
10:50
if this is your first second or third
10:52
novel that you've tried to write that
10:54
you may never get to that point that
10:56
somehow you have taken so many tours and
10:59
detours and changes and everything that
11:02
your story that you originally meant to
11:04
tell is unrecognizable and you can't see
11:06
how to bring it together
11:07
and sometimes that might mean that you
11:10
need to set that story aside if you've
11:12
been working on it for years and it just
11:13
feels like this big mess and it never
11:15
feels like it's come together the way
11:17
you wanted it to maybe it's time to move
11:19
on to a different story but that's a
11:22
video for another time because I also
11:23
know so many authors who have you know
11:26
hit that point and then just moved on to
11:28
another story and then a year later
11:30
another story and then another story and
11:32
they never bring themselves to that
11:33
point but you have to understand that
11:35
you are learning every step of the way
11:38
so first way that you know when it's
11:41
done is when it feels right when you
11:43
feel like the story you were meant to
11:45
tell that you were intending to tell is
11:48
there on the page and at this point it's
11:51
just about word choice here and there
11:53
but the story is there that's when you
11:55
know you're on the path to done so the
11:58
second piece of this is you know you're
12:00
done at that point you know story has
12:02
come together and it's unlocked itself
12:04
and now you're just endlessly fiddling
12:07
with this word choice or that word
12:09
choice should I do this or should I do
12:10
that and it becomes these very tiny
12:12
minuscule decisions like when you're no
12:15
longer messing with the whole big
12:18
picture like the story isn't you know
12:21
being messed with the characters are all
12:23
in place everything's on the page and
12:25
all you've been doing for the last you
12:27
know however many weeks or months or
12:28
years some of you is changing a word
12:31
here and there like oh maybe this maybe
12:33
I've used too many adjectives let me go
12:35
change this oh maybe this character's
12:37
voice is you know I need to simplify her
12:40
dialogue or should I use the word
12:42
lovingly or you know should I change
12:46
that to not an L Y word or you know
12:48
whatever like when you're getting to
12:51
that point where it's between this word
12:53
or this word like he caressed her cheek
12:55
or he cupped her cheek it doesn't really
12:57
matter at this point yes word choice
12:59
matters but you could spend a lifetime
13:02
going through every single word of your
13:04
novel and not really making it better
13:06
just changing words here and there and
13:08
it's not going to affect the essence of
13:10
the story it's not going to truly make
13:13
it better and in fact you might start
13:15
adding so many like adjectives and
13:17
melodrama and all the stuff that you're
13:18
making it worse so
13:20
pay attention to when you hit a point in
13:23
your manuscript that all you're doing is
13:25
just fiddling with words here and there
13:26
over and over and over and reading back
13:28
through and changing little tiny little
13:30
tweaks your story is done it's time to
13:33
send it off to an editor let them tell
13:36
you what needs to be fixed and then you
13:38
need to let that story go and then
13:39
anything that you feel you need to
13:41
improve can be improved in the next
13:43
novel but when all you're doing is
13:45
fiddling with those little tiny tiny
13:47
details over and over again it's time to
13:49
let the story go if you've been through
13:51
these steps that I gave you in the first
13:54
video and you've been through the
13:56
reading aloud and the self-edit and you
13:58
know the several rounds it's done on
14:01
that same line on that same wavelength
14:05
when you can't think of any way to
14:08
really make your story better when
14:10
you're reading back through it again and
14:12
nothing like stands out to you if like
14:14
gosh I could really make this stronger
14:16
or you know this really needs a little
14:18
bit more explanation or his motivation
14:20
isn't quite there or this plot twist
14:22
doesn't come together right when you're
14:23
done with those big story arc things and
14:26
now you really just can't think of
14:29
anything to make it better your story is
14:31
done it may not be the Great American
14:33
Novel it may not be the best novel ever
14:36
written but you have put together the
14:38
best that you're capable of with this
14:40
story right now and you know it's done
14:41
because there's nothing coming to you
14:43
for how to make it better and all the
14:45
pieces are there so that's in my opinion
14:47
when it's time to let it go let other
14:49
people read it and then move on so since
When Your Book Is Done
14:52
I just mentioned letting other people
14:54
read it when no one comes back to you
14:57
your critique partners your beta readers
14:58
your editors when nobody comes back to
15:00
you with any like major fixes or wow
15:03
this really needs a lot of work and it's
15:05
full of red marks like when it's just
15:07
basically a few little word choice
15:09
things here and there your book is done
15:12
like I said when I was working with a
15:14
critique group back in the day I found
15:17
this critique group mainly for knit
15:18
through NaNoWriMo and like write-ins
15:20
which I highly recommend participating
15:23
in if you get a chance but I found this
15:26
group through there and we were meeting
15:28
once a week and I would read some of
15:30
their stuff they would read chapters of
15:31
mine and in the beginning of my story
15:33
and in my
15:34
there would be big things for them to
15:37
mention like oh gosh you know this part
15:40
doesn't really make sense that they're
15:41
going all this way or they're doing this
15:42
or XYZ and so I'd have big things to
15:45
change but as my writing grew and as I
15:49
got more polished chapters for them to
15:51
read again the changes that they would
15:54
have or to suggest would be like I was
15:56
saying like simple word choices he
15:58
caressed her face instead of he cupped
16:00
her face or he touched her face just
16:02
like one words here and there would be
16:05
all they would have to critique and at
16:07
that point it's just a matter of voice
16:09
right it's just a matter of like the
16:12
feel of the book but you're not really
16:13
making it better if you change it from
16:15
cup to caress tour from touched to I
16:18
don't know what else but like once
16:20
you're just changing those tiny little
16:22
words you're not really making the novel
16:24
better you're just making it slightly
16:26
different so at that point you can kind
16:28
of step back read it through one more
16:29
time ago okay this is as good as it gets
16:32
and I am done with this so when nobody
16:34
that you're getting feedback from on a
16:36
regular basis has anything like really
16:38
big story wise to tell you or you know
16:41
it's not just full of all these typos
16:43
and grammar mistakes and the dialog tags
16:45
are wrong like when there's tons of
16:46
comments you've got work to do but when
16:48
there's just little worn toys fiddling
16:50
you're done you're done baby so the last
16:54
little piece of advice that I have for
16:55
you which this one might sound a little
16:57
bit silly to some people but it's just
17:01
part of the process especially when
17:02
you're indie publishing but you know
17:04
when the deadline comes when you have
17:08
set yourself a deadline like this is
17:10
going to be done by June 30th and I'm
17:12
gonna be completely done fiddling with
17:14
it when you hit that deadline if like I
17:17
said all you're doing is just fiddling
17:18
with a word toys here and there or like
17:20
one scene that didn't come together
17:21
perfectly but it's basically the way you
17:23
wanted it to be it's just you know maybe
17:26
it's not as perfect as you want or
17:28
you're scared because it's a risky scene
17:30
or whatever if you hit that deadline and
17:32
all you're doing is fiddling with word
17:33
choice and there's no more like big
17:35
story arc to change the book is done and
17:37
it's time to move on to the next step in
17:40
the process now this is one that I will
17:42
kind of put with a warning because you
17:45
don't want to
17:47
start publishing a bunch of books that
17:49
are very mediocre that are like not at
17:51
all what you're capable of just because
17:54
okay I hit a deadline and I'm trying to
17:56
rush and publish quickly I will just
17:58
very briefly speak to the fact that
18:00
right now especially in Indy publishing
18:02
and especially with Kindle unlimited if
18:04
you're familiar with what that is there
18:06
is a rush right now everybody feels like
18:09
they are rushed to publish and they're
18:11
trying to put out you know ten books a
18:12
year or however many books a year and so
18:15
there are a lot of people like I said I
18:18
don't try to try to add judgment
18:20
anywhere because there are a lot of
18:21
people that can write that many books
18:23
and they can stay quality and they can
18:24
stay on track with it but there's also a
18:26
lot of people out there who are putting
18:29
out what they know is not their best
18:31
writing just to try to make money
18:32
quickly and I would really warn you
18:35
against that kind of publishing because
18:37
eventually that's going to come back to
18:39
bite you you may make money this year
18:40
because you put out books really fast
18:42
but you're not necessarily building a
18:44
fanbase because readers know what's good
18:47
and what's not good so if you're putting
18:49
out stuff that's constantly like subpar
18:51
full of typos or like just the plot
18:53
doesn't come together fully you're not
18:55
really going to be gathering lifelong
18:57
fans which is what we hopefully would
18:59
want to do if you're trying to build a
19:01
true career as an author so it's
19:04
constantly this balance between you know
19:06
how fast can I write and publish versus
19:08
you know how can I put out the most
19:10
quality book I can and like I said
19:12
that's like an entire can of worms that
19:14
I just opened there and I don't have
19:17
time to go into that but I do want to
19:18
say that you know you don't want to set
19:20
unrealistic deadlines for yourself where
19:22
you're like expecting to finish a book
19:24
in three weeks and then if it's not good
19:26
enough well who cares I'm just gonna put
19:28
it out anyway to make money if that's
19:30
what you want to do then you do you and
19:33
you live your career in your life the
19:34
way you want but in my opinion if you
19:36
want to build a true lasting career
19:39
where you're building up fans that will
19:41
love you forever that will be loyal
19:42
forever and books that you'll be proud
19:44
to look back on five years from now then
19:47
you need to give yourself realistic
19:49
deadlines and say okay I'm gonna give
19:50
myself X amount of months to finish this
19:52
but you do need to give yourself some
19:55
kind of deadline otherwise you could be
19:57
working on the same book for ten years
19:58
and never
19:59
finishing it or like I said you could be
20:02
constantly cycling through books like oh
20:04
I'm gonna try this one and you work on
20:05
it for a year it doesn't feel like it's
20:07
coming together so you move on to the
20:09
next book and move on to the next book
20:10
let me know in the comments if you've
20:12
been caught in that trap before because
20:14
I think we all have kind of hit that
20:16
point where like this book isn't coming
20:18
together I'm going to write something
20:19
different right and sometimes it's
20:21
necessary but most of the time it's just
20:23
your fear talking if you can set a
20:25
deadline a realistic deadline for
20:27
yourself
20:28
even if it's like okay after the rough
20:30
draft is finished and now you're
20:31
starting your edits you could give
20:33
yourself a rough estimate of a deadline
20:35
for each round of those edits like okay
20:37
I'm going to be done with this like
20:38
overarching self edit this first pass by
20:42
two weeks I'm gonna give myself two
20:44
weeks to do that and then I'm going to
20:45
give myself a week to do the line edits
20:47
and then I'm gonna give myself xxx and
20:50
you continue to give yourself these kind
20:52
of mini deadlines then what you can do
20:54
is you can say you know I'm gonna give
20:57
myself until June 30th or whatever the
21:00
date is to be completely done with this
21:02
book if you hit that deadline and like I
21:06
said it feels like the story is in place
21:09
all you're doing is messing with tiny
21:11
little word choices here and there
21:12
nobody has any feedback to give that is
21:15
you know devastating or completely story
21:18
exploding or you know completely needs
21:20
to change your story then you can safely
21:23
say I have finished this book and when
21:26
you pass it off to that final proof
21:28
reader or that final editor it feels
21:30
good to you it may be scary but it feels
21:32
like okay I've done the best I can
21:34
because the danger of course is that we
21:37
hold on to books and we try to make them
21:40
so good and we try to make them the very
21:43
best that you know we try to compare our
21:45
writing to the best authors we've ever
21:47
read and we try to make it as good as
21:50
they are but that person might have
21:51
written and published 100 novels and
21:53
you're on your very first so you can't
21:55
really it's not fair to yourself to
21:57
compare yourself to that other writer
21:59
you have to start where you are
22:01
understand where you are and do the best
22:03
you can but eventually you do need to be
22:05
done with your novel and you have to
22:07
move on like I said you know when I
22:09
finished beautiful demons back in 2010 I
22:12
wrote that book with the intention of
22:14
self-publishing it and I felt like that
22:18
little lock clicked into place the story
22:21
was what I wanted it to be and I knew
22:24
deep down that it was the best I could
22:27
do at the time I can look back at it now
22:29
and see all the changes that I could
22:31
make but that's always going to be the
22:33
case there's always tiny word choices
22:35
there's you're always going to be
22:37
growing as a writer you're always going
22:39
to be learning more as you go and
22:41
through experience so you can't just
22:44
hold on to things forever tweaking
22:46
little words here and there is the story
22:48
what it was meant to be does it feel
22:50
good to you have you hit your deadline
22:52
have you been through those other
22:54
processes in terms of you've self edited
22:57
the storyline you've gone back through
22:59
craft and the story you've self edited
23:02
you know line edited your book on your
23:04
own you've read it aloud you've gone
23:06
through like put it through grammar
23:08
check or through spellcheck you've sent
23:11
it off to a line editor or critique
23:13
group or something like that
23:15
once you've followed all those steps
23:17
it's time to let that story fly to let
23:20
it go and to move on because that's how
23:22
we grow into the novelist that we're
23:24
meant to be we do the best we can with
23:27
this story and then we let it go we let
23:30
it free we put it out there and then we
23:32
move on to the next one so if you take
23:35
nothing else from this video just take
23:36
this that you know there really will
23:39
never be a point in time where anyone
23:42
gives you permission to publish or says
23:44
this is as good as it's going to be you
23:46
have to learn you have to learn how to
23:49
trust yourself that you will know when
23:52
it's good enough and you have to be able
23:54
to step away from your own fear enough
23:57
to be able to say this may not be the
24:01
best I will be able to do in my entire
24:03
lifetime but I feel proud of this I feel
24:05
like this is the best I could do I feel
24:07
like this is the story I set out to tell
24:09
and it's good enough and I'm gonna let
24:12
it go and I think that that comes with
24:16
experience but it also comes with just
24:19
trusting yourself as an artist and that
24:21
is something that you're gonna have to
24:25
learn to do if you
24:26
do this professionally so hopefully you
24:28
have gotten something out of this I hate
24:30
that I can't give you an exact set of
24:33
steps because there just really isn't
24:34
and so even though this might be a
24:36
question that has plagued you for a long
24:38
time I hope that you understand that you
24:40
do have inside of you the knowledge of
24:43
whether your story is right or not so
24:46
you have to learn to trust that and then
24:47
you have to move forward I'm wishing you
24:49
the best and I hope that you have
24:51
enjoyed this series so far on editing we
24:54
just have one more video to go which
24:56
