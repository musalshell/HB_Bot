
hey you guys welcome back to heart
0:02
briefings I am so excited because today
0:05
we are on video number four of our how
0:08
to plot your novel series and we are
0:09
going to be talking about how to plot
0:11
the first half of act 2 so like I said
0:18
welcome back we are now on video number
0:20
4 of my how to plot your novel series if
0:23
you are new to this channel or new to
0:25
this series I will link the playlist
0:27
down below for all the rest of this
0:29
series where we talked about the
0:31
overview of story structure how to write
0:33
great characters and in video number 3
0:36
we talked about act 1 now we are moving
0:38
on to the first half of act 2 now act 2
0:42
is really the largest part of your story
0:45
and it's twice as long usually as act 1
0:48
sometimes a little bit more than twice
0:49
as long and so it's easier in most
0:52
instances when we're talking about
0:54
different parts of the story to break it
0:56
into two parts so today we're going to
0:58
talk about the first half of Act two and
1:00
next week we will be covering the second
1:03
half of Act two and I know I've
1:04
mentioned this before but if you would
1:06
like a copy of my how to plot your novel
1:07
workbook that we're going through
1:09
throughout the series you can get it at
1:11
my website at heart breathing's calm
1:13
slash plot your novel and it is a free
1:16
download with a resource list for what I
1:18
would say are my favorite books on
1:20
plotting and everything that I'm taking
1:22
you through like my process are things
1:24
that I have learned from these books so
1:26
I highly recommend because I have read a
1:29
ton of books on plotting like just about
1:31
everything I can get my hands on except
1:33
for someone recommended the plot whisper
1:35
the other day and I have not read that
1:36
one I have read a lot of books on
1:38
plotting and the resources that I list
1:40
in the back of this workbook are really
1:42
and truly my favorite and if you don't
1:45
want to grab the workbook I also and
1:47
linking the resources down below in the
1:48
description box so please check out
1:50
these books because these are the ones I
1:52
have found that helped me the most like
1:54
I think sometimes with plotting it's
1:55
just about what clicks you know what
1:58
clicks on that light for you so anyway
2:00
let's get into the elements of the first
2:02
half of Act two so where Act one was
2:05
basically setting up your character your
2:08
story world as it is in the very
2:09
beginning and introducing the conflict
2:12
then you've got like I
2:13
said that inciting event or something
2:16
that happens they are the first plot
2:18
point at the end of act 1 that turns
2:20
your characters world upside down they
2:22
are being sent off to a school they are
2:24
finding out that their friend was
2:26
murdered and now they've decided to
2:27
investigate it might be the first murder
2:29
actually occurred and now your detective
2:31
is somehow being pulled into it and now
2:33
they're committed to finding this or
2:35
solving it for whatever reason whatever
2:37
happens at the last part of act 1 is
2:39
what locks your character into the story
2:41
now for good they're like in it until
2:44
the end what you need to know about act
2:46
2 is we've got that reaction in the
2:48
beginning to whatever happened at the
2:50
end of Act one that first plot point
2:53
that changed your character's world that
2:54
introduced something new that locked
2:56
them in to what James Scott bell calls
2:59
the death stakes this is where your
3:01
character is locked into sort of a
3:04
do-or-die situation now in it depends on
3:06
what type of genre in terms of is this a
3:09
literal death your character is truly in
3:11
danger of actually dying or being killed
3:13
or is this a figurative death
3:15
psychological death in some way so for a
3:18
romantic comedy it's obviously not going
3:20
to be something where it's like oh if
3:22
your character doesn't fall in love
3:23
they're going to be killed by a serial
3:25
killer but it could be something more
3:27
like if your heroine doesn't get out
3:28
from under her narcissistic mother and
3:31
finally move into being her own self and
3:35
following her own dreams which has
3:37
something to do with this hero who is
3:38
pulling her out of her shell then she
3:41
will never be happy which is a
3:42
figurative or a psychological death so
3:45
it depends on the genre that you're
3:46
writing in terms of how the stakes show
3:48
themselves but whatever it is that
3:50
happened they are at the beginning or at
3:52
the end of act 1 now your character is
3:54
going to be reacting to it in some way
3:56
at the beginning of act 2 so the first
3:59
few scenes are going to be your
4:01
character's reaction they're going to be
4:03
trying to get their balance back trying
4:05
to get their footing back it could have
4:06
been a first kiss or it could have been
4:08
a first major attack it could have been
4:10
a first clue that pulls them into a
4:12
mystery and now they have to figure out
4:14
what their plan is and how they're going
4:16
to go on living it could have been an
4:18
actual doorway that they passed through
4:20
this is kind of like what happens in
4:22
Harry Potter the character actually goes
4:24
from living this one type of life to
4:27
getting on the train and heading to
4:30
Hogwarts so it's it's a passage from one
4:34
type of life to another whether it's an
4:36
actual change in location or it's just a
4:39
change of their everyday life is now
4:41
turning into something different that
4:43
first few scenes will be sort of into
4:45
the new world so that's what I have on
4:47
my sheet here the plotting sheet where
4:50
we talk about you know what happens when
4:52
your character moves into this new
4:54
version of their life in one way or
4:56
another because they're stepping outside
4:57
of who they used to be or into some kind
5:00
of unique or different situation
5:02
what Dame Scott Bell says happens next
5:04
and this isn't exactly on my plotting
5:07
sheet but it does come into play as he
5:09
talks about something called the kick in
5:11
the shins so the kick in the shins is
5:13
the character's first real test in the
5:16
death stakes so if the death stakes like
5:18
we talked about are either figurative or
5:20
they're literal but this is the first
5:22
real test now that your character has
5:24
stepped into the new world now they get
5:27
tested and this happens pretty quickly
5:29
usually in the second act so this can
5:32
kind of go in different orders but
5:33
you're always going to have that sort of
5:35
reaction to whatever happened at the end
5:36
of act 1 and then your character is
5:38
going to start to figure out like how do
5:40
I fit into this new world what's my plan
5:42
so it could be like a plan to
5:44
investigate a murder or it could be a
5:46
plan to like okay how am I going to get
5:48
this guy that I'm really interested in
5:49
now or whatever but they start to come
5:51
up with a plan for how they're going to
5:52
live their lives now that things have
5:54
changed and then at some point as
5:55
they're starting to enact this plan
5:57
they'll be tested in some way could be
6:00
just it's mostly just some kind of
6:02
reminder to the reader that there are
6:04
actual stakes here that this isn't all
6:06
fun and games that there is some kind of
6:09
antagonist out there there's some kind
6:11
of conflict that is going to potentially
6:13
harm your character and again this all
6:15
depends on what type of genre you're
6:17
writing so in the plotting sheets what
6:19
we have first is you've got the into the
6:21
new world reaction then the plan your
6:24
character may state their plan or it
6:26
just might be kind of you understand
6:28
what their plan is that their plan is to
6:29
go to Hogwarts and try to figure out how
6:31
to live life now that things have
6:33
changed or it could actually be okay a
6:35
list like it is in my book deep dark
6:37
secrets that we'll go through in a
6:38
little bit
6:39
if here's the things I'm going to do to
6:41
investigate this murder and now I have
6:43
to figure out what happens my friend
6:44
these are the things I'm going to do if
6:46
you think about a movie like Ocean's
6:48
eleven for example they actually go
6:50
through the plan and they assemble the
6:52
team that all happens the first half of
6:54
Act two and assembling the team
6:56
alexandra Sokoloff says and her
6:58
screenwriting tricks for authors is also
7:01
kind of an element of Act two so if you
7:03
have one of those types of stories where
7:05
you assemble a team of people who are
7:08
all going to do something together that
7:09
usually happens in the first half of Act
7:12
two also then the next big thing is
7:14
you're going to have tests and
7:16
challenges and then your character is
7:18
going to react to them now there's no
7:21
hard and fast rule as to what types of
7:23
tests and challenges it's just that your
7:25
character is going to be reacting to
7:27
whatever happened at the end of Act one
7:28
and as they move through the plot as
7:31
they react in whatever way they do as
7:34
they go through their new plan they're
7:36
going to constantly be coming up against
7:38
things that make them uncomfortable that
7:40
test their conflict that trigger their
7:43
internal conflict and that wound that we
7:45
were talking about when we talk about
7:46
writing great characters that is
7:48
constantly going to be tested for
7:50
example since we're talking about Harry
7:52
Potter as Harry Potter is going through
7:54
his new life at Hogwarts he's constantly
7:58
being brought back to this wound of what
8:00
really happened to his parents and why
8:03
did he survive so he's constantly being
8:05
tested in that way especially by
8:07
characters like Draco Malfoy so you're
8:09
going to see those tests and it's going
8:11
to constantly keep coming back up which
8:13
is one of the main reasons that we went
8:14
through the entire process of figuring
8:16
out all those things about your
8:18
character before we started plotting so
8:20
that now you know what kinds of things
8:22
to test your character with and how
8:24
they're going to react because of those
8:25
things that happened to them in their
8:28
past I will show you some more examples
8:30
of this when we go through deep dark
8:31
secrets but there's going to be lots of
8:33
tests and challenges and then your
8:35
character is going to react to them in
8:37
some way and they're constantly going to
8:39
be brought back up against that but
8:41
everything that's happening in this
8:42
section needs to be moving your story
8:45
forward your hero and heroine are
8:47
getting closer together and maybe it's
8:49
kind of those two steps forward three
8:50
steps back kind of thing
8:52
everything is moving us forward in the
8:54
plot so you want to make sure to
8:56
constantly be moving toward whatever you
8:58
know is happening in the midpoint a few
9:00
other elements this is one of the things
9:02
I love about Alexandra so koloff's
9:04
screenwriting tricks for authors is she
9:06
talks about different elements that you
9:08
might find in act 2 so I just wrote a
9:11
few of these down but you do want to
9:13
check out her book for example but she
9:15
says you know you could have training
9:16
sequence so this is another thing like
9:18
Ocean's eleven you have that training
9:20
sequence of you know how they're gonna
9:21
do this they're going through their plan
9:23
they're assembling the team that sort of
9:25
thing
9:25
it could be a series of tests like we
9:27
just talked about there could be new
9:29
allies new people that join the team new
9:31
allies that your heroine or hero meets
9:34
and that's exactly what happens in Harry
9:36
Potter is you've got new allies he meets
9:38
Hermione and he meets Ron and so he's
9:40
getting these new allies also you're
9:42
going to have small attacks by the
9:44
antagonist in in a detective story
9:46
you're going to have things like
9:47
questioning witnesses lining up the
9:49
usual suspects exploring Clues
9:51
investigating you know new things that
9:54
will lead you down different pathways as
9:55
the detective then when we get to about
9:59
40 to 45 percent there's going to be
10:02
something that kam Weiland calls the
10:04
pinch point or I've heard other people's
10:06
just call it an antagonist attack that
10:09
is going to remind the reader like hey
10:11
we're having all this fun like going
10:12
through these process of assembling the
10:14
team and training and doing all these
10:16
things and then there's going to be some
10:17
kind of attack and it could be something
10:19
really big or it could just be kind of
10:21
like an emotional jolt or it could be a
10:23
slight failure but it's got to be
10:25
something that reminds your reader that
10:27
this isn't all fun and games there is an
10:29
antagonist out here that is being a
10:32
danger to your character I'll show you
10:35
how I handled that in deep dark secrets
10:37
and then shortly after the pinch point
10:39
you have the actual midpoint so just
10:41
like it sounds the midpoint is what
10:43
happens in the middle of the book it
10:45
usually happens right around 50% and
10:48
this is something that you know if you
10:50
had that act 1 doorway was something
10:53
that changed the story or character's
10:54
life this is the second plot point the
10:56
second time your character is turned on
10:58
its head or the story is turned on its
11:00
head but this one is bigger I kind of
11:02
think of the midpoint as
11:04
this is something that changes
11:05
everything it changes your whole story
11:07
it could be a huge revelation it could
11:10
be a giant clue it could be something
11:12
that takes your heroin it makes them go
11:14
oh my god I had no idea Alec sokoloff
11:16
says that it could be and now it's
11:18
personal kind of lost something that
11:20
happens that it's like okay I was in
11:22
this but now that this has happened it
11:24
changes everything this is one of the
11:26
things that km Weiland says in her book
11:28
structuring your novel is that in the
11:30
first half of the second act your
11:32
characters mostly reacting and they're
11:34
going through the motions and they're
11:36
constantly like reacting to things and
11:38
after what happens in the midpoint which
11:41
we'll talk about in the second half of
11:42
act 2 your character becomes more
11:44
proactive and they start to take more
11:46
control and that's because of whatever
11:48
happens here at the midpoint the
11:50
midpoint is also something that is sort
11:52
of what you would call a catalyst for
11:54
your main characters to change this is
11:57
what James Scott Bell in his book he has
12:00
two books talking about this one is
12:01
write your story from the middle or
12:03
write your novel from the middle I
12:04
always forget the title of that one and
12:05
the other one is superstructure he talks
12:07
about how a lot of times you will see
12:09
what is called a mirror moment here at
12:11
the midpoint where your character it's
12:13
as if they're looking at a mirror and
12:15
seeing themselves for the first time it
12:16
could be them saying like oh my god what
12:18
have I become
12:19
you could be them looking at everything
12:21
and going there's no way I'm gonna
12:22
survive this so I'm gonna take as many
12:24
people down with me as I can which is
12:26
kind of like Katniss in The Hunger Games
12:27
where she's like okay the odds stacked
12:29
against me are too great but I am going
12:32
to fight this battle with all my heart
12:33
one of the ways I love to look at it
12:35
that he said is it's a change or Die
12:37
moment it's where your character says if
12:38
I don't change I am going to die so
12:40
they're looking right at their death
12:42
sticks and they're realizing for the
12:43
first time that they're going to have to
12:45
change and I love that so it's kind of
12:47
like looking in a mirror seeing yourself
12:49
and saying okay I see this wound I see
12:52
how this wound has affected me and how
12:54
I've been going about this the wrong way
12:55
so you really need to tie in whatever
12:58
happens in the midpoint to that
12:59
emotional side of your character's
13:01
internal journey so that they see what
13:05
it is they need to learn and have needed
13:07
to learn all along and they're not going
13:09
to completely conquer that yet but this
13:12
is the first time that they really see
13:13
it in themselves and again I will show
13:15
you how I handle that in deep dark
13:17
secret
13:17
so hopefully this has made sense to you
13:19
in terms of all the things that happen
13:21
at the beginning of act 2 and now
13:23
showing you how I applied that to my own
13:26
story we'll just give you a little bit
13:27
more example of how you can do this for
13:29
yourself okay so let's take a look at
13:33
the plotting sheet and how I would fill
13:35
it out for my book deep dark secrets and
13:37
again if you don't have this you can go
13:39
to the link below or heart breathing's
13:41
calm slash plot your novel so the first
13:44
part is into the new world now like I
13:46
said this can be an actual change in
13:48
location or it could just be how your
13:50
heroines world is changing our hero's
13:52
world is changing it but it needs to
13:54
include their reaction to what happened
13:55
at the end of act 1
13:57
so for Mariah it's her reaction to the
13:59
letter that she found in her locker it's
14:01
her thoughts and her emotions regarding
14:03
that and then she has a process or scene
14:06
where she goes through everything she
14:07
can remember about that night because
14:08
now she knows that she was not imagining
14:11
it and she further commits to finding
14:14
out the truth then she comes up with her
14:17
plan and in this book it's an actual
14:19
like plan that she writes out and she
14:20
thinks about what she's going to do
14:22
number one she knows she's going to keep
14:24
what she's doing from her family she
14:26
doesn't want them to know because they
14:27
are already thinks that she's very
14:30
fragile regarding this incident she's
14:32
going to investigate the truth which
14:34
means she's gonna ask others what they
14:36
remember she's gonna investigate this
14:38
strange medallion that she's had with
14:39
her ever since the night of the accident
14:41
she's gonna talk to Hayley's mom and she
14:44
knows that number one thing she needs to
14:47
do is get hurt driving privileges back
14:49
because she's gonna need her car to go
14:51
do this investigation now we move into
14:53
the tests and challenges and your
14:56
characters reaction to those tests and
14:58
challenges after she gets her car back
15:01
she goes to see Hayley's mom and this is
15:03
where we have what I was talking about
15:05
with James Scott bell the kick in the
15:07
shins
15:07
where it's the first real test in the
15:10
death stakes now that she's decided she
15:12
is going to find the truth she is tested
15:16
because she goes to Hayley's house and
15:19
finds these strange drawings in the
15:21
closet which her drawings that she had
15:23
drawn herself after a dream and it
15:25
scares her now she knows that she could
15:27
be in danger as well and there's Asli
15:29
actually
15:30
and here as well that I mentioned
15:32
Haley's Journal is missing which will
15:34
come into the story later on another
15:37
part of her investigation and her tests
15:39
and challenges as she researches the
15:41
symbols on line she talks to the coach
15:44
which in a mystery for this this is kind
15:46
of a red herring of is the coach
15:49
involved somehow also she has a moment
15:52
where her powers escalate so Mariah's
15:54
anger seems to physically harm someone
15:57
so now she's got these powers that she
15:59
can't explain she also wants to
16:01
investigate information about the
16:03
strange guy at school that reminds her
16:05
of a guy from her dreams so she asks her
16:07
best friend Nicole for information on
16:10
this guy Jordan and when she can't get
16:12
the information she wants she decides to
16:14
get his school records and she finds out
16:17
that she can get them from her
16:18
ex-boyfriend who works in the school
16:20
office so there's another part of that
16:22
then she investigates the medallion and
16:25
that brings in the lure of the spirit
16:27
walkers and as she's doing all of these
16:29
investigations and all these tests she
16:31
is also you know facing conflict and
16:34
facing her own wound along the way so
16:36
one of the tests here is that she has to
16:38
talk to Troy her ex-boyfriend and face
16:40
her own self another challenge that she
16:43
faces is that her mom is so worried
16:44
about her that she wants to set up a
16:46
meeting with dr. Milner her psychiatrist
16:48
which means now there's a ticking time
16:51
clock she's got one week to figure out
16:52
the truth of what happened so you can
16:54
see here an example of the types of
16:56
tests and challenges and your
16:57
character's reaction now we move on to
16:59
the first pinch point and antagonist
17:01
attack and like I said this is actually
17:03
going to happen towards the end of the
17:05
first half of the second act in my story
17:09
mariah has a run-in with Troy's new
17:11
girlfriend her ex-boyfriends new girl
17:13
and she gets so angry with this girl
17:16
that a dark shadow slithers out from the
17:18
darkness or from you know one of the
17:20
shadows and wraps around this girl's
17:21
boot which is like oh my gosh
17:23
super danger what is happening she's
17:25
really in trouble here so this is the
17:27
pinch point that lets the reader know
17:29
that hey we've been going through this
17:30
investigation but there are there's a
17:32
real death at stake here something
17:33
really bad is going on and then that
17:36
leads us later into the midpoint because
17:38
at that point Mariah decides I've got to
17:40
face this head-on and she makes the
17:42
decision to go back to
17:43
scene of the accident the bridge that
17:45
they drove off and in the process of
17:48
pushing herself to this she remembers a
17:50
lot of things about that night and
17:52
there's a dark shadow reappears and
17:54
urges her to kill herself which she
17:56
almost actually does but Jordan this
17:58
mysterious stranger appears and saves
18:01
her life and some of the truth finally
18:03
comes out that the stranger that night
18:05
was his brother who has also been
18:07
missing for the last year now where this
18:10
ties into what we call the mirror moment
18:12
or what James Scott bell calls the
18:14
mirror moment is that this is a change
18:15
or Die moment for Mariah she says if I
18:18
don't trust him and actually tell who
18:20
the truth here I'm going to lose my life
18:22
to this and I am actually going to die
18:25
so she knows that she has to change and
18:29
that she has to start trusting someone
18:31
and stop lying so much or she's going to
18:34
lose her life all right so that is a
18:36
great look at the elements of the first
18:39
half of Act one and an example of how I
18:41
followed those things in my book deep
18:44
dark secrets as you can see the majority
18:47
of that second act is all of those tests
18:50
and challenges and the character's
18:51
reaction it's the investigation like
18:54
when you have a book like Harry Potter
18:56
it's exploring the new world and all of
18:57
the cool things about the School of
18:59
wizardry and mysteries it's following
19:01
the clues and investigating in a romance
19:03
it may be more like the first date and
19:05
all the things leading up to what in
19:08
romance is often the case at the
19:10
midpoint which is the first time your
19:11
characters make love so you've got
19:13
everything in that first half is the
19:16
reaction and then all these tests and
19:18
things leading up to what is going to
19:20
happen at the midpoint and that is the
19:22
majority of what happens those tests and
19:24
challenges then you've got that
19:25
antagonist attack for the first pinch
19:28
point that reminds the reader hey there
19:30
are real things at stake here there is a
19:32
death at stake and then you've got that
19:34
final midpoint which pretty much changes
19:37
the whole story or turns it on his head
19:38
in the case of deep dark secrets you've
19:40
got mariah finding out that she really
19:43
was not crazy that there is something
19:45
actually going on here and the guy that
19:48
she remembers the guy that handed her
19:50
this medallion in the river that
19:51
everybody told her was made up was
19:54
actually Jordan's brother so now she has
19:56
this
19:57
very unexpected Ally because she thought
19:59
maybe Jordan was someone to be afraid of
20:01
and now he has become her closest ally
20:04
in fact to the point where she has this
20:07
moment where she says if I don't open up
20:10
to him and change this pattern of lying
20:13
to everyone and pretending to be someone
20:14
I'm not
20:15
then whatever this dark mysterious
20:17
forces is going to take my life because
20:20
she almost just died and if it wasn't
20:21
for him she would have died just like
20:23
her friend Haley so that's her mirror
20:26
moment and now what you'll see in the
20:27
second half of act 2 is that she is
20:30
going to take a more active role in the
20:32
story and instead of just reacting to
20:34
everything she's finding out she is
20:35
actually going to try to take control up
20:38
the story and truly get to the bottom of
20:40
what's happening and actually tried to
20:41
save herself so you'll see how that goes
20:43
on in the first half or in the second
20:45
half of act 2 I sincerely hope this has
20:48
helped you if you have any other points
20:50

20:51

guys in my next video bye
21:33
[Music]

hey guys welcome back to heart breathings i'm so glad you're here this is video number five of our how to
0:06
write and plan a series series of videos and today we're going to be talking about something
0:11
that i feel like does not get enough attention which is the emotional aspects of writing your series because there are
0:18
some serious dangers that you might not even be aware of when you first start writing your series
0:23
that can really hold you back so i'm going to talk about what some of these feelings are and what some of the
0:29
emotional pitfalls are as you work through your series and i'm also going to give you some tips and direction on how to get through it when
0:36
you do face it so if you're interested in this topic go ahead and hit the thumbs up subscribe to this channel and make sure
0:42
that you comment down below and let me know if you're enjoying this series of videos and let's get started
0:52
writing of any kind can bring up self-doubt and all kinds of emotional
0:57
issues because it is a very vulnerable thing to basically pour a piece of yourself and
1:04
your experience and your imperfect you know viewpoints and everything else onto the page for other people to judge
1:12
but that's exactly what they do they write reviews they tell other people they buy or fail to buy your next book
1:19
they message you and all of these things begin happening once you start publishing if you are publishing a standalone book
1:26
you know you you spend your time writing that book you're emotionally invested in it but once it's published you can go on to
1:33
write different series different characters a different genre if you'd like the unique thing that happens when you
1:41
decide to take on a series however is that you're making a commitment and you're saying i am going to commit to
1:47
writing this person's story or this town's story or this group of people
1:54
for an extended period of time in my life and of course that is going to vary for everybody who's watching this video
2:00
some people will say i'm going to write a trilogy and it'll be drafted and done in two months but for
2:05
most of us we're going to be saying i commit to this series and we're going to be spending a year
2:10
or heck to be honest i have spent 10 years writing a series and i am still
2:16
two books away from finishing it so you might be dedicating yourself to the next 10 years
2:21
of writing in a single story world and building a single magic system or building a single set of characters
2:27
or writing in one person's point of view for the next decade of your life so the level of commitment might vary
2:34
but some of the emotional aspects or pitfalls that you're going to face are going to be pretty universal so
2:41
let's talk about some of these things that you're going to face and how to get over them when they do appear obviously self-doubt
2:47
is one of the biggest ones and you're going to face that no matter what you're writing standalone non-fiction fiction whatever it is but
SELF-DOUBT
2:55
for some reason when you're writing a series that level of self-doubt can often be
3:01
amplified and the reason i believe that happens is because you're not just creating this one
3:07
package of thing putting it out into the world and then starting fresh you're actually building upon the
3:13
previous thing and as you begin to build the anxiety and the pressure builds as well
3:19
so you might be thinking things like am i really writing something unique enough is my story big enough am i good enough
3:26
how many people are buying my books maybe that's not enough am i doing well i don't know and there's a lot of this
3:32
doubt that starts to come up and in the midst of that doubt you somehow have to harness
3:39
your creativity and get back to work on book two of a series and most of the time now this isn't true
3:47
for all types of series but it's definitely true with a dynamic series is that the second book the third book
3:54
the fourth book they just get harder and harder as you go because the story gets more complex the
4:00
world gets bigger and every book is building upon this foundation so by the time you get to book four or
4:06
five you've got like 300 000 words worth of character arc that you're building on
4:11
and so you have to up the stakes you have to make it better you have to make it flashier you have to make the twists
4:16
even better and that can really amplify your self-doubt if you're writing a romance series
4:21
you might get a little bit of that fresh start because you've got a new couple every time but maybe you're facing pressures of
4:28
it's got to be a little bit sexier i've got to make the conflict even better people are really loving these brothers
4:33
so this next brother really has to be like the best character arc out of all of them people have been waiting for his
4:39
story the whole time i have to live up to the hype so every type of series has its own
4:44
unique challenges because every book adds a little bit more expectation
4:50
and a little bit more pressure on how good that book needs to be and you might be facing a couple of
4:57
different types of pressure because on one hand your series might not be selling very well at all
5:02
so now you've got the pressure of oh my gosh i have put so much time and money and energy into
5:08
the series and i'm on book two or three and i'm not seeing the type of return i want to see
5:14
so then the self-doubt starts to creep in of is this going to be worth it am i going to make enough money am i
5:20
going to be able to continue to write am i ever going to be a full-time author and all of those little things will start
5:26
going off in your head and the more books you write without seeing the return you want the louder
5:31
those voices are going to get in your head and that is going to make it even harder to keep writing to keep working
5:38
on that and to keep committing however i could not even tell you the number of
5:43
authors i know that they didn't start selling a good deal of books in their series until they
5:49
were on book four or five or six or even one author i know was barely making any money until she hit book
5:55
seven in her series and that's when it really started to take off and after that she made over a million
6:00
dollars on that series but when she was around book three or four she was not seeing a lot of sales
6:06
and she almost gave up she almost quit because it was so difficult to imagine
6:12
why is she putting all of this time and energy into a series that isn't selling at the rate she wants it to sell but if
6:19
she had given up think of what she might have lost in terms of number of fans and you know sometimes it's a gradual
6:26
build with when you're writing in indie publishing so just be aware that you might have to push
6:31
through that self-doubt to get to the moment where it does become worth it or even just to get to the point where
6:37
you have gained enough knowledge and skill that you're ready to start over on the
6:42
flip side however maybe your first couple of books did so well or the first eight books in your series
6:49
did so well that you're feeling the pressure of i've got thousands of people waiting for this
6:55
book is it gonna be good enough their their expectations are too high and i'm not sure i can live
7:01
up to it so whether your book could series is doing really well or not doing well at all
7:07
you're still going to face a lot of that pressure and self-doubt so what can you do about it one thing i
7:13
can't stress enough is that you need to come into this business of being a series writer
7:20
understanding that your mindset and your mental health and your attitude is a constant work in
7:25
progress and you should be working on the mental health aspects of your career
7:31
just as much as you're working on the craft of your writing and the branding and the marketing
7:37
because it all goes hand in hand because you could have the best branding in the world but if the pressures of writing this
7:43
series become too great you're just going to fall apart and get burned out anyway so you need to make sure that all of
7:49
these things are working together yeah work on your branding get better as an author continue to work on your craft
7:55
but consider your mental health and your confidence and your ability to keep going despite
8:00
what else is happening on the outside world or what people are saying about you or what your sales numbers are continue
8:07
to understand that you are a unique human being no one in the world can write the same types of
8:13
stories you are and you have something special to bring to the world so continue to work on that level of
8:19
confidence so that when the negative thoughts come up you can say i i know what's happening i'm just
8:26
scared all of these negative feelings and emotions are just coming from fear and i am going to refocus on what i love
8:34
most about the story and about the writing which means that sometimes when it comes
8:39
to you know that example that i was talking about about like not selling very many books versus selling a ton it means that you also
8:46
need to search within yourself for some reason as to why you're doing this beyond just
8:51
the money or the fame and the fortune and the usa today bestseller list or how you're going to make yourself
8:57
look to other people it can be really motivational to want to hit those lists
9:02
to make a lot of money and all that stuff and you know hey there may be people out there that are doing this just for the money but eventually
9:09
something has to give because you cannot keep going on a story or career that is difficult
9:17
unless you've got some reason behind wanting to do it besides just making money because in my opinion that's never going to be
9:24
enough not not long term anyway it's nice but it's not enough because
9:29
the pressures will continue to build including the financial pressures on your series by the way another
9:34
side to the coin of self-doubt is comparison so this is another thing that
CONSTANT COMPARISON
9:40
you might find yourself starting to do more and more the further you get into writing your
9:46
series because now instead of just having one book to compare to all these other
9:51
writers you have a body of work that you're comparing to someone else's body of work or many
9:57
other people's bodies of work and the more you invest the more time you invest the more
10:03
seems to be at stake for you so as you start trying to figure out how am i doing is
10:08
this worth it am i doing well do people like me is you know is this something i could keep going on you are naturally
10:15
just as a human being who is vulnerable and emotional probably going to start
10:21
looking outside yourself in your own series and community for proof of whether you're doing well
10:27
or not and that means you might find yourself getting into some sort of loop
10:32
of comparing yourself to others so you might be in a facebook group where people are constantly sharing their
10:37
numbers or how much money they made or what marketing they're doing or what ranking they are at amazon
10:42
and then over here you might end up with you're just taking yourself like
10:48
watching those people and going through their uh instagram and seeing if they have more followers than
10:53
you or seeing if they have better marketing tactics than you or looking to see what their ranking is
10:59
compared to your series and how many times have they had a book bub and there are a million things that you could check do
11:05
they have more reviews than me are they putting out more books than i am are they writing so much faster and why
11:10
and if i could only be more like them maybe i would be more successful and this is a very dangerous
11:17
mental trap when it comes to writing a series because you've got to get that next book out the
11:24
single most important thing you can do for yourself and your very best marketing tool as a series writer is
11:30
always your first book in the series and your next book in the series the one that
11:36
hasn't come out yet so you can always focus on you know bringing people into your series through that very first
11:42
entry book right but your best marketing tool
11:48
is that next book and if you are so caught up in the mental trap of comparing yourself to other people
11:54
and really what that is is looking for proof that you're not good enough if you're constantly looking for that
11:59
proof that you're not good enough and wanting those numbers to be higher and wondering why you're not good enough and
12:05
looking you know allowing and indulging yourself in that negative like self-talk then you're not writing
12:11
that next book and you're going to naturally be less successful than you could have been
12:16
because you're taking so much time putting your energy into comparing and self-doubt and
12:22
negative talk so one of the best things that you can do for yourself is pay attention to whether you're starting to engage in
12:29
some of those comparison loops are you checking other people's reviews are you looking at other people's
12:34
rankings are you you know comparing your branding to other people and are you spending a considerable
12:40
amount of time in facebook groups or author communities where you're comparing yourself to other people's numbers
12:46
or beating yourself up over the fact that maybe your numbers aren't as good as someone else because if you start engaging in those
12:52
types of activities quite often you might even just not even realize how addicted you're getting to
12:59
those behaviors and to that negativity because in a way sometimes
13:05
beating ourselves up or procrastinating or telling ourselves that we're not good enough is a way of avoiding
13:12
the act of putting ourselves out there it's almost like a comfort zone that
13:18
comparison can feel like a security blanket even though it's like an itchy blanket that like just
13:24
stinks it's something that we sometimes will wrap around ourselves because we're so scared of how we measure up we're so
13:32
scared of putting ourselves out there and actually finding success so we just continue with that behavior
13:38
so one thing that you can do to counteract that and my biggest tip for you when it comes to this
13:43
is to be very mindful about your behaviors who are you hanging out with online what types of activities are you
13:49
doing why are you going and looking at what everybody else is doing it's great to get inspiration from other people
13:55
but when you start to see that it's a way to compare yourself to others you've got to stop it right away
14:00
because it is going to lead you into a dark valley of no return and it is a very dangerous place to
14:06
allow yourself to be and especially when you're writing a series of books you need to keep going you need to keep
14:13
that energy going in a positive direction because as we're going to talk about in this video there are a lot of other obstacles that
14:21
you're going to face and you cannot afford for comparison to be one of them okay so let's talk about another uh
14:27
emotional aspect of series writing and that is it sometimes is the child of self-doubt
SHINY OBJECT SYNDROME
14:34
but that is shiny object syndrome this is a problem for a lot of us because what
14:40
happens is something like this you get that initial spark of excitement oh my gosh
14:45
this idea is so much fun i love it i love these characters i can't wait to explore it
14:50
let's get started so you start writing in that world you start developing things you start
14:55
maybe even publish a few books in the in the series and then at some point it gets hard
15:03
it gets hard for a number of reasons one of them is one we're going to talk about in just a minute which is i'm kind of
15:08
bored and i'm overwriting this world i'm burned out on it but another reason is that it's just too
15:14
difficult it's getting complex the stakes are constantly being raised you don't have any other like really
15:20
great ideas another emotional issue with writing a series is that maybe you had these grand ideas and it's just
15:27
not coming out on paper the way that you envisioned it to be or
15:32
the sales aren't as good so that could be another thing playing into it and you just will start to your you know
15:39
you you will start to lose that sort of shiny newness of the series you've been
15:44
writing and it will start to take on these more darker emotional tones like the self-doubt
15:50
the comparison the boredom or the burnout the just not i'm not getting that same
15:56
adrenaline rush when i sit down to work on it because the series is getting harder the story is getting harder the
16:01
sales aren't coming in or for a number of reasons it's like now it's getting down to the actual
16:07
hard work of keeping this commitment going and suddenly this new idea will come to
16:13
you and it will be like oh my gosh i want to write that i want to go play in the writers playground
16:19
and that new idea has all these possibilities maybe that idea would sell better you
16:24
know what maybe that idea would be more fun maybe even it's more than just a new idea maybe it's a whole new genre or a
16:30
whole new pen name and you can convince yourself that that shiny object is so much more alluring than this rusty
16:37
old series bucket that you've been working on for the last five years and trying to build now sometimes it is time to say goodbye
16:45
to a series and we'll talk about that in just a few minutes when i get to the burnout section but a lot of times you need to stop and
16:52
ask yourself why am i feeling this need for shiny object syndrome
16:58
is it because the story's just getting too hard and i'm avoiding it if you find that you're procrastinating
17:03
and you're just not writing that next book not because the ideas aren't coming or not because it's
17:09
not exciting but because you literally just cannot force yourself to sit down and work on it and you don't know why
17:14
it's just this like invisible resistance and you're hearing the siren song of that new idea then
17:20
most likely it's just fear it's some kind of irrational oh my gosh i'm so scared
17:27
because this isn't going the way i wanted or i'm afraid i'm not going to be able to end that series the way that everyone expects or
17:34
i've got all these other pressures and so there's something exciting about
17:39
the new and the easy it seems like it's going to be easy but i guarantee you
17:44
this even if you go and you start writing that shiny new thing
17:50
it eventually is going to become a rusty old series bucket as well
17:55
it is eventually going to get difficult and complex and emotionally like burdened
18:03
so even when you look to that shiny new idea it can look really good and shiny right
18:08
now but just know that eventually after two or three books in that series you're going to be right
18:14
back where you were with series number one which is a place of looking for the next
18:19
thing now we're going to talk about this more on sunday in my video
18:24
on some of the biggest mistakes that i have made so this will be video number six in the series is coming out this
18:30
sunday because i want to discuss really some of the biggest
18:36
things i wish i had not done so that i can help you avoid some of these pitfalls and one of them for me is i wish that
18:43
when i had hit a difficult part in my series i wish i had kept going and forced myself
18:49
through in a way like kept trying new things because what i ended up doing was
18:56
pretty much embracing the shiny new object every time and what that led to was five series going at once and as
19:04
someone who is not a super super crazy fast writer that meant i could at most write one
19:10
book in each series a year and then that meant everything was going slower than it should and there's
19:16
i've got that pressure that you feel that i'm talking about for that one series multiplied by five and so even though i
19:23
was like having fun with the shiny new idea eventually just became super super heavy i don't know if i'm
19:29
explaining that really well because it's something from my own experience but just know that you're going to
19:36
emotionally face this challenge of this current series that i'm writing
19:41
is really hard or i'm tired of it or it's just not as exciting as it used to
19:46
be and then this magical new idea that is really shiny and exciting is going
19:52
to come to you and most of the time it is just your fear talking
19:59
it is just this need for the adrenaline and for the newness of the story but it is also something that is going
20:06
to probably cause you more harm than good and this is something you'll have to
20:11
decide at on an individual level whether or not it's a good time to
20:16
embrace the shiny new idea because you need the like sort of adrenaline shot of something new
20:22
or if you need to just really keep working and i can't really tell you what to do because it's very personal
20:28
whether or not you should go for the shiny new idea but one piece of advice that i would like to give you is this instead of just
20:35
in the moment thinking this is what i need to do is write this new idea i desperately need it right now i need
20:40
this new feeling is actually sit down and think about how does this play out
20:47
six months from now how does this play out a year from now and really look at how you're going to
20:52
incorporate this shiny new idea especially if it's a new series idea into your overall writing schedule
20:59
if i had done this i could have saved myself a lot of time and heartache but
21:06
it's more than just the allure of that new idea you have to figure out how are you going to weave that new idea
21:11
in to your overall publishing strategy and if it's going to hurt you more than
21:17
it will help you then something you might consider is indulging in a shiny new idea
21:22
like a novella or a short story just something to get you writing again that makes you excited again
21:27
that isn't such a huge commitment of like now i'm gonna take on another five book series in addition to my five other
21:34
long series that are happening yeah i have made some mistakes okay a
21:39
few more to address one is i can't do this anymore it's too complex
21:45
this is a practical problem as well as an emotional problem but sometimes it's really just fear and
Emotional Pitfall #4
21:51
so if you are writing a longer series in particular if you're writing a longer series that builds with each book
21:58
like a dynamic series like we've talked about it's possible that you will hit a point
22:03
where you have written yourself into a corner where the character arcs have nowhere to go where you just can't
22:10
figure out how they're going to beat this villain because he's too powerful or your magic system wasn't built properly
22:17
because as much as we would love for our ideas to come to us perfectly formed and for us to make all the right
22:23
choices and be this omniscient writer person who's like perfect we're gonna probably make mistakes and as
22:30
you're building a series especially if it's your first series you're gonna probably do things that you
22:35
wish you hadn't done and now that they're out there it's very difficult to change them especially when
22:40
it comes to plot points so there have been a couple of times in my shadow demon saga where i've written
22:46
something and then gone back and been like oh my gosh why did i do that because i hadn't
22:51
plotted far enough ahead i'm realizing oh my gosh this doesn't work for my story but i can't go back
22:57
and have 10 000 people that already read it re-read it so i have to keep the story and the plot
23:04
line you know whatever happened is what happened that is the truth of my series now so that has caused delays in my writing
23:12
because i've had to figure out a way around it so if you can plot ahead as much as
23:18
possible so that you're thinking through every book before you publish it and where is this storyline
23:23
going why am i writing it this way that might save you some problems but sometimes you're just gonna have things
23:29
that you realize after the fact that were mistakes so how do you handle that emotionally
23:34
when you start to get this feeling of i can't do this anymore this is getting too complex it's too hard
23:40
what have i gotten myself into well the biggest advice that i have for you is to
23:45
continue to learn to study the craft and the art of writing so that you do get better
23:51
plus when you hit some of those walls the best thing you can do is dive right back into a really good craft book
23:58
because those writers are going to guide you through the plot and you're going to maybe spark some new ideas
24:04
another thing that you can do when you feel like i just can't do this is too complex is to go back if you did use that series
24:11
workbook that i gave you guys a couple of weeks ago and you wrote out like your favorite genres and other things that
24:17
inspire you go back and watch those movies read those books and just open your mind to the possibilities of
24:24
what you need to do in your series but mostly my biggest advice to you when you feel
24:30
stuck or you feel like it's gotten too hard is don't procrastinate and avoid
24:35
thinking about your series instead get into action read the book
24:40
watch your inspiring movies start talking to somebody else about it start writing the book even if you know
24:46
the story is crap and you made a big mistake because the worst thing you can do is to just be like frozen uh it's too
24:55
hard i've made these mistakes i'm gonna just like go into my closet and like never touch
25:01
this story again because you're going to regret it and the faster you can get into action and start dealing with whatever complexities
25:07
or problems are there the better it's going to be and it might be painful because you're going to want to procrastinate
25:13
you're going to want to avoid that work as much as possible but if your story is feeling too complex
25:20
you've got to rise to meet the challenge you can either find a way to simplify the story in some way like oh well why
25:25
don't i just do this or you can start talking through the idea with someone else or
25:31
you can rise to the challenge and increase your own skill and just get better as a writer
25:36
and sometimes that is what a series is going to ask of you which is not only a technical and skill practical
25:43
issue of writing a series it is an emotional issue because it's like the game of writing a series is going to
25:50
demand that you level up to write the next book and that is really really tough because you have to work
25:57
through all your own self-doubts you have to work through all of your own things that like self-sabotage
26:03
and mental health issues that have been holding you back your whole life and it can be really tough to face those
26:10
while you're trying to pour your heart onto the page but i have had to do it with multiple books that i've written that
26:15
i've hit this limit i've hit this place where i'm like i can't do this anymore it's too hard
26:20
and instead of giving up i have had to look it straight in the face and say okay book you're giving me trouble but i
26:28
am going to conquer this one way or another right now i'm facing this with book three in my eternal
26:34
sorrow series i have been working on this book for years and i've just had such a struggle and
26:39
what i have learned myself right now over the past couple of weeks is that the more i avoid it
26:46
the more stressed i become and the more i want to avoid it so the only thing that has been helping
26:51
me is to get into action i created a big outlining wall so that i can see it i got excited by using like colored
26:57
post-it notes and colored pens and i reread the books and i started making notes and even though i didn't have the
27:03
answers i faced the fear and i got into motion and instead of procrastinating or avoiding it anymore
27:10
i started working and now the ideas are starting to come so when you face this part of it just
27:16
get moving again however you have to do it just keep moving forward a flip side to this coin of i
27:22
can't do it it's too hard is potentially at some point in your series you might also hit a point of
CDON'T WANT TO WRITE THIS ANYMORE\ BURNOUT
27:29
i don't want to do this anymore i'm burned out i'm tired of these characters i need
27:34
something new and this is what i was talking about earlier with the shiny object syndrome is like sometimes
27:40
your soul is actually calling for you to do something different because you've kind of tapped yourself out with this
27:46
particular story world and you just need to refill your creative well before
27:51
you can get back to it or before you can you know breathe new life into that series so that's why i'm saying it's a
27:58
very personal thing but this is why it's also important to get to know yourself even better
28:03
throughout the process of being a writer and to always be working on your mental health so that you can understand the difference between when
28:09
you just need to refill your creative well and you're just burned out and when a story is getting too hard
28:17
and that's why you're avoiding it or when a story is really just done and you're just done with it like
28:24
you've told your share of it you're tired of these brothers you're tired of this small town this detective
28:30
has solved his last case and now it is time to put it to an end some of the emotional
28:37
issues with that are as follows one what you might face is that your series
28:43
is doing so incredibly well that even though you are emotionally done with it
28:49
it is also providing the majority of your income this can be really really tricky on an
28:54
emotional level as well as a financial level because what if the next thing you write
29:00
doesn't do as well or it takes you five years to build that new series up this is a real real issue and these are
29:07
real fears but what kind of cost is it going to have to you personally to continue
29:12
writing a series you're just done with and i think that we all as readers could point to series where we
29:18
can tell the author was just their heart wasn't in it anymore and it lost some of the magic that it had in
29:24
the beginning and that is heartbreaking as a reader and maybe that author still continued to
29:30
make bank maybe they still made thousands if not millions of dollars off that series but once it starts to lose that magic
29:37
it's no fun for the writer and it's no fun for the reader anymore so in some ways my
29:43
advice to you would be quit while you're ahead if you're feeling burned out on something
29:48
think about ways that you can keep the income and the excitement going but also refill your own creative well
29:54
one option is you can tell your fans you know what i'm stepping away from this best-selling series for
30:00
a little while and i'm going to try something new and just communicate with them and be like i'm doing the best i
30:05
can but i need this for my own mental health some people are going to understand some people are going to not understand
30:11
but you have to be true to yourself then take some time away write something that refills your well
30:16
that gets you excited and start something new and then come back to that old series and finish it up
30:22
especially if you know you're done with it try to wrap it up with an ending that makes sense that stays true to the story and is aligned with your
30:29
personal values and then move on but i just want you to be aware that even if a series is doing
30:34
really well you might someday face the emotional side of i'm ready to be done with it but it's
30:41
also the majority of my income something else you might want to do is write a spin off so i was feeling burned out on my demon
30:48
series but i still wanted that was still so much of my income so much of what my fans were
30:54
wanting me to write plus i knew i still had more to write in that world but i was just burned out on harper
31:00
for a little while and so i wrote a spin-off series it was called sacrifice me and it did
31:05
extremely well sold something like 36 000 copies of that series in the first six months because
31:11
i was so excited about it and the fans felt that excitement and that energy that went into it then i
31:16
was able to go back to my shadow demon saga and write the next book and pour my energy back into
31:22
it so find a way to either get yourself really excited about the series or the world again by writing spin-offs or
31:28
novellas or short stories or side stories and then come back to it but if you find
31:33
that your heart's just not there anymore don't be afraid to let go and just rebuild because your mental health and
31:40
your emotional well-being is more important than that check that's coming in and i know that's
31:45
more complicated than i'm making it sound but it's also the truth another side to that of
31:50
feeling burned out on it is maybe you're getting burned out on the series and you're also sitting here thinking
31:56
i'm not making any money at all on this and by book six and you've been writing this for three years
32:01
you're just so over not getting good reviews on it and again this is going to be a very personal decision i have seen people
32:09
continue to you know hold out on a series that they think eventually it's going to start making money
32:14
and it never does and they're just want to quit writing at that point because they're so burned out but i've
32:20
also seen people hold on for that one next book and then hit the jackpot like a lottery win
32:26
with finally letting that series build up i think in the end when it comes to this emotional burnout
32:32
the best thing that you can do for yourself is step away when you start to feel the
32:37
burnout happening and you're bored with your series world you're tired of writing it you're burned out on working so hard or burned out on not
32:44
seeing the results you want or whatever it is that's causing the burnout take a step back and try to refill your
32:50
well any way that you can take a vacation take a month off spend some time on a new type of
32:57
project do some painting or some zentangle or something really fun or pick up a new series world a new
33:03
genre that you're writing just for fun even if you're not sure where it fits into your overall publishing plan just do
33:10
something that begins to refill your creative well however best serves you at the time then
33:15
when you're done with that like month or week or whatever amount of time you took off or your side story or whatever come back to that
33:23
original series and really assess how you're feeling about it am i invested in this still is there
33:30
more story to tell here or am i just done and the more you
33:35
listen to yourself instead of listening to what other people are telling you because you might have friends that are saying things that
33:42
are counterproductive to what you need to hear the most important thing you can do is refill the well so you're not so
33:48
exhausted take a break whatever you need to do and then come back to it with fresh eyes and then really assess
33:54
your gut feeling about it do you want to write this or not and when you ask yourself that question
34:00
do i want to write this next book does it feel like your body does this or
34:05
is it like ah yeah i'm excited again i'm ready or is it like oh god i cannot even
34:11
stomach the idea of writing another book with these brothers i can't do it
34:16
and pay attention to that in yourself and then make the decision that's best for you i hate for anybody to abandon a series
34:23
so do the best you can to your fans because you do have a commitment to them once you started a series especially if it's a dynamic
34:30
series so stay in communication with them and that's what we're going to talk about for the last um the last aspect of this
34:36
but really assess your own emotional reaction to it once you've had a break
34:42
and then stay true to that as best you can the final emotional aspect that we're going to talk about today is the
34:48
fact that you're going to start to have fans and they're going to have potentially
34:53
some really strong feelings about your series and those feelings can have an
I'M DISAPPOINTING MY FANS
34:58
emotional toll i face this on a daily basis and it gets really difficult so this is true
35:04
for whether you have very few fans or if you have hundreds and thousands of fans sometimes fans are
35:11
not going to like the direction that you're taking the story they might not like your choices another thing they might not like is the
35:17
speed at which you're coming out with books this is a big problem for me i had to take some break after a
35:22
miscarriage and then a pregnancy and a move and working on heart breathings and my books are not coming out super
35:28
fast and there are a lot of fans that have some very definite feelings about this and in
35:34
to be honest the majority of my fans are extremely supportive and they just want me to be healthy
35:40
and to continue writing at the pace that makes sense for me but there are very handful of very vocal
35:46
fans that will say things like i hate you you're worthless you're you know you're being a terrible author i will never buy
35:53
anything by you again i'm going to tell everybody to never buy anything by you again and that can take
35:58
an emotional toll and series writers get this worse than anyone because people are waiting for that next
36:05
book and i happen to write cliffhangers so i am leaving those readers for two years
36:11
sitting on a cliffhanger and i know that it's an emotional issue for them but
36:17
you also as the author are dealing with these various emotional sides of writing a series and
36:22
living your life in the process and when you start to get this negative feedback
36:28
and even strong words hurled at you for how fast or slow you're going on your series
36:33
that can take an emotional toll another part of the fan side of it is that sometimes you're
36:39
gonna have a series that is so popular that that's the only thing your fans want from you and i know that i've
36:45
come across a lot of friends of mine that have this issue where it's like they have this one best-selling series but
36:50
they cannot get their fans to buy into this next series or this other genre or this next
36:56
thing they're writing and all their fans ever ask them is when are you going to write more harper and jackson
37:01
when are you going to write this next couple how about you write the kids of these couples that i really love and there will be a lot of emotional
37:07
things tied in there especially if you as the author decided you were very done with this series you
37:13
were burned out on it you didn't want to write it anymore and yet you constantly continue to receive emails about why aren't you
37:19
writing more in this i want to hear this why don't you do this write this write this and it can start to feel really difficult and the anxiety
37:27
that can build within you when you don't feel like you're living up to your fans expectations
37:32
can be crippling one thing that you can do is communicate with your fans this has
37:38
helped me a lot and this might depend on your personality and how open you want to be but i am happy with the results every
37:45
time i go on my blog or i go on youtube or instagram stories or newsletter and i tell my fans look
37:52
here's what i'm going through emotionally this is what i'm working on next this is why i've had problems
37:58
i am just being upfront with you here's what you can expect and a lot of fans really appreciate that
38:03
they just want some kind of update instead of just like avoiding them forever because for a long time
38:08
i was so scared of negative feedback that i just wouldn't communicate with my fans and i personally have found for me the
38:15
more open i am with my communication the more authentic and sincere i am about what i'm going through or how i'm
38:20
feeling the better the response from fans another thing on the flip side that you can do though
38:26
is you can also limit people's access directly to you so that might mean you have someone else
38:32
screening your emails so that you don't see those nasty messages those just get deleted you have someone else screening your
38:38
comments on your facebook page or your blog or you have someone screening replies to
38:44
your newsletter and you're not checking your reviews okay so maybe you don't want to read your reviews for a while if you're
38:49
getting some negative feedback from fans and sometimes when you limit that access and you kind of build
38:55
a little bubble around yourself you can communicate to them but just don't let them communicate to you without some
39:00
kind of filter so that you're not seeing those really nasty messages because the truth is all it's going to
39:06
do is add anxiety to your life and it's not going to help you nobody who's telling you that they hate you and you're not
39:11
writing fast enough is going to help you their feedback is not something you need to hear and the other thing that i would say
39:18
that is the best uh thing that has worked for me when it comes to feeling like
39:24
you've got a lot of pressure and demand from fans is to always go back to gratitude and to understand
39:31
that the fans that are unhappy with what you're doing are usually a vocal minority and that if
39:37
you really look at the overall of your your sales your reviews your
39:42
community the people in your groups the people that are following your newsletter the majority of them love what you're
39:48
doing and as long as you stay true to your own joy and your own excitement for the story
39:53
and you follow the path that you see in your head as the writer and creator then you're doing the right thing and
40:00
you can't please everybody you're nev none of us are gonna please every single reader you'd be reaching
40:05
for some level of perfection that is unattainable and instead you can just follow your own
40:11
joy and be true to the story in the best way you know how and that is just gonna have to be enough
40:17
in the end one of the best things that i have found to help me with the emotional aspects of
40:22
writing a series but over the course of the last decade of my publishing career is when i start to notice that i've got
40:30
these negative thoughts and i'm procrastinating and i'm really letting it get to me is to remind myself of three things
40:38
one that it's okay to take a step back and to stop listening to outside feedback that it's okay to step
40:46
back refill my well get excited about the story again and do what i need to do
40:51
to be mentally stable and okay with what's going on with my series my sales and my life in general it's not
40:58
going to ruin your career you're not going to miss out on having a great career for the rest of your life
41:03
because you took a month off or even a year off if you need it and that's the only way you're going to continue to produce in the future
41:10
take the time that you need it's okay number two reminding myself that i'm gonna get
41:16
better at this asking myself to be perfect is in is impossible and unattainable but
41:23
as long as i'm committed to putting my best foot forward then i am going to be okay there is no
41:29
catastrophe that is going to befall me if this story is not 20 times better than the previous one
41:35
you just need to keep writing and get into motion whenever you start to feel those negative self-doubt start to take over
41:42
stop procrastinating get into action and get moving because the only way you're going to
41:47
learn and get better is if you continue to write and so that's something i always remember and if possible
41:54
bring yourself back to that little kernel and spark of joy this is why dragonflies are so important
42:00
to me if you want to watch that video i'll link it for you down below but dragon flies are important to me because
42:05
they're it's like a spirit animal reminder that i should always be focused on my own joy
42:10
and instead of listening to what everybody else is saying or even what my own brain is saying to me
42:16
as long as i get back to that place of joy everything's gonna work out and it's all gonna be okay
42:21
and the third thing that i'm constantly trying to remind myself of is that while i may not be perfect i
42:28
am unique and i have a special perspective a special way with words my
42:34
own voice my own creativity that nobody else in the entire world has access to i am the only person who can
42:41
tell these stories exactly the way that i can tell them and so when i start to face self-doubt
42:48
comparison my sales aren't big enough i'm burned out or any of these other emotional pitfalls or dangers
42:54
i try to bring myself back to this place of confidence where i say i may not be perfect i'm certainly not
43:01
the best writer that ever lived but i am unique i am valuable and i do have something to
43:09
contribute so just remind yourself of that too because it's just as true for you
43:14
as it is for me as it is for every single person who is willing to take the time
43:19
to put their heart to paper because you have a unique perspective you have a
43:25
unique voice even though it may feel like oh other people have written this genre before
43:30
no one has ever written it the way that you can write it so if you don't put that out into the
43:35
world no one ever will and the world will miss out on that thing so don't allow self-doubt to get you down because
43:42
you're unique and you're special and you are worthy of this amazing career all right you guys i hope this video has
43:48
helped you i hope that you'll come back and watch it when you do face these things on your own because these are things that are normal these are doubts
43:55
that we all face and i could really talk about this even more so maybe i'll do a part two of this
44:00
video a little bit down the road but i hope you found it helpful let me know down in the comments which one of
44:05
these you have faced yourself and if you have any other tips for the community of how you've gotten over
44:11
them in the past also if this sort of teaching and understanding the mental health aspect
44:17
of writing as well as the planning and marketing and branding really interests you and resonates with
44:23
you i really hope that you'll consider coming to join my publish and thrive course it opens on

45:37
you in sunday's video all right bye
45:52
[Music]
45:59
you
I'm switching things up!
0:18
hey
0:18
so i'm writing a new book except that
0:21
it's not really a new book so back in
0:24
2019 i was pregnant with evie and i was
0:29
heading into my third trimester and
0:30
coming off of a year 2018 where i was
0:34
the most productive i had ever been i
0:35
started this youtube channel i
0:38
wrote and published five different books
0:40
and i was really looking for something
0:42
during that kind of
0:44
brain fog period of pregnancy that would
0:47
really ignite my creativity and just be
0:49
fun to write so i started working on a
0:52
book that is a standalone sort of young
0:55
adult mystery slash horror that is kind
0:58
of in the same vein of
1:00
i know what you did last summer or
1:02
pretty little liars or if you are an og
1:05
christopher pike fan like you know that
1:07
i am
1:08
that kind of story and i had three in
1:12
mind it was going to be a trio of sort
1:14
of ghost story type books that are all
1:17
mysteries and the first of those was
1:20
called the disappearance of vanessa shaw
1:23
and i actually wrote 20 000 words in
1:26
this book and expected it to be between
1:28
60 and 75 000 words at the time i think
1:31
now it's going to be more on that 75 000
1:34
because i'm adding some points of view
1:36
and who knows maybe a little bit more
1:38
but i didn't quite finish the project
1:40
before evie was born and then of course
1:42
as soon as she was born i felt this
1:44
obligation to work on my current series
1:47
and existing series and did not get a
1:49
chance to go back to this story
1:52
but
1:53
this story is on my mind all the time
1:55
there are actually three stories like i
1:57
said um they're not connected but
1:59
they're similar type of genre and one is
2:02
called the haunting of luna day which i
2:03
also have about 15 000 words written on
2:06
that one and i think about these stories
2:08
a lot they're twisty they're mysteries
2:10
they're really fun this particular book
2:12
the disappearance of vanessa shaw is a
2:15
alternate timeline like a alternating
2:18
timeline kind of story so some of it is
2:20
happening in the present and some of the
2:22
story is catching us up to the night
2:25
that vanessa disappeared and i love this
2:27
kind of story i love reading them i get
2:29
so excited about them but of course when
2:32
you are a professional author and you
2:34
are in the middle of series there are
2:37
things that people expect from you like
2:39
getting those next series books out as
2:41
quickly as you can and so for the past
2:44
few years i have been trying to get
2:46
those books done i published book three
2:47
of eternal sorrows series and if you
2:49
watched the nanowrimo diaries two years
2:51
ago
2:52
you know how difficult that was for me
2:53
but i pushed through and published that
2:55
third book and then i went back and
2:57
worked on book 11 of my shadow demon
2:59
saga which i also published in about a
3:02
year ago in 2021
3:04
but then
3:06
everything kind of fell apart many of
3:08
you know i had some personal kind of
3:10
attacks going on in my personal life we
3:12
lost our house in charleston and then we
3:15
lost our rental house and we ended up
3:17
deciding to go on the road and try to
3:19
find a new place for our family and i
3:22
think that a year later now that we've
3:24
been settled in a new house for about
3:26
six months i'm starting to gain some
3:28
perspective on just how stressful that
3:31
period of my life was it was fun i'm
3:34
grateful for it i know that it was an
3:36
adventure that i will never forget it
3:37
brought our family very close together
3:39
to be together homeschooling and just i
3:42
know i'll cherish that time forever but
3:45
as much as i had hoped traveling would
3:47
ignite my creativity i felt so locked in
3:52
to working on book 12 of my series
3:54
because that is what i'm supposed to be
3:55
working on and it just turned out
3:58
that all the stress that i was in was
4:01
simply not the right atmosphere for me
4:04
to be working on the 12th book which
4:06
really ends up being the 17th book in
4:08
this world of a series i've been writing
4:10
for over a decade of my life it's too
4:12
complex there are too many threads that
4:14
need to come together there's so many
4:16
decisions that need to be made that are
4:19
based on you know
4:21
the past and you know it has this
4:23
pressure of it's the final decision this
4:26
is where i leave my characters forever
4:28
for all eternity and i want to make it
4:31
the best possible book that it can be
4:33
and i know that i'm excited to write it
4:37
i have lots of ideas for it i have
4:38
written
4:39
and thrown away
4:41
tens of thousands of words and then
4:43
written again and so forth and i had
4:46
this realization while reading an
4:48
article lately that was a conversation
4:50
between neil gaiman and victoria schwab
4:53
v.e schwab who wrote the
4:55
um the invisible life of addie larue
4:58
which is just simply brilliant all of
4:59
her books are brilliant that i've read
5:01
and this was from tor con in 2020 they
5:04
were talking and neil gaiman asked ve
5:07
schwab how long it took her to write
5:09
the invisible life of addie larue and
5:12
she said that she had kind of let it
5:13
marinate for about 10 years and then
5:15
when she decided she was ready to write
5:17
it it took her about two years to write
5:19
and she was saying that she so
5:21
appreciated and learned a lot of
5:23
patience during that process and later
5:25
appreciated that she took the time that
5:26
that book needed and i was reading this
5:29
outside on my porch and i just started
5:32
sobbing and my husband was like what is
5:34
wrong with you why are you sobbing are
5:36
you okay
5:37
and it was just this deep
5:39
understanding that
5:41
you know what i truly long for in my
5:44
heart is the freedom to take two years
5:47
to write a book if that's what i feel
5:48
that it needs i'm not avoiding it i'm
5:51
not you know in some kind of crisis it's
5:53
just that i'm an artist writing the
5:56
final book of a very long millions of
5:59
words series and i want it to be good
6:02
and sometimes that just takes a little
6:04
bit of time to come together it takes
6:06
marinating and thinking and excitement
6:08
and threads and decisions and you know
6:11
all of these things and
6:13
i was trying to pressure cook it in the
6:15
midst of all the stress that we had in
6:17
our lives in the midst of all the travel
6:19
and the packing and the money and
6:21
everything else that we were doing and
6:23
going through it was
6:25
really hard and even now that i
6:29
and then when i we finally got settled
6:30
and i have this beautiful wall in this
6:32
house and all my things again i thought
6:34
okay now it'll be easy and in the month
6:36
of july i did camp nanowrimo and i
6:39
actually wrote about 30 000 words of
6:41
this book but
6:43
i don't really like
6:45
a lot of the words that i wrote and i
6:47
don't really feel like i was
6:50
giving myself the time that i needed to
6:52
figure out what happened on the page i
6:53
was just doing the nanowrimo thing which
6:56
is trying to get the words down and i
6:58
could edit them later right and i think
7:00
that
7:01
that is one of the downsides to nano
7:03
sometimes is that sometimes we're
7:05
working on a book that needs
7:07
more space and sometimes it can be super
7:10
super helpful to have that deadline and
7:12
that motivation and just sit down and
7:14
get those words on the page and then you
7:16
begin to discover the story but this
7:18
particular book is just not coming out
7:20
that way and i realized when i was
7:22
writing for nano that i
7:24
want to be able to write words that i
7:27
love i'm excited to write again i'm
7:29
feeling creative and i'm ready to write
7:33
again but that story is just not ready
7:37
and so i am not pushing it to the side
7:39
i'm not setting it apart you know or not
7:42
gonna work on it at all but i am going
7:44
to dedicate certain parts of my week to
7:49
really allowing myself to just without
7:51
pressure think and daydream about that
7:54
particular story with no pressure to
7:56
write words and get them down on the
7:57
page
7:58
but i'm also on the other side of it
8:00
wanting to write and excited to write
8:02
and so i went away for the weekend to a
8:06
hotel and just did a deep dive into my
8:08
mental health my path to joy what's
8:11
going on in my life and i started to
8:13
realize you know that one of the reasons
8:16
that i became an indie author was
8:18
because i wanted the freedom to work on
8:21
what i wanted to the freedom to write
8:23
the way i wanted to and to market the
8:24
way i wanted to and over time as i've
8:28
become more and more successful as an
8:30
indie and then seeing some of those
8:32
sales drop off when i slowed down the
8:35
pressure has mounted to where i no
8:36
longer feel like i have the freedom to
8:39
choose and instead it feels like i'm
8:41
trying to please everyone else and as
8:44
someone who grew up in a household where
8:46
i was trained to believe that my
8:48
happiness was an afterthought that i was
8:50
there to make sure that someone else in
8:52
my household was happy all the time and
8:54
their happiness was more important than
8:56
my own i have grown up with some of
8:58
those same patterns being repeated in my
9:02
life where i sometimes sacrifice my own
9:04
joy for the responsibility and the
9:07
things that have to get done and i know
9:09
this is complex because there are times
9:11
when we need to just say this is what
9:13
i'm doing this is what's expected of me
9:15
and i need to turn it in and i need to
9:16
get it done but i think that
9:19
i
9:20
am also telling stories and lies in my
9:23
head that if i don't write this exact
9:26
story out on the timeline that my fans
9:28
want it to happen that i am not a good
9:30
person anymore or i am a failure or i'm
9:34
letting everybody down and that is a
9:36
weight that
9:38
hangs on my shoulders like a gravity
9:40
blanket and i cannot carry that weight
9:44
anymore and it may be true there are
9:46
definitely fans who get upset when you
9:48
take more than a couple of months
9:49
sometimes to write books but art doesn't
9:52
always work like that for all of us and
9:54
i
9:55
want to be able to write because i love
9:57
it not because i'm trying to write to
9:59
someone else's deadline or because i
10:01
want to make sure i don't disappoint
10:02
people or to make sure i sell a certain
10:04
number of books this is my soul and i
10:07
want the freedom
10:09
to write the way that i want to write
10:11
and to take the time that i feel a story
10:13
needs to blossom inside me so what i
10:16
realized this weekend as i was taking
10:18
time away and really journaling is that
10:20
i actually have that freedom i am very
10:22
lucky that i have that freedom
10:24
but i am the one putting those
10:26
expectations on myself and i'm the one
10:28
saying your happiness is more important
10:30
than mine what you want is more
10:32
important than what i want or what
10:34
brings me joy so
10:35
i'm kind of done with that for a little
10:37
bit
10:38
and now that i'm gaining perspective
10:41
over what the last basically year and a
10:43
half of my life has really meant in
10:45
terms of stress and finding myself and
10:48
getting grounded and finding this
10:49
beautiful house is
10:51
i'm starting to see
10:53
that
10:55
i have an amazing opportunity for my
10:58
dream life right now and the only thing
11:00
holding me back is my own
11:03
mental limitations and my own stories
11:06
and patterns that i keep replaying in my
11:08
head and i'm trying to heal from that
11:11
and trying to get over it and so one
11:14
step on that journey is that i have
11:16
decided i'm going to make some changes
11:18
both on heart breathings and in my
11:20
writing and i'll talk more about some of
11:22
the heart breathing changes like for
11:24
example maybe i'm only going to run
11:25
publish and thrive one time next year
11:27
instead of twice
11:29
maybe i'll do slightly less videos here
11:31
i'm not exactly sure what it's going to
11:33
look like in terms of what you guys will
11:35
see but i'm also going to try to batch
11:37
videos i've tried this some in the past
11:39
but i'm going to try that i'm going to
11:40
see if i can find a video editor so that
11:42
i'm not doing everything myself i have
11:45
an amazing operations manager renee but
11:47
maybe i want to hire a second person so
11:50
i'm thinking through some of these
11:51
things for how can i create space to
11:53
actually love my writing again and not
11:56
feel like i have to perform for someone
11:58
else that i just pour the
12:01
writing you know i have an entire quote
12:03
on my arm that says fill the paper your
12:05
paper with the breathings of your heart
12:07
today i've been trying to fill my paper
12:08
with what other people expect of me and
12:10
that is just not a great recipe for
12:14
creative joy and right now that's not
12:17
where i am in the disciplined do it to a
12:20
schedule kind of place so
12:22
i have kept my shadow demon's book 12
12:25
notes in my plotting notebook but i have
12:27
also just set it up for the
12:30
disappearance of vanessa shaw and
12:32
originally when i worked on this book it
12:34
was just vanessa's point of view in the
12:35
past and lorelei's point of view in the
12:38
present but that isn't totally working
12:41
and it has taken me a couple of years of
12:43
break on this to understand why and then
12:45
all of a sudden when i decided to work
12:47
on this not only did we start to get
12:49
rain after a drought which i felt like
12:52
was a sign of yes the ideas are about to
12:56
flow you've been in a drought of writing
12:57
and creativity and it's all about to
13:00
just come pouring through you and i'm
13:02
excited for that but also the second i
13:04
decided that i was going to work on this
13:06
the ideas of how to fix the story that i
13:08
originally started all came to me so
13:10
there's going to be seven different
13:12
points of view told some in the past
13:14
some in the present
13:15
and i'm so stoked about it i'm so
13:18
excited i'm so ready to work on this
13:20
some of my content here on heart
13:21
breathings is going to be around the
13:23
writing of this book so that i can make
13:25
sure that i'm staying focused on the
13:26
writing so if you enjoy writing vlogs
13:28
let me know if you'd rather see plotting
13:30
setups or what what aspect of me working
13:33
on this book while also working on book
13:35
12 would you like to see that i can
13:37
include here
13:38
because that'll just make everything
13:40
synergistic and flow together but let me
13:43
show you what i have set up for this and
13:46
yeah a few changes but if you have also
13:50
been feeling the need to take a step
13:52
back and gain perspective then i highly
13:54
encourage you if you can get to a coffee
13:56
shop get away for a hotel night if you
13:59
have the means to do so take a little
14:01
space for yourself lock yourself away in
14:03
your bedroom with a sign that says do
14:04
not disturb and really think about where
14:07
you are because money is great success
14:09
is great and sometimes we're in hustle
14:11
mentality and there are just stages in
14:12
our life where we need to go go and push
14:15
and then there are other times where we
14:17
need to feed our souls and to allow
14:20
ourselves to just do the creative thing
14:23
that our
14:24
joy is asking from us and right now i'm
14:27
focusing on that joy so if you're a fan
14:29
of the demon series maybe a little bit
14:31
of a longer wait but truthfully i don't
14:32
think it's going to push the book back i
14:35
think this is actually going to make the
14:36
book come faster and i'm pretty excited
14:38
for it so
14:40
that's kind of my story and my change
14:42
let's go set up all of these plotting
14:44
notes
My Plotting Setup
14:47
[Music]
18:13
[Music]
19:17
so
19:20
[Music]
Plotting Wall
20:28
okay so it's super rainy and dark here
20:30
so i do have a lot of lights on but i
20:32
have cleared my board and i
20:36
still have kept the post-it notes in my
20:38
plotting planner for the shadow demons
20:41
book but i'm excited to actually fill
20:43
this up so where i'm going to start with
20:45
the disappearance of vanessa shaw is
20:46
taking the 20 000 words i have so far
20:49
putting those scenes into my scene cards
20:51
like i explained in my previous video
20:53
series on scenes and i'm going to put
20:56
just some basics of those scenes up on
20:59
this wall in post-it notes and kind of
21:01
see where i stand in the story so far
21:03
here next to the wall i also have
21:07
so many shadows i also have this little
21:10
basket here and this has those tombos
21:13
which i'll mostly use for like headers
21:15
and also over here on the board itself i
21:18
have these emmet markers which are just
21:20
kind of like fine line felt tip type
21:22
markers i don't know if they have a felt
21:24
lip tip but they're like fine line 0.4
21:27
markers and i've got those in the same
21:29
color that i might also use on this
21:31
board i have post-it notes in all of the
21:34
colors that i need
21:36
and then i just have that washi tape
21:37
that i decided to use in case i want to
21:39
use it over here as well then on my desk
21:42
as i'm writing i'll have these ink joys
21:45
so that i can continue to keep notes on
21:48
in my plant plotting planner here and
21:51
then i also have these little dot
21:53
markers now i haven't actually tried
21:54
these yet these are not the zig clean
21:56
color dot markers these are just like
21:58
kind of like an amazon dupe from shuttle
22:00
art so i will let you know if these turn
22:03
out to be any good but they did have all
22:05
the colors that i needed and so i'm
22:08
going to have those in here then in my
22:10
plotting planner i have the smaller
22:12
post-its the page flags and i also have
22:15
the sharpies so that i can write on
22:17
those page flags then over here i have
22:20
those
22:21
note cards i always start with about 40
22:24
to 50 note cards but it could end up
22:26
being more or less and i'll just go
22:28
through them one at a time and i have
22:30
them all on this little book ring clip
22:33
to make sure that i don't lose them and
22:35
that's kind of my setup and i'm very
22:38
excited also to fill out this board but
22:42
also this other one here that says
22:44
characters because i was going to use
22:46
this for my shadow demon saga but i know
22:49
those characters so well i ended up not
22:51
writing anything here and only writing
22:53
in my plotting planner so this one
22:54
hasn't even really been used yet so i'm
22:56
gonna put all those seven points of view
22:58
on here and i'm about to hopefully light
23:01
this puppy up i'm hoping it's gonna be
23:03
really cool i hope you're excited to see
23:06
this novel come together um i know that
23:09
it can be tough sometimes for me to be
23:12
vulnerable and honest about this kind of
23:14
stuff because i know there's going to be
23:15
people out there or i always fear that
23:17
there will be people out there thinking
23:19
you never finish what you said you're
23:21
gonna do you never follow through with
23:23
stuff and i get those kind of comments
23:24
and they are hurtful because i always
23:27
feel like they're true like i'm
23:28
disappointing people and i just feel
23:30
like i'm at a point where i'm so over it
23:33
like i am allowed to be joyful i am
23:35
allowed to switch stories for no reason
23:37
at all other than the fact that i wanted
23:39
to and yes sometimes like if you're in
23:41
my publish and thrive class you know it
23:43
may not be the smart smartest marketing
23:46
move to switch stories or to not write
23:48
the next book in your series if you can
23:50
avoid switching you should but sometimes
23:52
you just need it and sometimes you just
23:55
have to listen to your heart and what
23:56
everyone else thinks of you you just
23:58
have to let it go and i even at my age
24:01
in my mid 40s have not really been able
24:03
to successfully let some of those things
24:05
go in the past and i feel like
24:08
i'm leveling up baby i am seeing some
24:10
changes i am ready to
24:12
let go and not worry about the people
24:14
that are disappointed or think that i'm
24:16
making a mistake and instead truly trust
24:18
my heart and my intuition and it's
24:20
telling me to work on this book it's so
24:22
funny because my husband george and i
24:25
every time i'm ready to write a book
24:27
like it starts to be
24:30
where the ideas are flowing and the
24:31
energy is coming through me he starts to
24:34
get
24:35
dreams like non-stop dreams throughout
24:37
the night and he's convinced that this
24:39
is a result of my brain working my
24:42
subconscious working through the night
24:44
that somehow energetically affects him
24:46
which i know some people would be like
24:48
well that's stupid but it we've seen it
24:50
happen it happens every time and i have
24:52
to tell you for the last like year of
24:54
our lives neither one of us have really
24:56
been dreaming and i think it goes to
24:58
other than a few nightmares here and
25:00
there neither one of us have been
25:01
dreaming like creative exciting or fun
25:04
or funny dreams we've just been
25:07
stressed
25:08
and so for the past couple of days
25:10
probably for about the past week since
25:12
we've been talking about the possibility
25:13
of me switching to the story it's been
25:15
nothing but dreams and yesterday when i
25:18
finally started writing out the ideas on
25:20
some post-its and printing out the old
25:22
version and stuff last night both of us
25:25
dreamed totally non-stop even while
25:28
there was storms going on and everything
25:29
else we both were dreaming and first
25:31
thing he said when he woke up was it is
25:33
so time for you to be writing because i
25:36
did not stop dreaming all night and
25:38
that's always a sign it's time and so i
25:40
feel like this is the right thing to
25:42
work on because at least i can get my
25:44
flow and my creative energy back and
25:46
then we'll see what happens with book 12
25:48
in the meantime so i'm going to be kind
25:50
of working on two books at the same time
25:52
and i'm so ready for it if you're
25:54
excited for it too definitely pop a like
25:56
on this video and a comment down below
25:59
i'm probably going to be making some
26:00
other changes like maybe less videos
26:03
here on heart breathings that aren't
26:05
vlogs or writing related content and
26:07
there are some other changes that i
26:08
might be making to make more room in my
26:11
schedule just for that creative
26:12
daydreaming and that flow and to be
26:14
working on two stories at once so i will
26:16
keep you updated with those changes but
26:18
i'm pretty excited and i hope you are
26:20
too i hope you're doing well and i hope
26:21
you if you are in a place where you feel
26:24
like gosh i'm always disappointing
26:26
people or i always tell people this is
26:27
what i'm writing and then when they ask
26:28
me i don't have any progress like just
26:31
know that it really doesn't matter what
26:33
anyone else thinks of your creative
26:34
process it's just a matter of how do you
26:37
feel about it and i
26:39
hope that this gives you a little bit of
26:41
encouragement and freedom to work on the
26:43
thing that your heart is really telling
26:44
you to work on all right you guys i will
26:47
see you in my next video and i'm sending
26:50
you all my love bye for now
26:53
[Music]
27:12
you
hi everyone and welcome back to heart breathings this is a bonus video for you today where i'm gonna be
0:06
giving you a lot of my own experience in terms of writing a series so this will be video number six in our
0:13
how to write and plan a series series and i'm going to be spilling all
0:18
the tea in terms of what are my biggest mistakes that i have made over the last decade in terms of writing
0:25
a series so if you want to hear all the ways i've messed up embarrassed myself made bad choices
0:32
so that hopefully you can avoid making these choices for yourself then definitely keep watching
0:39
[Music] so in all honesty i kind of hate to use
0:45
the word mistakes because i'm really proud of where i am right now in my career
0:51
i may not have always made the most directly beneficial to my career decisions but at
0:57
the same time every single choice that i've made every twist and turn of this career so far
1:03
has really led me to where i am right now and it's also taught me so much along the way so i
1:09
hate to think of it as like oh man i have this big regret or i made these huge mistakes and i'm
1:14
really disappointed in myself because that is not how i feel at all every single
1:19
wrong choice i have made has led me to understand the industry better to see where i can
1:26
improve and how i can make better decisions in the future now as you navigate this career for yourself
1:33
as an indie published author you don't have a big marketing team or a publisher or an
1:39
editor at a big house that is telling you this is where you should go this is how we're going to take your series because
1:46
you are the author but you are also the publisher so you get to decide what direction your
1:51
series goes in so if you're traditionally published you will get a little bit more guidance potentially
1:56
so much guidance that they take control of your series but when you're indie publishing like i am you get
2:03
all the decisions and there are a lot of benefits to this but there are also a lot of pressures
2:09
that come along with it so today i'm going to list my top five like worst mistakes that i've made
2:17
oh my gosh you guys the baby is asleep for a nap and my husband was just outside the like
2:22
glass window doors making faces and stuff at me and oh my gosh i really do love this life so
2:30
even despite the mistakes that i've made i have really been able to build a life that i truly love
2:36
so that just kind of uh illustrates the point that i was just about to make which is that as you make these choices
2:44
you are going to be in the moment feeling like oh my gosh i could go this way this way or
2:50
this way and unless you have some kind of crystal ball or some other type of divination or
2:56
future prediction you won't know exactly what the perfect decision
3:01
is you will have advice from potentially more people than you should be listening to
3:07
there will be people out there that will say this is the only way to do it the only people who are successful are
3:12
the ones who do it this way and if you don't do it this way you're never going to succeed or you're going to have friends that
3:18
will say oh i think that's a really bad choice for you but in the end the only thing that you
3:24
can do when you're navigating your career and you're making all these really difficult choices for yourself
3:29
is number one learn the business so gather information listen to what
3:36
other people are doing but actually watch what's happening with your audience your books what really makes them sell better what do
3:43
your reviews and your fans come back and say they love most about your work and really get to know the industry just like soak in it like you
3:49
would a hot tub and get it into your pores and your veins and like start to understand
3:55
how this business works and the only way you can do that is by getting into it and learning it as you
4:01
go and that's totally fine you're not going to have all the answers number two besides knowing the industry
4:07
i truly and firmly believe that instead of always listening to everybody else
4:12
especially people who tell you this is the only way forward because those people are wrong there is no only way in indie
4:19
publishing there's not even always a best way there's just the way that you choose and there's a
4:26
way that works for some people that won't work for others there is no one-size-fits-all path there is no trick
4:32
to it it's just following your heart and so one of my biggest advice pieces to you
4:38
which we'll talk about more next week in the next video about best practices is you have to listen
4:45
and learn to trust that little inner whisper of a voice inside of you that says
4:50
this may not be what everybody else is doing but this is what you should do because if i had to say the best thing
4:57
i've ever done for my career it's listen to that internal voice listen to that intuition
5:02
that intuition is influenced and educated by my experience of course
5:08
but it's also just something that is like my core values what i know i need to do
5:14
that's best for me as an individual and there may be other people that look at what i've done or the choices i've
5:19
made that are like well she's doing it wrong and that's totally fine because they don't have to live my life
5:24
you are the only one who has to live your life and live this career which is why it's so important to think about
5:29
what you personally want and to really listen to that internal voice inside you that says this is the path
5:36
for you now that being said i am going to go over five mistakes that i have made for lack
5:43
of a better word but as i talk through them i want you to also know that even though i have taken these
5:50
paths or made these choices that might not have worked out the best for me or maybe even hurt me in the long run i
5:57
truly believe that this was just part of my path it was part of the learning process for me it was part of what made
6:03
my career what it is and part of what made me who i am and all of these kind of have
6:08
two parts to the coin in some ways they hurt my career and in some ways they didn't and there's always going to be moments
6:14
when i can look back and say man if i hadn't done it that way maybe xyz would have happened if i
6:21
hadn't made this choice or this mistake maybe i would be a millionaire right now
6:26
and you could do that with your whole life so before we got too far into it i just wanted to make that statement that
6:32
really it's not about one path fits all or there's a right way to do things there's
6:38
really just follow your heart make the best choice you can with the knowledge and skill that you have right now
6:44
listen to people that you respect and just drown out everybody that says you have to do it this way when you feel
6:50
deep down that is not the path for you because you will hear a lot of people saying right now you have to be all in
6:56
ku you have to take out ten thousand dollars a month on advertising you have to do you know
7:01
whatever you have to write to trends you have to hire ghostwriters you will hear people say that and
7:08
then you will see someone like me sitting here and i do none of those things and i still make six figures a year so
7:14
you can't listen to the people who say there's only one way instead listen to your heart gather the
7:20
knowledge that you can and then just make the best decision make the next best decision for yourself and that's the
7:27
best we can do so with that being said let's get into some of the worst mistakes or worse decisions that i
7:34
feel i made in my own career in hopes that you can avoid these for yourself
7:40
so we're just going to start off with a bang because this is by far one of the worst decisions
7:46
that i have made for my career and for some reason i just keep continuing to make this mistake
7:53
and i feel like i have a hard time getting myself out from under this mistake and that is writing
7:59
too many series at once if you can write really really fast
8:04
then maybe you could handle writing three or four series and juggling that at once like it's not impossible to juggle
8:11
different povs or different story worlds or anything like that you can do it and if you write super fast you
8:18
could write one book in each series every quarter if you wanted to if you could write four books in three months which
8:24
some people do but for the majority of us we can only write a handful of books a year
8:30
i would say for most people even three books a year is a lot of books with every series that you start
8:37
before you finished the previous series or the series you were currently working on you divide your time in half so let's
8:44
say for example you can write on average two books a year well one of the fundamental truths and i've
8:50
talked about this many times on my channel of indie publishing and really any publishing but it's especially true for
8:56
indie publishing is that the faster you can put books out or the less time there is in between
9:02
books in a series releasing the better off you will be now sometimes i think you can go a little bit too fast
9:09
but that's a topic for another time but if you take six months to a year between books
9:16
in a series you will lose readers absolutely it's even getting with
9:21
so many people writing you know 14 15 books a year i would say some readers are getting to expect that you're gonna
9:26
have a new release every couple of months which is impossible for most of us but it is
9:32
just a part of the demand of our current culture of book readers especially if you're in ku if you can
9:38
write two books a year at best you're looking at six months apart between series book releases so if you
9:46
start a brand new series now you're taking that six months between releases and you're making it
9:52
a year between releases because now you have to write one book in this series and one book in this series so now each
9:58
series is only gonna have one book released every single year so what happens when
10:03
you start writing multiple series at once as you start dividing your time by the number of series you're writing
10:10
and what can happen which is what has happened with me several times is you convince yourself
10:16
that you'll just write faster okay well now instead of two books i can write three books or i'll write four books
10:22
this year i know i can do it and then you start a new series and now you need to be writing six books a year and six books a year is still only going
10:29
to get you just one book release in each series every six months so you begin to burn out you begin to
10:37
get more stressed the fans begin to wonder why are you writing all these other things when i wanted you to be writing this series
10:43
and it just adds a tremendous amount of stress well me as a writer who has on average
10:50
written two to three books a year i was writing five series at once and
10:56
this is hands down the biggest mistake i ever made in my career
11:01
and part of why i made this mistake is that sometimes if i get stuck
11:08
or emotionally drained on a series which we kind of talked about a little bit in my last video on the emotional toll of a
11:14
series so if you haven't checked that out i will link it for you down below i was getting burned out and i couldn't
11:20
get myself into a creative space where i was excited about that series so in order to spark something new that
11:26
shiny object syndrome i started writing something brand new and a couple of times it has happened to
11:33
me including just this february that i thought okay i'm just gonna write this one standalone book
11:38
and then i'll move on but this standalone or novella will get my spark going and then i can
11:44
move on back to my old series and what has happened like with the witch's key which i've got right back
11:49
here is as soon as i got halfway through that book i knew that i had started yet
11:54
another big series world because i just am a series writer it's who i am i need to embrace it and i
12:00
need to understand it so my decision to like spark creativity
12:05
by starting a new book has been great because i've ended up selling thousands more books because i
12:11
have these new series but it's been terrible because now we're looking at two years
12:16
since the last book in my most popular series has come out in october it will have been two years
12:22
since book 10 of my shadow demon saga and not only does that make me lose readers
12:28
but it kills the momentum of my series because people just kind of stop checking back in and they just are tired of waiting for
12:34
that cliffhanger to be over and to find out what happens next so it's not only just like losing the
12:40
actual readers but the readers you do have some of them start to lose their passion for the series or their momentum for the series
12:47
then you also have less people talking about your books because they're spread further and further apart
12:52
so it just doesn't have that like velocity that you would get if you were putting those books out
12:57
more closely together which you can't do unless you could write super super fast
13:03
this has been one of the biggest mistakes that i've ever made in my career and my hope to fix it is to finish all of
13:10
the books that i need to write to finish out those series i have five books before i can get back to the
13:16
witch's key and be focused on that 100 so
13:21
my real thought right now is i just have to get focused and write those books and then not start any new series in
13:29
between and this is really tough for me and i know it's tough for a lot of people because you have a lot of
13:34
ideas and that shiny new object syndrome just really pulls at you and so there is a lot of temptation to
13:41
start this series and this series in this series and in addition to it there is often a temptation to write
13:48
this other series in a totally new genre like right now i have this really cool like cozy mystery series idea
13:55
i also have a completed psychological thriller novel that i haven't edited yet but the
14:00
rough draft is completed and i have an idea for a fantasy series that i really want to write so it's like i want
14:08
to write all of those different things different genres different series and i could i absolutely could do it and be
14:14
happy doing it but i'm not going to make as much money and i'm not going to be able to support my family in the same way so there
14:20
are those whispers of your heart that you want to follow but you have to balance that if you want to make a living doing this
14:26
and you want to be a full-time writer you have to balance that with the marketing and reader expectations
14:31
and income projections and these are all very real things that you do have to balance and it's stuff i think about
14:38
and there is no doubt in my mind that writing so many series at once and splitting my time and attention between
14:43
them has hurt my career really more than anything else now with that being said i can't say
14:50
that i regret any of this because i have loved all of those books that i have written and
14:56
they needed to be written they needed to come out of me and i made the best decision that i could like the witch is
15:01
key i didn't mean to start a whole brand new series but i knew when the pandemic started that i wanted
15:06
to do something that would be fun for me but also be a community building thing for fans that were stuck at home alone and really
15:13
stressed out so this was like a community service and something that i wanted to do and was passionate about
15:19
it didn't make me tens of thousands of dollars but that's okay because sometimes we
15:25
make the choices that may not seem best from the outside or be best for our income or our fame level
15:31
but it's what feeds our soul so it's always a balance but i am not starting any new series until
15:39
all of these series are completed please hold me to that because it is really really tempting to start new series i will talk about this
15:46
some in my next video on best practices for marketing and selling a series but just know right now this was a big
15:53
mistake i made to split my time between series so the only reason i feel that it still worked out well for
16:00
me and my income continued to still be six figures and more is because i didn't start a new series
16:06
until i already had a best-selling series if i had only a couple of books in that first
16:12
demon series and it hadn't been selling that great and i started a new one and split my time before i really was
16:19
making a good living on that first series i wouldn't be here today so biggest advice for you is stick to
16:26
one series one genre one focus until you start making good money
16:32
then when the good money comes in and the fan base is starting to get solid and they love your writing then
16:37
you can branch out to something else but don't branch out to five or six something else
16:42
and don't jump to a lot of different genres if you want to make a living at this because it is going to make everything
16:49
harder biggest mistake number two plays right off the back of mistake number one
16:55
which is taking too much time between releases in a series now you could say oh i well i can write
17:01
three books a year okay but if those like when people say that you should rapid release or release
17:07
books quickly back to back they don't mean just any random books that you want to do there is a strategy to self-publishing
17:14
and to making money and marketing your books well and if you are putting out three books a year and they're all three
17:20
in different series or different genres you will most likely struggle and while i can tell you that there is
17:26
no one path to fame there are things that you can do that can really hurt you and things you can
17:32
do that can help you and as much as you may want to write all those different genres or all those different series i highly recommend
17:39
that you sit down and think realistically about how much you can write and stay sane and be taking care
17:46
of your mental health because that is a very important factor to this how much can you actually write
17:52
realistically in a year and if you can write say four books in a year then i would stick with one
17:58
maybe two different series but i would not go beyond that because then you're going to get into the problem that i
18:04
have had which is too much time between series so these two go hand in hand
18:09
too much time between books and a series is its own problem and its own mistake
18:14
within itself so it deserved its own bullet point here like i said my shadow demon saga this is
18:22
my best-selling series it has sold over half a million copies i am 10 books into the main series
18:28
then i also have a completed spin-off series i have a couple standalone like novella and a book involved in this world and
18:35
all told there are over 1 million words written in this world and i've been writing it for
18:40
one full decade as of this summer so oh my gosh coming up in october will
18:46
be one decade since i first published beautiful demons which is this book over here you can see the poster
18:53
um and yeah i have sold over half a million copies of that series which is awesome
18:58
but sometimes i do sit and think if i hadn't taken so long between book
19:04
releases in that series over the course of these 10 years maybe it would have been 2 million
19:10
copies sold or 3 million copies sold and part of the mental health aspect of this career is being able to look back
19:16
and say i can't regret it i did the best i could with what i had at the time and what i had sometimes was a baby
19:24
a pregnancy a miscarriage a move and other things so it's you can't look back on it and just say
19:30
oh i should have been writing faster this you know you're still a human being you're not a robot and so i try not to
19:36
focus on that mistake but what i did was when i first started publishing my shadow demon saga it was
19:42
called the peachful high demon series and i wrote and published the first six books in that series
19:48
within two years a little over two years so book one came out in october 2010
19:53
and book six which was the end of a character arc the end of a story arc like we've talked about in this series
20:00
it was the end of a series arc came out in december of 2012. book five came out in january of 2012 and book six
20:07
came out in december of that same year but that december release was by far
20:13
my biggest release of all time i almost launched into the amazon top 100 i sold
20:18
thousands of books in a day and it was extremely exciting but
20:24
i was a little bit burned out on that series i was excited to try something else i knew that that series would
20:29
continue that the story wasn't completely over but i was also really anxious to try some new things so
20:35
this is sort of where we get into number three because all of these play together but i decided to work on an old book
20:43
and publish something called death's awakening which was a zombie book still has witches in it but it was slightly different genre feel because it
20:50
was post-apocalyptic so not only did i move on to something else i moved on to something else that was slightly
20:56
different then i also moved on to something else that year that was very different which is my fair
21:03
hope series so it was a new adult contemporary romance and i had a story that i really wanted to tell
21:08
this is one of those things that was like the whispers of your heart and i had to listen to it so i had this book i really wanted to
21:14
tell and this became the trouble with goodbye which is not exactly autobiographical
21:19
but it is very similar to my own experience i wrote that book totally different genre completely
21:26
different pov tense everything was totally different so i went
21:32
off the momentum of this amazing series and all these major sales and i just was like let me totally
21:38
reinvent my whole career probably not the best decision
21:43
but we'll get to that mistake in a moment i did not publish another book in that
21:49
series until a standalone thing in 2013 and then finally a couple of years later i
21:55
released book seven in that series so two years between releases and then
22:00
again book eight took a long time book nine took a long time nine and ten both came out in 2018
22:06
however here we are and in october november of 2020 it will have been two years since
22:12
book 10. so all of those delays two years between books a year between books have hurt me
22:19
enormously i have lost thousands of readers along the way because they lost interest they didn't
22:26
stick around they got tired of waiting who knows what i have also picked up readers along the way but i really lost a lot of momentum
22:33
with so much time in between series books and it's not just that one series because like i mentioned in mistake
22:40
number one i had multiple series going so i'm currently working on book three of my
22:45
eternal sorrows series and it has been since 2016 that the last book came out
22:51
so we're looking at four years since the previous release as an indie author this is just a huge no-no
22:58
fans will wait because they love you but a lot of fans will just get it angry and leave
23:03
so if you can try to avoid putting years between releases sometimes
23:09
it's just unavoidable i had a miscarriage i had a pregnancy we moved it was just really difficult to get
23:16
those next books out and i couldn't force myself to do it but i will say this if i hadn't split my time between so
23:22
many different series it wouldn't have been this difficult when i ran into some hard times so just some lessons learned there too
23:29
many series all at once that were splitting my time and number two that led to too much time
23:35
between releases in the same series so that also plays into number three which is inconsistent
23:42
choices so a few little stories here because i have made a lot of inconsistent choices
23:48
so one of them being genre i started out young adult witchy books and then when i finished that series arc
23:56
with book six i went on to publish a contemporary romance with an older heroine so heroin in her
24:02
twenties i hate to call it a mistake because i really poured my heart into those
24:07
bear hope books particularly the first book but in terms of the recommendation
24:13
engine and things like that at amazon and the marketing of the books it is generally considered a mistake to
24:19
switch genres so drastically and use the same pen name and use the you know be marketing it to
24:24
the same readers so we'll talk about that in my publish and thrive course if you want to come join us you can also check out
24:30
david gogren's work i'll link a blog post he has below about the recommendation engines and why you
24:36
shouldn't be publishing in multiple genres if you're interested in reading them however this series also was a big
24:43
success i have sold over and fifty thousand copies of my fair hope series too so even though it was a
24:48
different genre it still worked for me but some of the inconsistencies there
24:54
are the fact that the first three books are all female point of view when i got to book
24:59
four i realized i wanted to tell the male point of view in this romance as well
25:05
because the hero in that story in book four it's called the fear of letting go
25:10
his name is preston wright and he's the twin brother of the heroine in book two penny and he had appeared throughout the
25:16
story right from book one and i knew people really loved him as a character and they wanted to get to know him better so i was like
25:23
this story has to be told from both points of view so that's an inconsistency fair hope series has six books in it the
25:30
first three are the heroines pov only the next three are hero and heroine and they're more
25:36
more they feel more like romances than like women's fiction so an inconsistency that i believe hurt
25:43
me in terms of my sales and the read through from my readers
25:49
so that's a pov inconsistency i also have a pov inconsistency in my shadow
25:54
demon saga that i've got over here so that first six book character arc i was talking about that finished in 2012
26:01
all six of those books are told exclusively from my main heroines point of view harper but
26:08
when i came back to the story two years later and i wanted to continue writing it i
26:13
realized that the story had gotten bigger than just this one person and so i made the choice or the decision
26:20
to split it into four points of view so now you have two male points of view an extra female point of view and you
26:26
still have harper so it's harper and three other people and the story needed it i don't regret
26:32
that or necessarily consider it a mistake but that inconsistency did throw some
26:38
people off and i have had some comments from readers in the past that were like oh my gosh book seven with these four points of
26:44
view made it much harder for me to follow the story or i didn't like it as much the majority of my readers love it and
26:51
they feel like it made the story so much richer but i do have some people that fell off because they didn't love it
26:56
so inconsistency one of the biggest inconsistencies that i feel hurt me so
27:02
this is just from my own personal choice is a releasing strategy inconsistency so my book
27:08
sacrificed me i told as a serial and i am going to do by popular request
27:14
a full video on the difference between a series and a serial because i do have
27:19
experience with both so stay tuned for that in a couple of weeks but my book sacrificed me was told as a
27:25
serial so it has six episodes in it and each episode is between say 17
27:30
000 and maybe 25 000 words and it each one is a piece of the story so
27:35
this was one of those books that i was burned out on my other series and was looking for something to write that
27:42
would spark some imagination and i had this idea and i had this vision of this moment
27:48
in an alleyway and i was like oh my gosh i want to write this story so i sat down i actually went to a hotel
27:54
and i wrote the first episode all 17 000 words in a day in a single night it was inspired i loved it i was having the
28:00
time of my life so what i decided to do was write this as a serial where each part would come out
28:06
two weeks apart from the previous so what i did was i released episodes one and two on
28:12
the same day and made episode one free right from the start so this was my like publishing strategy
28:18
to not only breathe new life and momentum into my career that had kind of been
28:24
you know after delay after delay kind of stagnant for a while so i was
28:29
going to build momentum introduce readers back into the shadow world but with new characters because
28:34
it's a spin-off right so i released episodes one and two on the same day episode one was free episode two was 99
28:42
cents so i released those and then at the same time i had episode three up for pre-order two weeks out so
28:51
i had two weeks to market that then episode three came out and episode four
28:56
was on pre-order and i kept it going that way until we got to episode six and season
29:02
one of sacrifice me was completed at that point i boxed up
29:07
all six episodes and put them into a complete season one box set of sacrifice me
29:12
i cannot remember if i put the box set up for pre-order ahead of time or if i just released it
29:18
a couple weeks after the end but it doesn't really matter the thing that's important about this is that that release strategy did
29:24
everything i hoped it would do it gave me new momentum it brought old readers back to my books it got people
29:30
excited it got people talking about me but because of the 99 releases
29:37
i wasn't making very much money in indie publishing you make on average about 35 cents per
29:43
99 sale it's a 35 royalty at most places or around there so even if you sell a thousand books
29:50
you're only making 350 and there's nothing wrong with 350 i know that's still a lot of money but in
29:56
terms of sales that wasn't a lot of money per book sold so that means that while those books
30:02
were coming out i sold about 10 10 000 copies of the episodes
30:07
at 99 cents each so i made about 3 500 which was great but when the box set
30:13
came out over the course of the next six months i sold about 16 000 copies of the
30:18
box set and the box set was 399 which means at that rate you make about a 70 royalty or about
30:26
2.75 so if you do the math there i sold the individual episodes
30:32
and made about 3 500 i sold the box set of all the episodes together
30:38
and i made about 45 000 so which one would you think was more
30:44
successful it seems like obviously the box set was what readers wanted most
30:50
so years later when it came time to write season two because of course
30:55
time between which is another mistake i've made and i was going to release season two
31:01
i was trying to decide did i want to follow that same release strategy of 99
31:06
books every two weeks to build momentum but not make much money or did i want to release them and
31:14
all as a box that all in one and there were pros and cons to both ideas i wanted to make as much
31:20
money as i could plus it was very stressful releasing a new book every two weeks so i wanted to
31:26
reduce the amount of stress but i also wanted to keep up the excitement of like multiple releases
31:31
so what i decided to do was release season two in two parts of three
31:37
episodes each so season two part one has episodes one through three season two part two has episodes four through
31:43
six and i released them each at 2 or 3.99 a piece and what i was hoping is that i would
31:49
get the best of both worlds so i would have two basically two box sets at the 70
31:54
royalty rate which would max maximize my income for the amount of time i spent on those
32:00
books which was considerable but i would also have the momentum of having two releases kind of back to back
32:06
well i made the wrong choice because looking back in hindsight part of the
32:12
beauty of that sacrifice me cereal and any cereal is the anticipation the cliffhanger
32:19
waiting for the next book the cliffhanger waiting for the next book people talking about it building up that buzz
32:24
so even though the money wasn't as good the marketing was great the excitement was great the fun that we
32:31
were having with readers was part of the magic of that season one release so when i did something inconsistently
32:37
different for the release of season two i kind of killed the momentum to be honest and i still have readers even
32:44
two years later saying are you gonna ever release a full box set of season two and it's like ah no because i released
32:51
season two and parts one and two and they're like ah but i just kind of want a full box out of all six and so i feel like that was a huge
32:58
mistake i know this is very story time sarah right now but hopefully you can see through that example
33:04
that i was trying to take what i had learned from the past and recreate something new experiment
33:11
with something new but i was trying to make as much money as possible and i wasn't thinking
33:17
about some of the other magic of releasing six books back to back every two weeks
33:23
i considered it but i was thinking that the money was more important in a way
33:28
and the truth is that i made a mistake i should have released the second season
33:35
exactly the same way i did the first season i should have done six episodes back to
33:40
back every two weeks and then put out a box set of the entire completed season two all at once at the end and i think i
33:47
would have made more money in the long run and i think i would have had a heck of a lot more momentum on my career when
33:53
i needed it most so that is definitely something i can look back on and be like okay next time when it comes to my
33:59
strategy i really need to stay consistent so inconsistencies
34:05
is number three and like i've talked about that means inconsistencies in genre in points of view choices in
34:13
the release strategies and things like that hindsight is 2020 as they say so i can't go back and change that but
34:19
that is definitely one of the big mistakes that i feel that i made along the way mistake number four is
34:26
kind of along that line of trying to maximize the income potential there's nothing wrong with trying to
34:31
make as much money as possible for the work that you put into it selling a book at 99 cents or giving it away for free can
34:39
sometimes feel like oh my god i put years of my life into it i cannot give it away for free
34:44
or i can't only charge 99 cents but sometimes you do need to look at the overall
34:50
benefits and not just the income also i feel like there is
34:55
always this little voice that corresponds with i mean you can call it alignment you can call it your intuition
35:02
whatever you want to call it i feel like if you get still and you really think what is it i feel is best
35:09
and you stop looking at everybody else's advice all the time you can usually come up with the answer
35:14
that is right for you i have gone against my own intuition only a couple of times one was that
35:21
sacrifice me situation that i just told you about it was something that i kind of thought i know i need to do it this way but i'm
35:28
afraid i'm not going to make as much money and i had several friends telling me go for the money go for the money it's a
35:34
cash grab go for the money and so i followed that advice and i wish i had not i wish i had listened to myself
35:39
the other big time i did this and i have talked about this a few times and this is truly one of the only regrets of my
35:45
entire career is when i was writing my fair hope series which is that new adult
35:50
contemporary romance series i was talking about book one the trouble with goodbye was
35:55
like a book of my heart it was almost like i said almost autobiographical it mirrors in some ways a lot of my own
36:03
experience in the small town i grew up in as well as some of my experiences with sexual assault
36:08
and i poured so much of my heart into that and it was a it was a very emotional book some people hated it
36:16
because it doesn't have necessarily like a happily ever after type resolution to it but a lot of people
36:22
loved it and when i say a lot of people i mean like tens of thousands of people loved that
36:27
book and bought it and enjoyed it but here's what happened
36:33
with that book so to fully understand what i did and why i did it you have to kind of go back to where
36:40
things were in 2012. at the end of 2012 colleen hoover kind of exploded a new genre along with
36:48
a few other authors called new adult fiction and this was not something that really had existed
36:53
before 2012. it was a niche genre that was mostly focused on romance or like what you
37:00
might call women's fiction with college-to-age characters facing things that like is coming of
37:05
age in college type things and colleen hoover's book hopeless hit i believe number one on amazon for
37:13
weeks and weeks it was a huge release and it sort of created a whole new genre and i loved
37:19
these books when i picked up this book as well as several others in this genre at the time i was like oh my
37:24
gosh these books are hauntingly beautiful they're so emotional and i have a story to tell about sexual
37:30
assault and i want to write this book and so i wrote this book the trouble with goodbye while this was happening
37:36
and i was working on that book i had several friends who also had been writing young adult
37:41
paranormal or young adult witchy type books who started writing new adult contemporary as well
37:47
and these people some of my friends were hitting the usa today bestseller list they were doing like
37:53
huge breakout success and so there was a part of me inside that was thinking okay i'm
37:59
writing a book in this genre too very trendy genre am i going to hit the
38:04
usa today bestseller list could this be my big breakout thing now i was coming off the success of the
38:10
sixth book in my series that i told you already was like the best release i'd ever had and now i'm
38:17
trying a new genre but i'm thinking this could be something that could be a breakout for me then i let a few people read it that i
38:24
had not used before like these were not normal beta readers for me these were just like other author
38:29
friends that i said will you read this and tell me if you think it's in line with this genre and if it's good enough you know
38:35
give me some feedback and everybody who read it before release came back and said this book had me in
38:42
tears i loved it you're gonna hit the list with this this is going to be your breakout book
38:47
and i let all of that put a lot of pressure but also a lot of hope that this would be something that would be a
38:53
breakout book for me a huge success let's just say my ego got involved i wanted to hit a list i wanted to have
39:01
that fame i wanted to hit bigger but this crazy curious thing happened because i
39:08
while i was editing that book and it was going to come out in may of 2013 the new
39:14
adult genre kind of shifted very suddenly hm ward started coming out with sexier books some other people came
39:21
out with sexier books abby gleins and a few others and suddenly this angsty sort of emotional
39:27
coming of age genre sort of shifted into a much sexier genre my book the trouble
39:34
with goodbye did not have any sex it had a closed kind of like a closed door one
39:39
scene but it wasn't sexy it wasn't in that way it was much more of that like emotional kernel
39:45
and so suddenly it like shifted so quickly that by the time the book came out in
39:50
may it was almost like a totally different genre now my book still did extremely well it
39:56
did very well but it didn't hit the new york new york times it didn't hit some big list it
40:02
didn't get all this attention that i was hoping that it would get and i would have people coming to me and
40:07
saying i don't understand why your book isn't doing better but i could see the genre and see that it was going so much sexier so
40:14
here's where the mistake comes in because at this point i had decided as we talked about
40:19
that this needed to be a series that i really wanted to tell the story of all of leanne's friends and the town of
40:25
fairhope so i had already started working on book two of this series and i had a very gr you know small group
40:32
of trusted friends who were what very well meaning they knew i was very upset
40:38
about the book not doing as well as i had hoped and they said to me you've got to write
40:43
book two sexier if you really want to hit the list and you want to get bigger with this you want to be a breakout then
40:49
he you have to write an alpha male and it's got to be a really really sexy book and so that's
40:55
what i tried to do i tried to make mason in book two you know a really like broken guy and
41:02
like an alpha male and i tried to make it a really angsty like sexy book and it starts out with a
41:08
sex scene and all of this stuff in the end that's just not what i write
41:14
so i couldn't pull it off the way some of these other amazing authors were so what happened to me at this point was
41:21
i i still in the end that book is still a sarah cannon book it is still very true to me it still
41:27
comes back to a very emotional core and it turns out that mason is not really the jerk you think he was
41:34
which is very true to me but i know from experience and from looking
41:40
back and talking to some fans that i had a large group of fans who loved book one
41:46
and the emotion that i brought to that book and when they picked up book two they wanted the same feeling they wanted
41:52
the same type of story and instead what they got was like a drunk girl on a party boat
41:59
having sex with a guy in a room downstairs and it just wasn't what they expected
42:05
from me and this is not a dig on anyone who writes romance or sexier books because that is
42:11
great it's just that that was not true to me i was not being true to my true core values as a writer or to my
42:19
style or to what i'm best at and i think that the numbers speak for
42:25
themselves i sold 36 000 copies of book two in that series in the first year that it was out
42:31
which means that so many people loved book one that 36 000 of them went on to buy book two book three in
42:38
the series though people were so disappointed with book two and the way i chose to write that
42:43
book that i only sold 12 000 copies of book three now i know that 12 000 copies is still
42:49
something to be proud of but if you think about it that means i had 24 000 or more people who were so
42:55
disappointed and didn't like that book that they abandoned the series and didn't continue to read
43:00
and that is truly one of the only regrets that i have of my entire career
43:06
i didn't want to go and write something super sexy with a hero that was very alpha male i didn't want to write a bully kind of
43:12
guy who was mean to her that was not like the kind of stuff i like to read and not the kind of stuff
43:18
that i like to write but i listened to everybody else and i was listening to the spear inside of me
43:23
that said you're never going to be successful unless you go sexier and if you write sexier you'll be more successful
43:29
and so even though i didn't want to i tried to do it and that is truly one of the only and
43:34
main regrets of my entire series was chasing the trend instead of following
43:40
my own heart and who knows what might have happened to my fair hope series if i had written that book the way i truly
43:47
wanted to and there have been times i've talked about this before that i've considered going back to rewrite that book
43:53
in the end i did stay true to myself but the opening of that book is not really the way i would have
43:59
wanted to write it if i had been in my right mind and really following my own instincts
44:05
so again please do not take this as any kind of dig on people who write sexy
44:10
romance because i know millions of people love it and it is very popular it's just not what i was put on this
44:17
earth to write and i shouldn't have tried it because it's just not my thing and i compromised myself and the series
44:25
trying to chase and follow that trend and it is the only time in my life i will ever do it
44:30
and the reason i don't go back and change that book is because it will forever serve as a reminder to me
44:36
of what not to do and i still think that's a good book i still have fans that love that book but i also know
44:42
that some of my intentions when i was writing that book were not true to myself and i will never forget that in the end
44:49
it's totally fine to chase trends to write to trends to write to the market
44:54
all of that stuff is great there's no judgment against that but you have to also i think make sure that whatever you're
45:01
writing aligns with who you truly are and what you really want to write because the people that
45:06
were writing it because they loved it they loved this sexy new adult romance they were great at it and they did it
45:12
well and they found their audience but me someone who didn't really feel like writing that didn't want to write
45:18
that i could never it's like an imposter trying to pretend i could write that
45:23
and that's why i wasn't successful writing it and i feel like in the end one of the best things you can do for
45:28
yourself is to write the books that you love to write the books that you
45:34
want to write and if you happen to see a trend that you love and you want to
45:40
write go follow that because the chances are you might be a huge success doing it but don't follow a trend that you don't
45:47
actually have an interest in or that you don't like just because you think it's going to make you a lot of money
45:52
because even if it does make you some money it's not going to fulfill you on a personal and spiritual level and it won't that
46:00
money doesn't last forever and the fame doesn't last forever and it's so much better to be true to yourself than to go running after trends
46:06
that you don't have any interested in so that's just my pure opinion and my own personal experience but i
46:13
would say that is one of my biggest mistakes and my worst regret so far in this career and finally
46:19
mistake number five is failing to capitalize on momentum when i have had it so this all plays in
46:27
with all the other four points that i've tried to make here for myself is when i saw that shadow demon saga and
46:35
i had that sixth book release and it was so successful really the smart thing would have been
46:41
to if i was burned out i should have written one book like maybe just a standalone book the trouble with goodbye
46:46
and not written that series and then gotten right back to the series that had momentum
46:51
or if i was burned out on that series i should have written another series similar to it like the witch's key is
46:58
very similar to my shadow demon saga so if i had come out with the witch's key right after book six of my shadow demon
47:05
saga i would have capitalized on the momentum of that best-selling series similarly
47:10
when sacrifice me came out and that was a big success in terms of that cereal and i was telling you i had all this
47:15
momentum the next thing i should have written was season two right away right then but instead i
47:23
fractured myself and i failed to capitalize on that momentum i have talked about this some in the
47:28
past and this is very personal stuff but part of the reason that i didn't
47:35
capitalize on the momentum that i had at the time was purely self-sabotage
47:40
because there was a piece of me deep down inside that truly believed that i was not
47:46
worthy of the level of success that i had reached if you've ever read the book the big leap by gay hendricks
47:52
this is what he's talking about in that book is that for most of us we have something
47:58
called an upper limit problem where it's like an upper limit of income or notoriety or happiness that
48:06
we feel like this is the absolute upper limit of what i deserve and in my fundamental self i am a flawed
48:12
person or i'm not good enough for this and so when we begin to approach that upper limit
48:18
we sabotage ourselves i have learned in the years since i sabotaged myself the worst in
48:25
about 2016 i have learned in the last few years that really it was a choice not to
48:31
capitalize on that momentum because i was scared i was approaching that upper limit and i had a
48:38
lot of mental things that i needed to work on i had a lot of spiritual and internal things that i needed to work on
48:44
for myself my own attitude and my own mindset this is why here on heart breathings and
48:50
in my courses i put so much emphasis on your mental health and really knowing what it is you want
48:57
as an individual because sometimes a lot for a lot of us you think i want this type of
49:05
life but the truth is even if you started to get close to that life you might throw it all away because
49:11
you're afraid because you feel deep down that you're not worthy of it that you feel like you're an imposter
49:17
and somebody is going to call you out and be like you really can't write what are you doing up there
49:22
on the bestseller list and i think this is something a lot of us authors face and so
49:27
that's my fifth biggest mistake that i made was failing to
49:32
capitalize on momentum when i had series that were doing extremely well and part of the self-sabotage is
49:40
starting too many series or hitting writer's block and not being able to complete the next book and
49:45
taking too much time or listening to my fear and say i'm going to write this book in a different way than i think i should
49:51
because i want to be more famous or i want to make more money so i think that all five of these things
49:57
all five of these mistakes play in together and i feel like i've been pretty vulnerable being super honest with you guys about
50:04
this so please be nice in the comments i never mean any of this stuff as criticism for someone else this is all
50:10
just purely criticism on myself but it's mostly just trying to share my journey with you so that you understand
50:17
a couple of different things number one that you're probably going to make mistakes of your own on this
50:22
journey of being an author you're going to make wrong choices you're going to hit your own upper limits you're going to sabotage
50:28
yourself you're going to hit writer's block all of these things are going to happen but number two that i want you to
50:34
understand is that i can still sit here even after all these mistakes that could have been career killers or could have been things
50:40
that i can look back on and really be angry with myself about that i can still sit here
50:46
and i can be proud of myself i'm still supporting my family with my income i'm still making my dreams come true
50:53
despite those mistakes and i'm still most importantly number three i'm still learning from those mistakes and trying
51:00
to be better if you come into this career and you expect yourself to make you put the pressure on yourself that i have to make
51:06
all the perfect choices that i have to do everything exactly like somebody told me i have to make all the right choices i
51:12
have to be the best possible writer and you expect perfection from yourself then you are going to
51:18
struggle with the emotional and mental side of this business you have to give yourself permission to
51:24
make mistakes to follow your heart to meet yourself where you are in the moment because hey sure it might
51:31
have been great if i had finished book six and taken that momentum and immediately written book seven but i was not
51:37
mentally in a place where i was ready to write book seven and so sure it might not have been the very best decision for my career but it
51:43
was the best decision for my mental health and for my emotion and for my family and sometimes those things are going to
51:49
take precedent so i hope that this video has helped you see
51:55
that there really is a lot that goes into strategy and mistakes and choices but like i said
52:00
short of having a crystal ball in your pocket you're not always going to know the exact right choice and it's okay
52:07
it's okay to make mistakes you can still sit here and say i still feel successful i
52:13
still am proud of what i have built even though i have made mistakes along the way
52:19
so don't get so stressed about what mistakes you might make that you fail to get in the game the
52:25
best thing that i did for myself is start publishing even when i wasn't perfect
52:31
and i continue to do this every single day that i continue to try i continue to keep working i continue to make choices
52:37
to the best of my ability even though i know i've made mistakes along the way i keep showing up
52:43
so instead of expecting perfection from yourself i hope that you'll move forward and say
52:49
it's okay if i make mistakes i'm going to make mistakes but i'm going to learn from them as i go
52:54
and i'm going to get better and better all right guys i hope this has been helpful for you i hope this whole series has been helpful for you
53:00

[Music] bye
55:50
[Music]
56:01
you

hey everybody today we are gonna talk
0:02
about something that I know a lot of you
0:03
struggle with which is whether or not
0:06
you should write in multiple genres
0:11
alright so this is something I have
0:14
struggled with because I am what people
0:16
call a multi passionate entrepreneur
0:18
I've struggled not only with what genre
0:20
to write but what business to run and
0:22
where to focus my time this is a huge
0:23
huge problem for me but here are some
0:26
things that I hope will resonate with
0:28
you and hope will help you build your
0:30
career a little bit faster so one thing
0:32
to think about in specifically talking
0:35
about whether or not you should write in
0:37
multiple genres is remember we talked
0:39
about in the very beginning and if you
0:41
if you didn't remember this I will link
0:43
it down below but I was telling you that
0:45
number one thing you have to decide when
0:47
you self-published when you really want
0:50
to make this your career is what do you
0:51
want what do you want out of your career
0:53
what are you trying to build if you
0:56
answered that and the answer was you
0:59
want to build a core fan base you want
1:01
to make a lot of money doing this you
1:02
want to build up that career really
1:04
quickly and you want to write what you
1:07
love if your answers were along those
1:09
lines then I'm telling you right now you
1:11
are going to be better off focusing in
1:14
on one single genre at least in the
1:16
beginning and I know there are a lot of
1:17
you that are gonna hear that and be like
1:20
knife to the heart because it is very
1:23
difficult when you are multi passionate
1:25
and you really love you know dystopian
1:28
at just as much as you love epic fantasy
1:30
it is very difficult to let go of one of
1:34
those or to choose between the two
1:36
because if you love them equally how do
1:39
you make that decision
1:40
well we'll cover how you make the
1:42
decision later and if you do want to
1:44
hear you know my advice on how to choose
1:46
which Donna if you're thinking about
1:47
multiple comment below and let me know
1:49
that that's something you're interested
1:50
in seeing but you know to focus this in
1:53
the reason that I say you should focus
1:56
on one genre at a time is well there are
2:00
multiple reasons but one of them is that
2:02
readers tend to read in a series they
2:05
tend to read you know they may there may
2:08
be lots of readers that read across
2:09
multiple genres but when it they're
2:11
looking for this one
2:13
usually the way you build that career is
2:15
you become known for one thing one
2:17
series one genre you pull in more
2:20
readers that way now there are always
2:22
going to be readers like I have readers
2:24
now I write multiple genres and I have
2:25
readers that have read everything and
2:27
they will continue hopefully to read
2:29
anything I put out but when I was
2:32
growing my career I started out with one
2:34
series in young adult which is demons
2:38
young adult small town and that's how my
2:41
readers knew me and that's how really
2:43
today the core of my fan base that's
2:45
what they want from me even though
2:46
they're willing to read other things but
2:49
if I had not started out with that one
2:51
great series right from the beginning
2:53
that was very focused I had relatively
2:56
fast releases I put out six book series
2:58
in a matter of two years if I hadn't
3:01
done that I think I really would have
3:03
missed out on building what I call an
3:06
anchor series now the next couple of
3:08
weeks I'm going to be talking almost
3:09
exclusively about how to build an anchor
3:12
series and what that is your focus
3:15
should be on growing your career which
3:17
means not only bringing in new readers
3:19
but also holding on to those readers
3:22
once you have them now imagine this
3:24
let's say you wrote this amazing young
3:26
adult dystopian novel and there's more
3:30
to come in the story and so many people
3:32
were so excited about it because you you
3:34
know you got some good advertising some
3:36
Facebook ads or you just got into a
3:38
Facebook group where people were talking
3:40
about it and they all started telling
3:41
their friends so everybody finds out
3:43
that you have this amazing young adult
3:44
dystopian novel well they finish that
3:47
book the first thing if readers really
3:49
love your work the first thing they do
3:50
is they go to see what else you have
3:52
is there another book in the series
3:54
that's going to be the number one thing
3:55
they ask well let's say they get to the
3:58
back your book and there's no link to
3:59
another dystopian young adult book
4:01
instead there's a link to an epic
4:04
fantasy a police procedural mystery and
4:07
a contemporary romance because that's
4:09
all you've written so far this year most
4:13
readers the majority of readers are
4:15
going to look at that list of all these
4:17
other genres where you only have one
4:19
book out in each and they're going to be
4:21
disappointed that you don't have more of
4:22
what they just read because they want
4:24
that
4:25
feeling recreated and they're most
4:28
likely going to go look for something
4:29
that was like what you just wrote rather
4:32
than pick up now your police procedural
4:35
now there are always exceptions to the
4:38
rule because they're always going to be
4:39
those readers they go well I don't care
4:41
I just loved everything about this book
4:43
so now I'm gonna go read her other thing
4:44
but when you're talking about
4:46
percentages
4:46
you know maybe 5% of readers are gonna
4:49
go pick up something in a different
4:50
genre whereas if you nail to that first
4:54
book something more like 90% or more
4:58
than that are gonna go and pick up the
4:59
second book in that series or if you had
5:01
another young adult dystopian I really
5:04
hope this makes sense to you and I hope
5:05
you really listen to me because this is
5:07
how you build your indie career when
5:11
readers get finished with that thing
5:13
they've just loved from you what they
5:15
want more than anything is that exact
5:17
same feeling that exact same experience
5:19
only better so if you have a great young
5:22
adult dystopian give them another great
5:24
young adult dystopian if you had a great
5:27
epic fantasy they want another great
5:29
epic fantasy now I know a lot of you
5:31
listen to this and you go oh my gosh but
5:33
Sara I don't want to have to be like
5:35
pigeon-holed into this one genre for the
5:37
rest of my life well the good news is
5:40
over time once you have you know give
5:43
them those five dystopian that they want
5:45
to read back to back to back and you
5:47
build up that fan base once you have
5:49
money coming in once you have you know
5:51
really honed your skill and you've
5:53
really built up that core readership you
5:55
into that series or you get far enough
5:57
down in it then you can say you know
5:59
what I'm gonna take a little bit of time
6:00
off and I'm gonna write this police
6:02
procedural that I really liked at that
6:05
point you can start to branch out a
6:06
little bit more because you have what I
6:08
call an anchor series and like I said
6:10
we're going to be talking about this a
6:12
lot over the next few weeks so go ahead
6:14
and comment below if you're interested
6:15
in hearing more about building an anchor
6:17
series but I will just tell you right
6:19
now with that type of reader behavior it
6:22
doesn't mean that you're going to be
6:24
locked into this one genre for the rest
6:26
of your life it just means that you
6:28
really need to pick one genre preferably
6:31
one series and stick with it for at
6:33
least a few years so that you can build
6:35
and I know that for some of you that's
6:37
really going to break your
6:38
heart but this is going to be the
6:40
fastest way to build your career and I
6:42
highly recommend that you choose one and
6:45
you stick with it because otherwise
6:47
you're going to be starting over with
6:48
every book you write and you're not
6:50
going to be retaining those readers
6:51
you're going to be like you know you may
6:53
have 500 fans that read this genre 200
6:56
fans that read this genre and 300 that
6:57
read this genre and there may be 10
6:59
people that are reading all three but
7:01
otherwise you've just built three
7:02
totally separate careers and none of
7:04
them are really doing that great whereas
7:05
you could have built 10,000 fans that
7:08
are liking this series with those three
7:10
books in the same genre rather than
7:12
popcorn out through all these different
7:14
genres so I know some of you will also
7:16
say but Sara what about starting a pen
7:18
name you know if I wrote three dystopian
7:20
Sauveur here and then I had a pen name
7:22
where I wrote epic fantasy you know then
7:25
I could write both things that I love
7:26
now this is actually a great idea if you
7:29
want to write two very different genres
7:30
and you want to have a pen name for each
7:33
one that's great if you're someone who
7:35
can write six books a year or four books
7:38
a year and you can flip-flop between
7:40
genres or types of points of view then
7:43
go for it you could start building those
7:45
two careers however where you run into
7:48
problems with this is especially number
7:50
one if you're really slow writer and you
7:53
can only write you know two books a year
7:54
or one book a year you're going to
7:56
really struggle if you're trying to
7:58
build two separate pen names if you're
8:00
going to build two separate pen names
8:02
also I really recommend that you start
8:04
with one it is hard enough in this
8:06
business to build one great career much
8:09
less trying to build multiple at a time
8:11
start off with something much more
8:14
attainable start off with that one great
8:16
career and once you have a handle on how
8:17
to build that you can use the knowledge
8:19
that you've gained the marketing
8:21
experience you can even use your current
8:23
fan base to launch that second career
8:25
but for now start with one and I know
8:28
that like I said there are some of you
8:30
out there that are like me they're like
8:31
but I want yes you want but if you were
8:35
here right in the beginning and I talked
8:36
about what is it you truly want out of
8:38
your career if you truly want to build a
8:40
career where you can make money writing
8:42
what you love and you can start to
8:44
support your family and you can start to
8:46
really grow that fan base that's going
8:48
to be big enough to sustain you as an
8:50
author for years to
8:51
this is the sacrifice that you need to
8:54
make which is to focus in on one genre
8:57
one series for a set period of time
9:00
until you begin to see that progression
9:02
and that growth another thing to think
9:05
about is how well can you write multiple
9:08
genres because just because you love
9:11
something doesn't mean you're
9:12
necessarily going to be great at writing
9:14
it so take this time now if you haven't
9:17
published yet and that you know clock
9:20
isn't ticking yet in terms of oh I need
9:22
to get the next book out take this time
9:24
now to write down a list of all the
9:26
different genres that you're really
9:27
interested in writing read some books in
9:30
that genre hopefully you already have
9:31
and then start practicing writing those
9:34
genres like start out writing in urban
9:36
fantasy see how that feels to you do you
9:38
like it do you like the way mysteries
9:40
field does your writing sound like it
9:42
fits into that genre and not saying like
9:44
does it do you sound just like Stephen
9:46
King but you know does it sound like
9:48
something that fits into the horror
9:49
genre or does it sound like an adult
9:51
coming-of-age or does your character
9:52
sound a lot older than that and like you
9:54
should really be writing adult because I
9:56
have definitely read people who are
9:59
writing young adult stuff that I'm like
10:02
that sounds like an old woman writing
10:04
that and it just doesn't there's
10:05
something kind of a disconnect whereas
10:08
me I kind of have the opposite I feel I
10:10
have a very young like coming-of-age
10:12
type voice to myself so when I started
10:15
trying to write like an urban fantasy
10:16
like a straight urban fantasy for
10:18
example I wasn't nailing it because I
10:21
just didn't have that sort of street
10:23
smarts tough voice that so many of the
10:26
you know urban fantasy heroines have my
10:29
heroines tend to have a very I'm looking
10:32
for my place in this world coming-of-age
10:34
style poise and so I learned over time
10:36
that this is just really where I excel
10:38
now if I really was passionate about
10:40
writing urban fantasy then I would have
10:42
to take time to hone that skill and to
10:44
learn that craft but I also moved and
10:48
gravitated toward where my talents are
10:50
and my talents are more for
10:52
coming-of-age and young adult style
10:54
voice so practice writing all those
10:57
different things see where your voice is
10:59
naturally inclined and start with start
11:02
there then you can
11:03
spend time growing those talents and
11:05
those skills over time without the
11:08
pressure of having to publish very
11:09
quickly so hopefully these tips have
11:11
really helped you and like I said I'm
11:12
going to be covering how to build an
11:14
anchor series how to choose which genre
11:16
to start with all that stuff we're going
11:17
to be covering over the next few weeks
11:19
so make sure you're subscribed but I'll
11:21
also want to always go back to this
11:23
which is what is it you want out of your
11:27
career if you don't care about the money
11:29
you don't necessarily care about growing
11:31
a fanbase in any certain period of time
11:33
all you care about is just being able to
11:35
like let loose and be free with what you
11:38
write then do your thing write what you
11:40
want to write publish it don't worry
11:42
about how quickly but I think that most
11:44
of you really want to build a career
11:47
where you're making money where you're
11:48
building a fan base where you're growing
11:50
and something that is gonna last and
11:52
grow upon itself so like 5000 sales this
11:55
year you want 10,000 next year if you
11:57
decide to write in multiple genres and
11:59
you're just putting out one book a year
12:01
in all these different genres it is
12:03
going to take you so much longer to
12:05
build that for yourself so do yourself a
12:07
favor write down those lists of all
12:09
those different genres see where it is
12:11
that you have the strongest story the
12:13
strongest voice and then commit to that
12:15
for at least the next year or two maybe
12:17
an entire series before you begin
12:19
branching out just to give you a little
12:21
bit of my own personal story that's
12:23
exactly what I did I started out with
12:25
young adult which was called the peach
12:27
Ville hajiman series and has since been
12:29
changed to the shadow demon saga but it
12:31
was all one series all one heroine the
12:34
story built upon itself you know each
12:36
you know each story built from the last
12:39
and each book ended with cliffhanger so
12:41
there was a really clear reason when
12:44
people got to the end of that first book
12:46
why they wanted to read book 2 and it
12:49
wasn't like I had this long list of all
12:51
these different genres for them to go
12:52
choose from it was very simple finished
12:55
book one here's book two and just having
12:58
that follow on and giving them a very
13:00
clear place and not giving them a bunch
13:01
of options is how I built my entire
13:04
career my first two books came out
13:06
within six weeks of each other then my
13:08
third book came out two months later and
13:10
having those somewhat rapid releases in
13:12
a single series was very clear what was
13:14
coming for me it was very clear what
13:16
genre was
13:17
and it was actually building on a single
13:18
series is how I built everything that I
13:21
have today and I continued on with that
13:23
not quite as fast because I was going
13:25
through some other things and the deeper
13:27
you get into a series the harder it can
13:28
be to write but over the course of two
13:30
years I wrote six books which for me was
13:33
the end of a major story arc then I sort
13:36
of branched out and I was able to try
13:38
different things I tried my Fairhope
13:40
series which is a contemporary new adult
13:42
more emotional small-town series I also
13:45
tried a zombie series that has witches
13:47
and this young young adult coming of age
13:49
but it has like eight different points
13:50
of view and it's in third person so it's
13:52
very different and I kind of
13:54
experimented with that for a few years
13:56
now the Fairhope series did very well
13:59
the zombie series has never quite caught
14:01
up to those other two series and part of
14:03
that is because it took me two to three
14:05
years in between releases so having
14:08
those focused releases right there in
14:10
the beginning
14:11
built what I call an anchor series for
14:13
myself that series continued to make
14:15
money while I experimented with other
14:17
things so if you're really hoping that
14:20
someday you're going to be able to write
14:21
multiple genres I highly highly
14:23
recommend to you that you pick this one
14:25
thing that you know you love enough to
14:28
stick with for the next several years
14:29
pick it focus on it don't let sadness or
14:33
destruction get to you if you need to
14:35
write something in between just don't
14:37
publish it so if you want to write two
14:38
books and you're your anchor series and
14:40
then you want to write something that's
14:41
totally different like a dystopian or
14:44
whatever write it put it to the side and
14:47
then continue writing that series that
14:50
you were working on so that you're
14:51
focusing those releases the readers know
14:53
exactly what to pick up next and you
14:55
begin to grow a lot faster then once you
14:58
have your baseline your core fan base
15:01
you're starting to bring in money you've
15:02
starting to get that career you can
15:04
begin to experiment now I can tell a
15:06
little bit more about my story in
15:08
upcoming videos about where I made a
15:10
mistake that I took too long to get back
15:12
to that core fan base but that's for
15:14
another video if you guys have enjoyed
15:16
this I certainly hope that you will give
15:18
my video a thumbs up subscribe below and
15:20
make sure that you go back and watch
15:22
that first video that I had about really
15:25
deciding what it is you want because if
15:27
you want to make decisions about what
15:28
genres you want to
15:29
right and whether you want to write in
15:32
multiple genres you really need to know
15:33
what it is you want out of this career
15:35
so I hope you'll give that a quick look
15:37
as well as it I also have some free
15:39
journaling pages to help you decide what
15:41
it is you want out of this career so I
15:43
will link all of that for you below and
15:45
if you're interested in hearing more
15:47
about how to build an anchor series and
15:49
how I built built my best-selling series

alright I hope this has been helpful and
15:55
I will see you in my next video bye

hey guys welcome back to heart
0:01
breathing's I am so excited that you
0:03
were here if you are not a subscriber
0:04
yet I would love to have you subscribe
0:06
to my channel and hit that notification
0:08
bell so that you will receive an email
0:10
or a message as soon as a new video has
0:13
come up from me because I am a working
0:15
author that is my main job I write
0:17
several books a year and so when I'm on
0:20
deadline like I am this week I can't
0:22
always get two videos out per week but I
0:25
did want to get something up for you
0:26
today I have mentioned before that I
0:29
spoke in Raleigh at the heart of
0:31
Carolina romance writers all-day
0:33
workshop this weekend and one of the
0:36
things that kept coming up was this idea
0:38
of fear and having to make decisions
0:42
that you feel will move you forward
0:44
versus just wanting to write the things
0:46
you want to write so this is obviously
0:48
something that is way more than I can
0:50
cover in just like a five minute video
0:52
but I did want to address this like
0:55
should you write for our love or should
0:56
you write for the money so if this is a
0:59
question that you've been asking
1:00
yourself stick around because I'm gonna
1:02
share some of my thoughts with you okay
1:08
so like I said I am on deadline have a
1:11
book coming out at the end of this month
1:13
that is still in edits that I need to
1:14
get to beta readers and out to my editor
1:16
so I am heading out to Hilton Head
1:19
Island tomorrow for the next five days
1:21
and while I'm there I'm hoping to do
1:23
actually my very first youtube live I
1:25
tried to do it from the hotel in Raleigh
1:26
this weekend but I couldn't get it to
1:28
connect so I'm gonna do a YouTube live
1:30
hopefully on Thursday this week so
1:32
please hit that notification bell so
1:34
that you'll be notified as soon as I go
1:35
live I'm not sure what time of day I'll
1:37
do it but I'll be showing you kind of
1:39
what I bring along with me on a writing
1:41
retreat when I'm just completely
1:43
immersing and what kind of food I eat
1:45
what my routine looks like so if you're
1:47
interested in learning more about
1:48
writing retreats and seeing an actual
1:49
author in progress on a writing retreat
1:52
then hopefully you will stick around and
1:54
subscribe to my channel but let's talk a
1:56
little bit about my thoughts on whether
1:59
you should write for love indie
2:01
published self-published for love or for
2:04
money now this is a very tricky topic
2:07
and it's actually going to be completely
2:10
independent to you as you're watching
2:13
this what
2:13
that you want most and I think that one
2:16
of the things I try to drive home to
2:17
people in my courses when I give
2:19
speeches when I'm talking to them a
2:21
one-on-one on coaching is what is it
2:23
that you want because whether or not you
2:26
go for love or money or whatever it is
2:29
it all depends on what your vision for
2:31
your life is with that being said though
2:34
who truly has a vision for their life
2:37
where they're not happy I mean yes we
2:40
might be able to look you know somewhere
2:43
into the like great beyond blue skies
2:45
whatever and be thinking about you know
2:47
movie deals and you know huge six-figure
2:50
incomes or seven-figure income going to
2:53
cry ters conferences and having everyone
2:55
go oh my gosh there he is he's the
2:57
biggest author in the whole world you
2:58
know whatever like we may have that as
3:00
our ideal vision for our career I mean
3:02
heck I'm sure JK Rowling didn't even
3:04
ever imagined there would someday be a
3:06
theme park especially when she was
3:08
rolling in hundreds of rejections for
3:10
Harry Potter she probably didn't even
3:11
have that vision for her life but she
3:14
believed in that series and she had some
3:16
kind of vision for what she wanted to
3:17
turn it into well you may also have a
3:20
similar vision for your own work or for
3:22
your own life but here's what tends to
3:25
happen we we have this vision some of us
3:28
it's as simple as I just want to make
3:29
enough money to help pay for my child's
3:32
daycare or just to contribute a little
3:34
bit to my family some of us like me do
3:37
have big visions for you know want that
3:39
seven-figure income I want a house on
3:41
the beach I want a movie deal or
3:43
actually I really really want a TV deal
3:45
so any CW or Netflix executives if
3:48
you're watching or HBO let me know
3:50
because I have a great series that would
3:51
work wonderful for TV I have these great
3:54
big grand visions and whether your
3:56
vision is something that's grand to you
3:59
is you know a couple thousand dollars a
4:01
month or grand to you is a couple
4:03
thousand dollars a day whatever that
4:05
definition is all of us do truly want to
4:08
be happy but what I find tends to happen
4:11
is as we start down this road we begin
4:14
to face a lot of fears we're creative
4:17
beings we are people who want things
4:20
very badly we put our whole selves into
4:22
what we're doing what we're working on
4:25
we
4:25
create these characters in these worlds
4:27
out of just our own imagination and we
4:29
literally pour our heart and soul into
4:31
these pages and when you start to get
4:34
that work out into the world we start to
4:37
judge ourselves based on how it's doing
4:39
and we start to see that vision way out
4:42
in the future and go I'm never going to
4:44
get there and it can feel terrifying you
4:47
know if you've been at this for a year
4:48
or even six months and you're not seeing
4:51
the progression that you want to see
4:53
that you think is going to get you down
4:55
the road to that ideal vision of your
4:57
life then it can be frankly quite
5:01
terrifying and when we're afraid we tend
5:04
to make very reactionary decisions
5:06
reacting to that fear reacting to what
5:09
we tell ourselves is true even if it's
5:12
not necessarily true so for example you
5:15
may have three or four books out in a
5:17
series and it's just not taking off the
5:18
way you wanted so in order to deal with
5:22
your fear and what you think is true you
5:24
might find your ego or your fear telling
5:27
you stories like well you know what
5:29
you're really just not that great of a
5:31
writer maybe you should try something
5:32
else or you know what maybe this genre
5:35
just doesn't sell so maybe I need to go
5:38
and write this other thing that does
5:39
sell better or and you know the stew
5:42
list could go on and on our fear
5:43
sometimes tries to convince us of these
5:45
stories and when we react to that fear
5:49
we can often make decisions that pull us
5:52
backward in our path and as we start
5:55
going down that journey of you know we
5:58
put things out we come up with this like
6:00
wide-eyed optimism I'm gonna create this
6:02
kind of career for myself and then
6:04
things don't happen as quickly as we
6:07
want or someone says something to us or
6:09
we get a bad review or anything that
6:11
triggers that fear in us it makes us
6:13
sometimes pull away from that love and
6:15
passion we had for the writing and begin
6:18
to tell ourselves stories that the only
6:21
way we're ever going to get to the money
6:23
is to back away from the love and I'm
6:26
not saying that this applies to every
6:28
single person but I see it apply to a
6:30
lot of people and it has applied to me
6:31
in various parts of my career where you
6:34
know things are things are really just
6:36
slower than I wanted them to be
6:39
but you know without really looking at
6:41
the truth which is that things just take
6:43
time to build especially in today's
6:45
overcrowded market over marketed market
6:48
it's very difficult sometimes to really
6:50
find your fan base and so when it's
6:54
going slower then you want it to you can
6:57
listen to that fear that says well you
6:58
shouldn't be writing this everybody's
7:00
making money writing this other thing
7:01
you should go write that whether you
7:03
want to or not and we start to think
7:06
that there's no way to write what you
7:08
love and make money and so these things
7:10
are two completely separate issues and
7:14
that if the money is not coming then I
7:17
have to stop writing what I love and
7:19
that is simply not true I know plenty of
7:22
people who are writing the things they
7:24
love to write and they're making money I
7:27
happen to be one of them I am writing
7:29
exactly what I want to be writing the
7:31
genre that I want to be writing and
7:33
there are so many ideas in my head I'm
7:37
not writing every single thing I want to
7:39
write all at once because that's how I
7:40
got myself in this mess of writing five
7:42
series at once which is where I started
7:44
the year now I'm down to three series
7:45
and hopefully by mid 2019 I will be down
7:48
to writing one series at a time but that
7:50
is another discussion for another day
7:52
but I put myself in kind of that
7:55
compromising position of writing so many
7:57
series because I was reacting to the
7:59
fear of my income falling and in fact
8:03
rather than increasing my income by
8:05
starting a lot of series I decreased my
8:07
income because I couldn't put out books
8:09
fast enough in a single series so I
8:11
started losing momentum and oftentimes
8:15
when we tell ourselves this story this
8:18
lie that you can't write for love and
8:21
for money at the same time we begin to
8:24
find an imbalance there and we say okay
8:26
well then I can't write what I love I'm
8:27
going to write something else or I'm
8:28
going to search for something that's
8:30
working better and we abandon a strategy
8:32
that might have been working or we don't
8:34
even actually analyze that strategy to
8:36
come up with something better we just
8:38
make a knee-jerk reaction and we turn
8:40
left and we do something completely
8:41
different thinking well you know this is
8:43
where the money will begin to come in
8:45
and I think that if you ask yourself the
8:47
question should I write for love or
8:49
should I write for money you're asking
8:51
yourself the wrong
8:52
because in the ideal vision of your life
8:55
I really believe that most of us if not
8:58
all of us want to find joy and we want
9:00
to be happy and if you are going to
9:03
tackle this very difficult career of
9:06
being an author and being an indie
9:08
author which is you know it's it's
9:10
difficult there the majority of people
9:13
do not find success doing this so if
9:16
you're going to reach for that dream
9:18
then at least be happy doing it there's
9:20
no use in trying a career where there's
9:23
no insurance there's no salary there's
9:25
no guarantees of anything and you have
9:27
to work your butt off you have to pour
9:29
your soul into it why do that if you
9:31
don't love it right if you're just doing
9:33
it for the money go out and find a job
9:35
that will pay you a salary and give you
9:37
health insurance and vacation days
9:39
because this is way too hard and
9:42
emotional of a job to not do it hoping
9:45
that along the way you're going to
9:47
actually be joyful and feel fulfilled
9:49
both emotionally and financially in this
9:54
career so it has to involve you you need
9:58
to be writing for the love but where
10:00
that becomes something a little bit
10:03
tricky is that if you are solely writing
10:06
for the love and you don't take the
10:08
business and marketing aspects into
10:10
account at all then you're going to just
10:13
put the cover that you think looks good
10:15
this is oh but this is a great scene
10:16
from the book and you know it may not
10:18
look like any other mystery covers out
10:20
there but I love it and you let you know
10:24
your own like passion for everything and
10:27
you just completely like overrule the
10:30
business side of it like putting a cover
10:32
on it that makes readers immediately go
10:34
oh that's a mystery thriller like I know
10:36
what that is if you if you put your
10:39
blinders on and you just refuse at all
10:41
to put any of the business and marketing
10:44
side of it in there then you're gonna
10:46
have a more difficult time selling the
10:48
kinds of books you love to write it has
10:50
to be a balance if you truly want to be
10:53
happy you have to be writing something
10:55
that you enjoy something that you love
10:57
but you have to either you know I was
11:00
saying this this weekend and so did New
11:02
York Times bestselling author Sabrina
11:04
Jeffries who was also
11:06
one of the speakers this weekend she
11:07
said ideas are a dime a dozen for those
11:10
of us who are creators that is so true
11:11
like we have more ideas than we could
11:14
possibly write in a lifetime most of us
11:16
so really there are lots of ideas that
11:20
you could love writing sorry the Sun
11:22
again in this room is a little bit crazy
11:24
so it got a little darker but there are
11:26
lots of ideas that you could love to
11:28
write and be passionate about writing
11:30
pick the most marketable idea that you
11:33
could write if you can think of a series
11:36
I have an entire video series on writing
11:39
a best-selling series and branding it
11:41
well and packaging it well so not only
11:44
write something that you love as
11:46
marketable as possible you have to think
11:49
about the reader to some degree what
11:52
does the reader expect in that genre if
11:54
it's a romance they're going to expect
11:56
that the couple ends up together and has
11:58
a happily ever after at the end that is
11:59
the very definition of romance if you're
12:02
writing a crime novel they're going to
12:03
expect to know who did it at the end but
12:06
every genre has its expectations its
12:10
tropes the things that it follows and
12:12
I'm not saying you have to absolutely
12:14
everything in your book has to be copied
12:16
from someone else because I don't
12:18
believe in that at all but what I am
12:19
saying is if you're going to be an indie
12:21
author and you're going to be the
12:23
publisher then you have to do the kinds
12:25
of things that a publisher does which is
12:27
you write the art into your book but
12:30
then you have to step away from it once
12:32
it's done and look at it like a
12:34
publisher so instead of putting a cover
12:36
on it that you love you need to put a
12:37
cover on that book that readers of that
12:40
genre are going to love and so you have
12:42
to market it and package it in a way
12:45
that everyone who reads that genre is
12:47
going to immediately see it and say well
12:49
that's obviously a urban fantasy with a
12:52
kick-ass heroine because it looks like
12:55
that and you know you can be unique but
12:58
not stand out so much that people can't
13:00
tell what genre it is and these are just
13:02
the kinds of things that you'll need to
13:03
learn in order to make the money but you
13:06
can still write what you love and make
13:08
money so it's not an either/or thing it
13:11
really is a synergy and a balance how do
13:14
you write what you love and then learn
13:16
to package it too
13:17
look at it in such a way that you can
13:20
learn to make a living at this and
13:22
sometimes it's really just a matter of
13:24
being a little bit more patient and
13:26
following a set strategy rather than
13:29
like I'm gonna write two books and if it
13:31
doesn't work I'm going to freak out and
13:33
I'm gonna have a fear reaction and I'm
13:34
gonna start writing something completely
13:35
different but it is almost never ever
13:38
ever the case that you have to stop
13:41
writing something that you love so that
13:43
you can write something you don't love
13:44
just to make money that is a little bit
13:47
of a Sarah Canon soap box that I will
13:49
stand on today because I often hear
13:51
people giving advice to indie authors
13:54
who are struggling and they say to them
13:55
well you can't treat this like an art
13:57
this is not about you as an artist this
14:00
is a business and you need to write to
14:01
mark it and you need to blahdy blahdy
14:03
blah and what they mean by writing to
14:05
market is picking the most popular genre
14:08
and writing to that trend there are a
14:10
lot of disadvantages to writing too what
14:13
is the most popular trend and if you
14:14
guys want to see a video on the
14:16
disadvantage of writing to trends then I
14:19
would be happy to talk about that from
14:21
my point of view but when those of us
14:24
who really know the business talk about
14:26
marketing your books or writing to
14:28
market we're not usually talking about
14:30
writing to trends it's two completely
14:32
separate things so when I talk about you
14:34
know making writing the most marketable
14:36
idea that you will love to write I'm
14:38
talking about taking all of your ideas
14:41
that you love and doing a little bit of
14:43
market research which one of these is
14:44
selling best like will you write this
14:47
middle grade zombie series or what about
14:50
this why a which is an vampire series
14:53
that could be really cool too and after
14:56
some research you may find that hey both
14:57
of these are viable so which one do I
14:59
feel like I want to write most but you
15:02
always have to consider your own love
15:04
for it I would never say oh you should
15:07
just pick a random genre that's like
15:09
doing really great and you should just
15:11
write to that trend even if you hate it
15:13
like don't write reverse harem romance
15:16
if you don't like reading reverse hair
15:18
of no romance or you have no interest in
15:20
that genre just so you can make money
15:22
because you're not going to be building
15:23
anything that leads you toward that
15:25
long-term vision of your life and you're
15:27
not going to be writing something that
15:29
brings you joy that
15:30
is all the time I have today to kind of
15:32
talk about that but the main message
15:33
that I want to get across is that if you
15:36
are asking the question should I write
15:38
for love or should I write for money
15:40
you're asking yourself the wrong
15:41
question what you should be asking is
15:43
what is the most marketable way that I
15:45
can write what I love and still make
15:49
money because I promise you it is a
15:50
hundred percent possible to write the
15:52
kinds of stories that you are passionate
15:54
about even if it may not be the
15:56
trendiest genre of all time you can find
15:58
ways to write what you want to write and
16:02
what you love to write that will fulfill
16:03
your soul and your artists heart and
16:06
still make money doing it
16:08

hey guys welcome back to heart breathing's I have a juicy topic for you here today because everybody in the
0:06
polishing space seems to be talking a lot about rapid release so today we're
0:12
gonna talk about should you rapid release your books is this a valuable plan or a viable plan for you in 2020
0:19
and moving forward and most importantly what are the dangers of rapid release so
0:25
let's get started so rapid release when
What is rapid release
0:32
it comes to indie publishing is kind of a buzz term lately though a lot of people are talking about and what it
0:39
means when you're talking about rapid release is rapidly releasing your books especially books in a series one after
0:46
the other after the other now I've talked about this on my channel a little bit before that one of the ways
0:52
that I found success all the way back in 2010 was by essentially rapid releasing
0:58
the first three books in my shadow demon saga which back then was called the peaceful high demons series
1:03
I had a release in October another release mid December and then a release in February so it was about six to eight
1:10
weeks between releases after that I started spreading things out a little
1:15
bit because the books got longer the world got more intense and it just became harder or more difficult to write
1:21
those books so then I started spreading them out several months if not a year between them so this strategy even
1:29
though I didn't know as a strategy at the time worked really well to launch my career and all the way back since the
1:35
beginning of indie publishing in eBook form this has been a really great way to
1:42
launch your career and to launch a series in fact Lilliana Hart who is a New York Times
1:49
and USA Today best-selling author started kind of her own thing that at
1:56
one point was called Lilliana nirvana where she actually pre wrote
2:01
it was five books and released them all on the same day or really close within
2:08
each other no I could probably go google it and try to find it but basically what you need to know is she rapidly or she
2:13
wrote several books held them back and then rapidly released them either dropping them all in the same day or
2:20
like really close together thereafter then what she also did which was really
2:25
smart is she actually held one book back so if she released all five then she had
2:31
a sixth book actually ready to go so that when she dropped the fifth book she
2:37
could be promoting book six that was already written and secretly in the back
Lilliana Nirvana
2:42
end writing book seven so that really worked well for her and then after that huge drop where she made a big splash in
2:50
the world of self-publishing she was kind of launched as a career and a
2:55
successful author from then on and she was able to set up a schedule for herself that was sustainable where she
3:02
was always kind of like one book ahead for a long time or you know able to write that next book and publish it
3:09
before you know too many months had gone by and that worked extremely well a lot
3:15
of people over the last several years have taken this to heart and said okay what I'm gonna do is Lilliana Nirvana or
3:22
you know rapid releasing where I'm gonna hold books back I'm gonna reap rewrite them I'm gonna hold them back and then
3:29
I'm gonna wrap and release them either by launching all of those five books or whatever books on the same day or
3:35
putting them out a week apart or even a month apart or whatever it's going to be and everybody has kind of had different
3:41
strategies with that and there are varying levels of success with it so that's basically rapid release and I
3:48
would say rapid release could mean anything back-to-back within you know either from the same day to a week apart
3:55
to a month apart all the way out to probably six to eight weeks apart is
4:00
considered rapid release once you get to like three months apart I would say people are no longer considering that
4:06
right release so typically right now you're seeing this a lot in Amazon's Kindle
4:12
unlimited which is their exclusivity program where you have to be all-in on Amazon and you can't sell your books
4:18
anywhere else and then readers who have a Kindle unlimited or kayuu subscription for I believe $10 a month can download
4:26
your book for free and read it within that program so a lot of people are doing this now let's talk first about
4:32
the pros so right now at least as we're sitting here in 2020 there is no doubt
4:38
about it that rapid release is really good for the algorithms and this goes for all of
4:44
the vendors out there not just Amazon but like I said you're seeing this a lot on Amazon because of the Kindle
4:50
unlimited program and the way those free ebooks work and the algorithms work there so basically if you release a lot
4:57
of books rapidly and you get readers to you know catch on to it and read them
5:03
you start to gain momentum within the vendor itself meaning that because of
Momentum
5:09
how well your book is being read and how quickly you're getting books out there and how many times how many people are
5:14
seeing your book you're building momentum on that platform really really fast and the more momentum you build and
5:21
the faster you build that momentum the more that vendor is going to surface your book to new readers so for example
5:30
let's just take cameras on because this is where it's most popular you release a new book in a series every 30 days in a
5:39
six month period so every 30 days you have a new release coming out in your
5:44
let's say werewolf shifter series so January 10th February 10th March 10th
5:49
you're launching a brand new book which is rapid releasing them one after the other because you start to naturally
5:55
build momentum with readers going oh there's another one ooh there's another one you start to build up that momentum at the vendor as
6:02
well so that means when someone types in something like your keyword like hot werewolf shifter your book is going to
6:10
show up more often in search which means that new readers will find it more easily because you're sort of playing
6:17
that algorithm there's a lot more there and there are a lot more people more qualified to talk about that like
6:23
maybe David Dahlgren or Mark Dolson or Chris Fox maybe you can talk about that a little bit better than I am cuz I'm
6:29
not a super like math person but basically all you need to know is the faster you release your books typically
6:36
the more momentum you'll gain because of the way the algorithms work and the way reader
6:42
behavior works so in short one of the biggest pros is that if you release your
6:48
books more quickly many times you're you are likely to be discovered by newer
6:53
readers faster another Pro is that we are currently living in a society where
6:59
people love to binge things they love to binge read they love to binge watch they
7:04
love to binge play but basically readers really are enjoying binging series the
7:12
same way a whole season launches on Netflix in a day and you've been watched the entire season a lot of readers want
7:18
to find series that are like 5 or 6 books big enough to get your sink your teeth into and then they want to read
7:24
them all really quickly a lot of readers are losing their patience for especially in the readers in particular are losing
7:32
their patience for series that don't have a release for 8 months or a year or a year and a half because they want that
7:39
book right now and there are so many authors who are launching those books really really quickly and either really
7:44
writing fast or utilizing ghost writers to get their books out quickly that readers are starting to get impatient
7:51
and this is not all true of all readers but it is true of especially Kindle
7:56
unlimited readers and other types of readers who are able to binge read a lot of books in a short period of time so
8:03
you would find a lot of favor with readers that are looking for their next fix so to speak because they're going to
8:10
get your book right away and not have to wait for it so that can be one of the pros is that you're going to gain the
8:16
favor of readers that enjoy binge reading a lot of content because you're
8:21
coming out with books pretty rapidly you're also staying on top of mind so readers don't
8:27
have time to forget you essentially you give them what they want 30 days later you give them another one and they're
Time to Forget
8:33
constantly being reminded that hey this author is really good I really enjoy this series and you don't you're not
8:39
giving them a lot of time to forget about you because what happens in indie publishing when you've got tons and tons
8:45
of books to choose from a reader will you know like a series they enjoy it they've read the first three or four
8:51
books it's really great may not be the best thing they've ever read in their life but they love it but then there
8:57
comes this big lull like a year or 12 you know 14 months 16 months in between books and in that
9:04
amount of time they have moved on to other series other authors other things that they love so by the time the next
9:11
book comes out in this one series that they used to like they've kind of moved on and they've forgotten about it plus a
9:17
lot of times readers are like oh do I really want to pick up that next book because then it might be another two
9:22
years while I'm waiting this is a big thing that's happened in my own career is I started out with that kind of rapid
9:28
release every couple of months then it got longer and longer between and then a few years ago I hit a really rough spot
9:35
I've talked about this a few times on my channel so we'll go into it too much where I was writing too many series they
9:41
couldn't really keep up so I fell behind on a lot of my series and a lot of readers just kind of fell off of my
9:48
series because I wasn't getting those books out fast enough so it is a very real danger when you put too much time
9:55
in between books in a series especially if your series was not that popular to begin with like let's say you only had
10:02
10,000 readers which really 10,000 readers is a lot but if you only had 10,000 readers read through book four
10:08
and then you take two years to get book five out you're gonna lose maybe potentially half of those readers so the
10:15
only audience you have for book 5 is 5000 previous readers and whatever new
10:20
reader she can bring into your series whereas if you had released that book 5 within say 3 or 4 months of a book 4 you
Pros and Cons
10:28
might have been able to retain 80 90 even a hundred percent of that readership so taking a lot of time
10:34
between you can see readers drop off so the pro of rapid releasing is that you
10:40
get to hold on to those readers that you've already gained and keep them interested in your books it's also a way
10:47
to make a splash very quickly in your career so let's say you're coming from nothing
10:52
if you put one book out there a few people like it but then boom there's another book those people will begin
10:59
talking about it and they'll say oh you've got to read this book this series is getting really good then book 3 comes
11:04
out and then more and more people start talking about it so you can build up word-of-mouth very quickly especially
11:10
when you combine that with the fact that the algorithms tend to love rapid release so all of that sounds really
11:17
encouraging like yes Sarah I am all-in let's rapid release these books but hold
11:23
on just a minute there are a lot of people talking about the benefits of rapid release but what I found is that
11:30
very few people are talking about the dangers of rapid releasing your books because there are some very real dangers
11:38
that you need to take into consideration so let's talk about what's not so good
11:43
about rapid release so there are actually a lot more cons than what you
11:48
might realize one of them being that let's say you're not a super fast writer
11:54
and your plan is to actually write a bunch of books like take the next year or two or even three I've heard some
12:01
people saying to pre write five or six books or more so that you can make this
12:07
rapid release splash so what's happening here is you are investing a ridiculous
12:13
amount of time money and energy into a series that is as yet totally unproven
12:21
so what I mean by that is readers haven't had a chance to read your book one and you're already or you know
12:27
planning to work on 5 6 7 8 & 9 well sometimes a book series will start
12:32
and even though you've got the algorithms behind you and all that other thing none of the but release strategy guarantees that
12:40
readers are going to love your series maybe it's not going to be right for the market right now maybe it's just not
12:46
going to be on trend maybe there's something about your heroine people don't like so let's say you are gonna
12:53
write eight books and it's going to take you two years to write them so you write
12:58
these eight books you spend all this time working on it in the meantime because you're going to rapid release
13:05
these books every thirty days you're going to release a new book you also have to go ahead before you're making
13:11
any money and invest in cover art and edits and maybe even some advertising to
13:18
launch that first book or whatever you're going to do so you're spending quite a bit of time and if this is your
13:24
very first book or your first series of books you might also be investing in things like a new computer or software
13:32
for your business a new website there's gonna be a lot of upfront costs and you're not making any money yet because
13:38
you're holding all those books back now it might pay off for you in a huge way to have all eight books of those splash
13:46
the scene and all come out within eight months of each other however you're taking a huge risk here
Risks
13:52
because maybe you've just put in ten thousand dollars and two years of your
13:57
time and book 1 launches and you get either crickets because people are kind
14:03
of not into that genre or whatever else but potentially a lot of bad reviews that say something like I don't really
14:10
get into this heroine she's kind of annoying me or oh I did not like this romance that romance was so unrealistic
14:17
and now you find out that there are fundamental flaws in book 1 of that
14:22
series that you've just spent two years of your life and ten thousand dollars getting together you haven't proven that
14:28
series you haven't really shown readers what that series is all about you're putting all your chips into it hoping
14:34
and maybe even naively believing that because you're using this rapid release
14:40
strategy that it's just going to catapult you to end instant fame but the truth is that even really talented
14:47
writers sometimes will not hit the mark when it comes to a series that resonates or heroin
14:53
that people like one of the benefits of say releasing one or two books rapidly
14:59
and then slowing down as you're writing them is that you get a chance to get reader feedback on that now if you're
15:07
holding books back of course you can get editor feedback you can get beta reader or critique reader feedback that's still
15:13
not the same thing as releasing that book to the public at large and seeing what takes off or what doesn't
15:18
plus if you don't know if you're a great writer or not you haven't really tested
15:23
the waters to see if people resonate with your fiction and you haven't really spent a lot of time and say editing your
15:29
book or you're trying to do things in a cheaper way by not using an editor you can spend two or three years of your
15:35
life writing a series that frankly isn't very good and you won't even know it and
15:40
know where you need to improve because you're holding this book back for rapid release and this is a big danger I think
15:48
that a lot of people like I said believe that because they're using this strategy that has worked for many people that
15:53
their books are naturally going to take off and it's gonna be the one thing that makes the whole difference but that's
15:58
why I want to talk about these dangers that you know until that series is proven like for example I have several
16:04
series my shadow demon saga has sold a half a million copies it's a super super
16:09
popular but on the other hand I'm working on book three right now of a series that is a zombie which you know
16:18
apocalyptic fantasy that honestly has never taken off I'm rebranding it I'm
16:24
putting out the last book in the series and kind of gonna give it one last hurrah I didn't use rapid release
16:30
strategy but that book even though it has good reviews that series has not really taken off and I think part of it
16:36
is because my core readership maybe isn't that interested in zombies plus
16:41
it's multiple POV it's third person point of view so maybe some of those things have been things my readers or
16:49
the types of readers that I'm aiming for don't really love well what if I had spent five years working on eight books
16:55
in that series and put it out only to find that it does not sell that is a Hugh
17:00
you drift and not just the time involved but the amount of money that I would have had to spend just to launch that
The biggest risk
17:06
series off the ground so that can be a huge risk and for me this is actually
17:11
the biggest risk so be careful that you don't fall prey to this idea that because I'm using the strategy it's
17:19
going to make everything work because your series might not work your heroin might not work and you won't know it
17:25
until after you've spent all this time and all this money another risk is that you might be losing a certain magical
17:32
element of word-of-mouth and anticipation for your readers now when
17:37
you rapid release at the beginning of a series you get momentum going with word of mouth and it's great but when you
17:43
really say five books in a series and they all came out within three or four months you don't give readers time to really
17:50
like soak that up and start telling their friends before it's already over and the momentum is gone so what you're
17:56
gonna see in that case sorry if you can hear the plane going overhead what you're gonna see in that case is a
18:01
really big spike potentially and then a complete drop-offs because you're not giving people time to anticipate that
18:07
last book in a series or the next thing coming like think back to some of your favorite traditionally published series
18:14
and having to wait like a year or six months for that next book to come out and you talk to people you got on forums
18:20
you got on social media you read it again you read it again you read it again you talk to your friends and there's all this momentum building well
18:26
when you have five books in the series and they all come out on the same day and there's nothing next coming after it
18:32
except a new series that you're gonna take two years off to write you miss out
18:37
on that anticipation and that excitement now for some people you think it's okay
Reader loyalty
18:44
to miss out on that because I will have this huge spike in the beginning and that may be your strategy for your
18:50
career however I personally feel and this is something not a lot of authors talk about and maybe it's just my
18:56
opinion but I personally feel that reader loyalty true reader loyalty is
19:02
what is going to get you to the type of career where you are making six figures consistently year after year after year
19:09
so in just having that spike where our readers read your five books and then move on to the next series like they binge read you
19:16
but they're not spending a lot of time with you they're just spending like a weekend binge reading all five of your
19:22
books and then you have nothing else to offer them because they all came out really fast they're not anticipating they're not waiting they're not thinking
19:28
about you they just read it all at once and now next weekend they're gonna move onto somebody else's series the danger
19:35
there is that that reader you didn't hook them in to be a royal loyal reader for life sure you got their $10 or their
19:42
kayuu page reads but you didn't capture them to be your loyal reader right or
19:49
die no matter what you have coming out next however when you have readers that
19:55
are you know willing to wait like if you have readers that binge read the first three or four books and they're waiting
20:01
on book five for a couple months you're always in the back of their mind thinking oh let me check on that next
20:06
book let me see how it's going and then book five comes out and they loved it now they're waiting for book six and then you become a part of their lives
20:13
for the next five or six years as they're reading through your series so I think that when you wrap and release
20:19
something and drop it all really really fast but you don't have a long-term game plan for what comes next
20:25
or that series is over really fast sometimes you can miss out on the truly loyal readers which also brings up this
20:32
thought that I think a lot of people don't really go through in their minds when they're planning rapid release is
20:38
what comes next for you because anybody can take a you know a extended period of
What comes next
20:45
time and write multiple books like maybe it'll take you eight years straight eight books but you could sit back and
20:51
write those eight books and hold them and then watch them all in one year if you wanted to but then what comes next
20:58
if it takes you a year to write a book you're gonna launch those eight books and then you're gonna have at least a
21:04
year if not another eight years of waiting while you write your next series
21:10
so your career would look something like this where you're going deeper and deeper into the hole as you like prepay
21:15
for all of these covers and everything and then maybe a big spike as those eight books come out and then it's just
21:21
gonna go right back to where it was and you're not going to see that consistency of momentum because you launched
21:27
everything and then you had nothing else to offer them so back when I was talking about what Liliana Hart did she rapid
21:35
released those books but she was very smart and that she was thinking beyond
21:40
that what comes next for her she had a book in the hole so to speak so she
21:46
would wrap and release those books but she had another book ready to go and she waited a little bit of time now that
21:52
she's got those readers interested she kept them on the hook for a little bit of time before she launched that next
21:57
book and while she was holding on to that next book she was writing the next one so she was kind of always ahead I
22:03
don't know if that's where she is now still anymore Liliana if you ever gonna hope that these videos let us know in
22:09
the comments I doubt she watches my videos but that was a very smart business strategy so if you are thinking
Longterm plan
22:15
about doing a rapid release strategy I implore you to think about what is
22:21
your long-term plan for that because what I see a lot of people doing is prewriting a bunch of books that takes
22:28
them two or three years and then when they start launching them they're not holding anything back and so they think
22:36
that what they're gonna do is they're gonna launch a book a month and during those eight months that those books are
22:42
coming out they're going to write the next one right but what happens is if you're used to spending all of your time
22:49
on the writing the minute you get into launch mode and you're launching a new
22:55
book every single month you've got the promotion's the ads the emails that are coming in the fan social media you've
23:01
got all this business stuff you were never dealing with before and it makes it really difficult to focus enough to
23:08
write that next book so you're going to go from having all your time to write the next book to having almost no time
23:14
to write that next book so it's foolish to think that you're going to take two years to write eight books and then
23:20
you're going to write another eight within those eight months or another two or four books within those eight months when you're launching
23:26
because that launch period is going to be crazy it's going to be distracting
23:31
it's going to be difficult writing time it might be an emotional roller coaster because the sales aren't quite what you
23:36
expected or you're getting bad reviews it's just going to be difficult to write so you need to think about what's coming
23:42
next and potentially hold even more books back and give that a little bit of leeway a little bit of breathing room so
23:49
that you can think about how to sustain your career long term another downside
Cultivating a voracious reader
23:54
that people don't often talk about is when you wrap and release your books that fast in boom boom boom boom you are
24:00
cultivating a certain kind of reader you're cultivating the kind of reader that like I said enjoys binge reading
24:07
content and then moving on to the next thing it's a special type of voracious reader that will you know is always
24:13
looking for those big chunks of things to read because they may read like two or three hundred books a year but what
24:19
you're doing is you're training that reader that hey I come out with a book every month look for my book guess what
24:25
a new book every every month on the 10th the same way that hopefully you've been looking forward to my videos every
24:30
Thursday or every so often once a week but when you are putting out books that
24:36
quickly and then suddenly you drop off because oh you now got to go back and write new books because you didn't have
24:43
them in the hole or you aren't able to sustain the level or the speed at which you are writing before suddenly you know
24:51
you may have a period of time where people think oh what happened to that author let me go check let me go check and then they're not hearing from you
24:57
they're not hearing from you they're not hearing from you where'd she go and then you've cultivated a type of reader that
25:03
is used to moving on to the next thing and the next thing and they read things very quickly so it's gonna happen that a
25:09
lot of readers are going to drop off much faster than they would have if you were giving them books consistently over
25:15
time because if that reader only spent like one week with you or two months with you they're going to be a lot less
25:21
loyal so unless you can sustain that level the minute you drop off and you're
25:26
publishing more slowly a lot of those readers are going to drop off too so you would have spent years in the making to
25:32
build momentum that you can't sustain and that is a very real danger another big danger is burnout so even if
25:41
you think oh I can write eight books in two years or whatever the number is if you haven't had any positive feedback
25:47
within those two years you're gonna have put everything you have into it and you're gonna have this whirlwind of a
25:54
time as you're launching this book a roller coaster of emotions that is very often going to lead to burnout
Burnout
26:05
another well-known author recently came out and said that she's going to take an indefinite break because she loves
26:12
writing but for the past several years has not been able to write her own books because she couldn't keep up with the
26:18
demands of rapid release schedule and not only was she not able to write her own books and was having two more manage
26:24
her ghostwriters her team of ghost writers but she had gained an extreme amount of weight and was extremely
26:31
depressed so it didn't matter that the money was coming in or that the fans were coming in she was unhappy and I
26:36
think a lot of times we don't talk about this and indie publishing we talk about the money the marketing the strategy and
26:43
all that stuff but we don't talk about are you happy doing this because in my
26:48
opinion none of it matters if you're not happy and joyful there are so many jobs
26:53
that you could do out there there are so many things you could do with your life that you could just punch the clock come
26:58
home do what you want to do have a happy life with your family if all you care about is making money there are lots of
27:04
ways to make money if you're going to be a writer because you love to write then put your heart and soul into it and
27:11
don't give that up because you're so worried about how much money am I making how successful am I I need the hustle
27:18
hustle hustle or comparing yourself to other people and thinking that you have to release your books really really fast
27:23
to be relevant there is no doubt that releasing your books more quickly right
27:29
now in today's market as an indie is beneficial to your career it absolutely is in so many ways but it's not worth it
27:37
if you're just gonna burn out or if you're gonna write crappy books because you're writing too fast and that of
27:42
course please don't take it as me saying that people who write fast are writing crappy books because that's not the
27:48
truth for everyone but for me for example if I tried to write ten books in a year there is no way those books would
27:54
be quality books because I am not that fast of a writer if you are more power to you but many people right now are
28:01
writing beyond the level of sustainability because they're scared or
28:06
they're trying to keep up or they're worried more about rapid release than
28:12
they are about sustainable writing and sustainable career a final con that I'm
28:18
gonna mention real quick it's just that you know what if you come up with a series of books that you think are like
28:24
really gonna be great written to market really gonna be like oh this is the hot thing right now and then it takes you
28:30
even six months to a year to two years to write that series guess what the
28:36
market will have changed so especially if you said okay I'm gonna go ahead and get these covers and I'm going to
28:42
strategize and you know brainstorm the actual series based on how the market is right now into 2020 and that series
28:50
isn't going to come out till 2023 you're already going to be behind now with
28:55
traditional publishing things are different because it does sometimes take a year or two for those books to get
29:01
published but trap up is a completely different animal than indie publishing
29:06
and readers who read indie books are often very different from the readers who read traditional published books
29:12
there are of course those who read both but a lot of indie readers are on two
29:17
different market trends very very quickly so if you come up with an entire series now and you dedicate your entire
29:23
life over the next three years to writing it chances are especially if you
29:28
are trying to write to trend that by the time you get those books out the trends will have changed and you will have just
29:34
spent three years writing something that is no longer viable in the market at least not the way that you originally
29:41
expected now as we close up I just want to give you what I personally would
29:46
recommend because I think that rapid release is still a great way to launch your career I highly recommend this idea
29:55
of rapid releasing meaning 30 60 or 90 days for your first three books so like
30:03
maybe book one comes out now in 60 days book two comes out in 60 days after that
30:09
book 3 comes out so within the course of these hundred and twenty days you've had three books out then after book three in
30:16
your series if it is a longer series you can start to space things out three four or whatever amount of months it means
30:24
for you to keep a sustainable and joyful career for yourself I think that is a much better strategy
30:31
for some people what's sustainable for you is to continue to put out a new book every two months or a new book every
30:37
single 30 days but if you know that you are just not able to write quality books
30:43
at that level of 30 days apiece or 60 days apiece then don't try to do it
30:49
don't try to hold back so many books that you could release a book every month or whatever if it's not going to be sustainable long term for me I think
30:57
my realistic schedule would be four books a year maybe that's going to be pushing it with my baby at home so maybe
31:04
three books a year is gonna be my max for a while until she's in school so for me to try to come up with a rapid
31:11
release schedule that puts me you know at ten books a year I already know I'm
31:16
gonna be burned out or putting out books that aren't quality so think about what's your sustainable pace like
31:22
realistically what's your sustainable place and then come up with a strategy especially if
31:27
you're just launching a career or a series that gets those first two or three books out quickly and then spread
31:33
them out to the level of sustainable writing for yourself where you're going to be able to take care of your mental
31:39
health and continue to enjoy writing your books I know that right now many of
31:44
us in terms of indie publishing if you're really into reading about it seeing what other people are doing we
31:50
feel the pressure to write fast but I just want to be a voice here to tell you that though there can be a lot of pros
31:57
to putting out books quickly or to writing fast in the end none of it matters if you're burned out if you're
32:04
sick if you put yourself into a terrible terrible depression it doesn't matter
32:10
how fast books come out because you're going to end up leaving the writing career altogether or disappearing for a
32:16
while I see it happen over and over and over again find what is sustainable for
32:21
you stop comparing yourself to everyone else stop listening to stories are
32:26
telling yourself stories that if I don't write faster everything's going to fall apart because that's not serving you all
32:31
that feeling is making you you know get tensed and scared of everything try to let go
32:38
of the fear that I have to write really fast and if I don't everything's gonna fall apart and instead start getting
32:45
back to the joy of writing figuring out what you really want to do that's sustainable and joyful for you and
32:51
release at that schedule if you can hold a few books back I say two or three is
32:56
plenty to wrap and release like 30 60 or 90 days apart those first three books
33:02
and then spaced it out to the level of your own personal sustainability sure
33:07
you may not find as much of a spike of success as some of these people that are putting out ten books a year or ten
33:13
books in a month or whatever they're doing but you will find a sweet spot of success for yourself where you're not
33:20
going to burn out and you're not going to fall into depression and let me tell you that is important so always pay
33:26
attention to your own joy and your own mental health alright guys that's all I have to say for now about rapid release
Outro
33:32
I hope that you've enjoyed this video I know it's a little bit controversial but let me know in the comments what you think of this I know that I will
33:39
definitely be planning to do a similar type of release schedule with the first three books wrap and releasing and then
33:44
spacing it out when I'm able to start my new series either at the end of this year or next year so hopefully you'll

[Music]

hey guys welcome back to heart
0:01
breathing's this is gonna be a little
0:02
bit of a shorter video today because as
0:04
you can see there are boxes everywhere
0:07
this is my last day in this house that I
0:10
have loved so much and we are moving on
0:12
to a new adventure or a new place and
0:15
I'm excited about it but there's a lot
0:17
going on so I'm going to keep this one
0:18
short but today we're going to talk
0:20
about how to not feel so overwhelmed in
0:23
your life so like I said I've got a lot
0:30
going on right now not only am I getting
0:33
close to eight months pregnant but I'm
0:36
also in the middle of a move my HP 90
0:39
course launches tomorrow night and the
0:42
movers are coming tomorrow morning so
0:43
there's a lot going on in my life and as
0:45
I've been kind of posting about it and
0:47
sharing I've had a lot of you who have
0:50
emailed me and said how are you doing so
0:53
much because I feel overwhelmed and let
0:56
me tell you something I am not naturally
0:59
it may look like oh I've got it together
1:02
or I'm getting a lot done but I am NOT
1:04
naturally a doer in this way I spent a
1:08
lot of my life being somebody who was
1:11
disappointed in myself and who was never
1:13
living up to my potential in any way and
1:15
I think I hit this point in my life
1:18
where I said I'm just done being that
1:20
person because I have all these big
1:23
dreams and I wasn't going after them
1:26
because I felt overwhelmed and I felt
1:29
like I couldn't do it and so every time
1:32
I would start to head for this big dream
1:36
like oh I want to be a full time writer
1:38
or I want to live in a house near the
1:40
beach or I really wish we could go on
1:42
this bigger trip or I wish we could have
1:44
more income or I wish my husband could
1:46
quit his job and not have to be in a
1:49
soul-sucking job that he hates I wish we
1:51
could have a family life that was you
1:53
know both of us happy doing what we
1:54
loved so every time I bound these big
1:57
dreams I would start to feel overwhelmed
2:00
by them because a lot of times when you
2:03
look at what other people have
2:05
accomplished or you look at this big
2:07
overarching goal and you start to
2:10
research it or you start to plan how
2:12
your
2:13
gonna get there or dream how you're
2:14
gonna get there it can seem like where
2:16
you are to where you want to go is such
2:20
a huge like Grand Canyon event just so
2:24
much space in between you with all this
2:26
rocky terrain and all of these issues
2:28
and all of these obstacles in your way
2:29
that it can feel like I'm never gonna do
2:33
it it's never gonna happen so why even
2:35
try I've talked about this a lot in my
2:38
last couple of videos as well about how
2:40
to get motivated and my own personal
2:41
productivity journey but I feel like
2:44
there's still so much more to say about
2:46
this because I know that there are many
2:48
of you kind of caught in this pattern as
2:50
well and I want you to know that I have
2:52
been there and there's still days where
2:54
I struggle with it as well myself I'm
2:56
certainly not perfect I'm not getting
2:57
everything done like you know I haven't
3:00
been publishing I haven't published a
3:02
single book this year I published five
3:03
books last year was like my most
3:05
productive year of all time and this
3:07
year I've published nothing so I'm not
3:09
accomplishing everything in my life but
3:11
I think that I don't even know anybody
3:13
who's doing every single tiny little
3:15
thing but the key is that I don't feel
3:19
overwhelmed I'm not snapping at my
3:21
husband I'm not bitter about anything I
3:24
have some moments where things do start
3:26
to still feel overwhelming but I can
3:28
pull back and I can feel gratitude for
3:31
what I have and I get grounded and
3:33
censored again so what I wanted to share
3:35
with you today from my own experience is
3:37
how I got to this point where I'm no
3:40
longer feeling so overwhelmed by how
3:42
much there is to do how much other
3:44
people are accomplishing when I feel
3:46
like I'm not and you know this feeling
3:49
that I'm not going to get where I want
3:51
to go or that I'm running out of time
3:53
do any of you guys ever feel that let me
3:55
know in the comments if you feel like oh
3:56
my gosh I'm already 30 or I'm turning 35
3:59
or 40 or 50 and I am not at all where I
4:03
thought I would be and I feel like I'm
4:05
running out of time to hit my goals or
4:06
there's all these people who are
4:08
self-publishing and making full time
4:10
incomes and I feel like I'm so far
4:12
behind I'm never gonna get there that
4:14
was kind of a perpetual feeling for me
4:16
was I'm behind I'm behind and I felt
4:19
that way all the time and that led to my
4:21
feeling of overwhelm and failure
4:23
honestly so I just wanted to share with
4:25
you real quick while I had a few
4:27
minutes my husband just loaded up our
4:29
Jeep and took it to the new house with
4:31
my son's fish and some things like that
4:33
so I've got a few minutes to record
4:34
before I have to finish packing up this
4:36
office this is actually the last room in
4:38
the house that needs to be done because
4:40
there's more stuff in this room probably
4:44
what I double than any other room in the
4:46
house so I have a lot of stuff in my
4:48
office but I'm excited to setup the new
4:51
space and let me know down below if you
4:52
guys would like to see an office tour
4:54
when I do get the new office set up but
4:56
anyway what I wanted to share with you
4:58
today just real quick
4:59
is how I got to this point where no
5:01
matter what's going on no matter how
5:03
many things seemed to be piling up I
5:05
never hit that point of feeling super
5:08
overwhelmed and if I do I come back to a
5:11
very centered and very joyful place very
5:13
quickly so here's how I achieved that so
5:16
one of the first things that I did was I
5:18
really examined what it is I wanted from
5:21
my life and if you've taken any of my
5:24
courses you guys already know that I'm
5:25
really big on this and I talk about this
5:27
a lot on my channel I feel like there's
5:29
a lot of people that will give you
5:30
advice on how to get from here to there
5:32
how to follow this strategy or how to
5:34
hustle or how to spend this money on ads
5:36
or how to do this and all that stuff is
5:38
great but if you skip the part where you
5:41
think about what you really want as an
5:43
individual and what you're trying to
5:45
achieve in your life you can often get
5:47
overwhelmed and turned around by what
5:50
other people are telling you to do and
5:52
it may not really be completely aligned
5:54
with what you want out of your life so
5:55
for example this is just a quick example
5:57
from my own life when I first started
6:00
writing and wanted to be a full-time
6:02
writer my husband was supporting me at
6:04
the time I had just quit my teaching job
6:05
and I was like okay I've got to start
6:07
making money how can I do that I wanted
6:09
to write young adult or I actually
6:12
started writing stories about
6:14
college-age students but then I joined a
6:16
local rwa group when I lived in Raleigh
6:18
and the first thing people told me was
6:20
you can't write about college students
6:22
this is before new adult kind of took
6:24
off in India and really before Indy was
6:26
a thing in digital publishing and they
6:28
were like you can't write for college
6:30
students nobody reads that stuff nobody
6:32
buys that stuff if you want to start
6:34
making money fast you should write for
6:35
Harlequin and you should write something
6:37
that pays well like the silhouette
6:39
desire line I don't
6:40
even if the silhouette desire line still
6:42
exists but I was like okay I went to a
6:45
used bookstore I bought a ton of
6:47
silhouette desire old copies for like a
6:50
dollar apiece I read a bunch of them I
6:52
sort of studied how they were and what
6:54
the plots were and then I wrote my own
6:56
and it took me a year to write it I
6:58
called it the millionaire's secret
6:59
merger and I submitted it to Harlequin
7:01
and that was the very first book I ever
7:03
finished I worked with a critique group
7:05
and all of that but it took me a year
7:06
and writing that book was like pulling
7:08
teeth I didn't enjoy it it wasn't what I
7:10
wanted to be writing I enjoyed reading
7:12
them actually but I just didn't enjoy
7:15
having this story that didn't have
7:17
witches or werewolves or anything and it
7:19
wasn't coming-of-age it was just these
7:21
two people coming together in a romance
7:23
and I know that that is a great Jean row
7:25
but it just wasn't for me but I wrote it
7:28
and I spent a whole year of my life and
7:30
then tried to sell it to somebody
7:31
because other people told me that this
7:35
is what I should be writing to make
7:36
money and instead of really thinking
7:38
about what I wanted in my life I
7:40
followed that journey of I'm gonna write
7:43
what they say because I want to make
7:44
money and I was desperate and I was
7:46
overwhelmed and I was just trying to do
7:48
the right thing to make money because
7:50
that's what I needed and I thought that
7:52
this would be the way to get me to my
7:54
dream of writing full-time but what I
7:56
ignored was the fact that it wasn't what
7:58
I wanted to be writing so I actually am
8:01
grateful that christus trover who was
8:04
the editor at Harlequin that year at
8:06
silhouette desire sent me a note and
8:08
rejected my story she was like I love
8:10
your writing style you've really got a
8:12
knack for this but there's too much
8:14
subplot in this and so you can either
8:16
rewrite it and resubmit or send us
8:19
something different and I have been
8:21
grateful ever since then that she
8:23
rejected that novel because if she had
8:25
taken that book and I had started
8:27
writing these silhouette desire novels
8:29
for Harlequin I would have been stuck
8:31
with the only way I was making money
8:33
writing something I did not enjoy
8:35
writing and I know I would have burned
8:38
out and I would have been unhappy and
8:39
maybe I wouldn't even be a writer today
8:41
because of it so what I want you to
8:43
understand first is that whatever it is
8:47
you want you have to think about it not
8:50
just what's the end result like oh you
8:53
want the big house
8:54
you want the full-time income or you
8:55
want to quit your job not just that but
8:57
how do you want to get there who do you
8:59
want to be on that path to that money or
9:03
to that career because whether you're a
9:05
writer or not if you have this goal that
9:08
you want to achieve but you get there
9:10
you try to get there by doing things you
9:12
don't enjoy or that don't feel like who
9:14
you are or by changing who you are
9:16
you're not going to be happy when you do
9:18
get there and you're probably not ever
9:20
actually going to get where you want to
9:21
go because you're not doing things that
9:23
are really aligned with who you are so
9:25
this is not a judgment in any way it's
9:28
just sharing my experience that as a
9:31
writer I jumped on what other people
9:33
told me I should write because I could
9:35
make money and there are actually I know
9:37
because people email me it talk to me
9:39
about this a lot there are a lot of
9:41
people who want to write young adult
9:43
fiction and don't because a lot of
9:45
people tell them you can't make money
9:47
writing why a well I can tell you that I
9:49
have been making six figures and a
9:50
full-time income in Y a4 I've been
9:53
making six figures for about seven years
9:55
but I've been making a full-time over
9:57
fifty thousand dollars a year writing Y
9:59
a for nine years and I have written some
10:02
new adult which is more like college age
10:04
but the majority of my work and the
10:06
majority of my sales have come from
10:08
young adult fiction in indeed writing
10:10
and I make six figures a year and it's
10:13
wonderful and it's what I love to write
10:14
it's what I want to be writing so don't
10:16
let anybody tell you you can't write why
10:19
and make money or you can't write Amish
10:21
romance and make money or you can't
10:23
write gay romance and make money you can
10:25
make money right now writing anything
10:27
but it's a matter of how you put your
10:29
strategy together because why a might be
10:32
a little more difficult than if you
10:33
followed like the trendiest werewolf
10:35
shifter or something like that
10:36
trends are always going to sell better
10:37
but it's a matter of finding a way to
10:42
write what you want to write and still
10:44
be successful rather than trying to
10:46
change who you are and what you love and
10:48
try to fit into a mold because I can
10:50
guarantee you that 99% of people who
10:53
write stuff they don't enjoy or didn't
10:54
want to write just to make money are not
10:56
going to be happy or successful long
10:58
term and if you are successful you're
11:01
going to maybe even resent the fact that
11:04
you can't leave this genre that you
11:06
don't love because
11:07
you're making too much money and now you
11:08
have to you have to write it and you're
11:10
trapped in that so just a thought
11:12
something to consider is really think
11:14
about what it is you want and then find
11:16
a way to make that happen rather than
11:18
trying to write or do something that you
11:21
don't want to do to try to get to the
11:23
end goal I hope that makes sense and I
11:25
hope you hear me
11:26
because I know there are people out
11:27
there that need to hear that message so
11:29
that they don't waste years of their
11:30
life like I did another factor in this
11:33
is in not feeling overwhelmed is this
11:37
feeling that you have to compete with
11:39
other people or that you have to beyond
11:42
this time limit in order to achieve your
11:45
goals something that really changed and
11:47
clicked for me was my business mentor
11:50
amber McHugh I talk about her all the
11:52
time I'm in a group of hers called
11:53
freshly implemented she talks about how
11:56
you are right on time you can't be late
11:58
for your destiny you are right where
12:00
you're supposed to be and stop feeling
12:02
like you're behind even when it feels
12:03
like things aren't going exactly the
12:05
right way you're gonna be able to look
12:07
back on it and go wow that worked out
12:09
just like it was supposed to you were
12:10
right on time and I love her for that
12:13
you guys should definitely check her out
12:14
she has an amazing podcast called the
12:16
modern CEO and I think you can find
12:18
pretty much all of her stuff at amber
12:20
McHugh comm but she is really somebody
12:24
in my life that keeps me grounded on
12:26
this idea I also worked with a taro life
12:29
coach named Tonya Gonzalez and she
12:31
helped me so much as well so getting
12:34
help and advice from people that you
12:36
trust and that you feel aligned with can
12:38
be super helpful and letting them
12:39
motivate you
12:40
not necessarily letting them direct your
12:42
life but letting them remind you that
12:44
you're not on a time limit you're not
12:46
competing with anyone else in this life
12:48
it's not like there's only 5,000 authors
12:51
who can make a living and if you're not
12:53
there yet you're gonna miss out forever
12:55
there's always room for more
12:56
they're always readers it's just a
12:58
matter of finding your path to that
13:01
career and that life that you want but
13:03
some of us are going to start late some
13:05
of us are going to take awhile to get
13:07
there and that's part of your journey
13:08
and you should honor that but if you
13:10
find yourself not going after your
13:12
dreams because you feel overwhelmed or
13:14
you feel like too many people are living
13:16
it and it scares you because you're
13:18
comparing yourself and you feel that
13:19
right now in your
13:20
getting things done then there are some
13:22
great steps that you can take first
13:24
being really thinking about what it is
13:27
you want in your life and the second
13:29
being figuring out a way to plan your
13:32
schedule and to really focus in on only
13:35
the things that matter because when we
13:38
start to feel overwhelmed it's usually
13:40
because we're trying to do way too much
13:42
with our time and I've talked about this
13:45
over and over and over again because I
13:46
have been there and I did waste years of
13:49
my life trying to do it all thinking
13:51
okay I've got to have the newsletter
13:52
I've got to have you know this other
13:54
thing going on I've got to be running
13:56
these Facebook ads and I need to be
13:57
doing this other thing and oh I should
13:59
be writing this type of book because
14:00
it's really trendy and so I was kind of
14:02
like this like you know people say
14:04
squirrel you know whatever it was kind
14:05
of this person who was looking from one
14:08
thing to the next and feeling like I had
14:09
to do it all right now I was gonna be
14:11
way behind and what that resulted in for
14:14
me was getting nothing done and it
14:16
wasn't until I started 90 day planning
14:18
and really focusing in on only three
14:21
goals per quarter and then having that
14:23
overarching goal of what I wanted to
14:25
achieve and breaking that down into
14:27
projects and tasks and knowing every
14:29
single 90 days that this is where I'm
14:31
focused so no matter what anybody else
14:33
says or what else I think like oh maybe
14:35
I should be doing that
14:36
okay then I'll revisit that and think if
14:38
I want to do it next quarter but it has
14:40
freed up my mind and my emotions to not
14:44
feel overwhelmed and to not feel like
14:46
I'm behind because I know that what I'm
14:48
working on this 90 days is not only
14:50
stuff that I have time for this quarter
14:52
but stuff that is going to move me
14:54
toward my ideal vision for my life and I
14:57
cannot express to you how incredibly
14:59
powerful and life-changing that has been
15:01
for me so if you are struggling with
15:04
feeling like you have just this huge
15:06
to-do list
15:07
and you just keep adding to it when
15:08
you're watching what other people are
15:09
doing or you start thinking about it and
15:11
you find that on any given day what
15:14
you're doing is just whatever demands
15:16
your attention at the time like maybe
15:17
you were gonna write 5,000 words but
15:19
this emergency email came in and then
15:21
somebody told you about this thing that
15:23
we're trying and now you want to go try
15:24
it and it's there's a new social media
15:26
site out so you feel like you need to go
15:27
do that and then somebody mentions that
15:29
your Instagram pictures could be better
15:31
so now you want to try
15:32
practicing your Instagram pictures and
15:34
you find that you get to the end of the
15:36
day and you didn't do what you intended
15:38
to do and in fact you didn't really get
15:39
anything accomplished you just kind of
15:41
did a bunch of random projects if you're
15:44
there then I highly encourage you to go
15:47
back and watch some of my Kanban Biddy
15:48
videos maybe even sign up for my HP 90
15:51
bootcamp that starts tomorrow or grab my
15:53
HP 90 planner from Etsy which I'll link
15:56
down below is still on sale 20% off
15:58
until Friday because what I can teach
16:01
you in that course or in that planner is
16:03
how to set those three goals how to
16:06
prioritize what you're doing and focus
16:08
in on only what you can get done this
16:11
quarter and be realistic about it then
16:13
every day when you sit down you can sort
16:16
of ignore those overwhelming things that
16:18
come up and you can say this is what I'm
16:20
doing I'm know I'm focusing on these
16:22
things only and there's a confidence
16:24
that comes with that of like okay yes
16:27
there's other things that I feel like I
16:29
need to do I'm gonna put that into a
16:30
future log that I can work on next
16:33
quarter but for now I know what I'm
16:35
doing and I know why I'm doing it and I
16:37
know where it's going to take me in my
16:38
life and there's something like so
16:40
confident and powerful it's like instead
16:42
of letting your schedule run you or your
16:44
to-do lists run your life you are in
16:47
control of your life and that has helped
16:50
me feel not only powerful but also
16:53
joyful because I've worked in time to
16:56
spend with my family I worked in time in
16:58
this quarter to get this packing done to
17:00
get the courses launched to work on my
17:02
planner so it looks like I'm getting so
17:04
much done but really I'm just very very
17:07
focused and I'm not doing anything that
17:09
isn't on my 90-day list and there is
17:12
nothing superhuman or super powerful
17:14
about me I don't have more time in my
17:16
day I'm not just a more disciplined
17:18
person than you are there's nothing I am
17:20
accomplishing that you can't accomplish
17:22
all it is is a matter of planning really
17:25
well and being super focused not only on
17:28
what I want but where I'm going and
17:30
exactly what I'm doing so that is how I
17:32
don't feel overwhelmed - despite all
17:34
that's going on we'll see how things go
17:36
when this baby girl comes along because
17:38
I know that's gonna throw my schedule
17:40
for a loop but I'm kind of excited for
17:42
the adventure and maybe doing some
17:43
videos on how to write and keep up with
17:46
your two
17:46
list in your schedule when you have a
17:48
newborn at home but for now I hope that
17:51
you have taken something from this video
17:53
and if you're feeling overwhelmed in
17:54
your life I hope that you take the time
17:56
to really think about what it is you
17:58
want and then come up with a plan for
18:00
yourself whether it's my HP 90 plan or
18:02
your own version of a plan that really
18:04
works for you because everybody kind of
18:06
learns and plans differently but come up
18:08
with a way to focus your time in so that
18:10
you only have a limited number of tasks
18:13
and you don't feel like you're taking on
18:14
the world because that can help so much
18:17
with your focus and your motivation and
18:19
your power in this life then make sure
18:21
that you're setting aside time for the
18:24
things that you enjoy and for self-care
18:26
because even despite all the work that's
18:28
gone into this move I have taken a lot
18:31
of time to take a bath every night to
18:33
spend time on the couch with my husband
18:35
and my son just enjoying us reading a
18:37
book to the baby or whatever else we've
18:39
been eating out a lot and enjoying our
18:41
time when we sit down as relaxing you
18:44
know eating out and that's something
18:45
we've been intentionally doing and we
18:47
saved money to be able to eat out almost
18:49
every day this week at least one meal to
18:51
enjoy our family time so taking time for
18:54
yourself focusing in on your schedule
18:56
and really taking the time to figure out
18:58
what you want those are probably
18:59
probably my three biggest tips for how
19:01
to get the life that you really want
19:03
without feeling so overwhelmed so this
19:06
video is a little bit longer than I
19:07
intended but I hope that you guys
19:09
understand that I'm speaking from my
19:11
heart and that I truly hope that you can
19:14
if you are struggling with feeling like
19:16
you're not getting enough done or
19:17
feeling like you're overwhelmed or
19:19
you're just not living up to your
19:20
potential that these tips will help you
19:22
feel inspired to go after that life you
19:24
want and of course I wanted to let you
19:26
guys know that my HP 90 bootcamp where I
19:30
talk and teach you how to do all of
19:32
these things is opening tomorrow and
19:34
then once it closes it won't open again
19:36
for three months and even then I'm not
19:39
100% sure I'll be opening it again in
19:40
the fall it just depends on how things
19:42
are going with the baby so three months
19:44
or six months it'll be opening again
19:46
if you want to get your schedule under
19:47
control and you want to go through and
19:49
this really resonated with you and
19:50
sparked something within you I would
19:52
love to have you join me the course
19:54
starts tomorrow night and runs through
19:55
this weekend but once you've bought the
19:57
course you can have
19:58
access to it and you can go through
19:59
every single quarter and you get access
20:02
to a Facebook group where you have
20:03
weekly support from me Facebook lives
20:06
every once in a while but always an
20:07
accountability post every Sunday
20:09
and you get a free version of my q3
20:11
planner so I would love to have you join
20:13
registration closes tomorrow night so
20:15
get in if you can if you would like to
20:18
or head over to Etsy and grab my q3
20:21
planner if you want to give the program
20:22
a try without the course but you can
20:24
find all those links down below then if
20:27
that part that I was talking about with
20:30
writing the Harlequin or writing what I
20:32
didn't love and you really resonated
20:34
with that and you want to learn how to
20:36
write what you want but come up with a
20:38
strategy that's going to help you be
20:40
successful and maybe even quit your
20:41
full-time job or you know find that life
20:44
that you want writing the kinds of books
20:45
that you love I also have a new course
20:48
that is launching in July called publish
20:50
and thrive where I'm gonna go through
20:51
exactly how I did that and it's not that
20:53
I spent twenty thousand dollars a month
20:55
on ads because I probably haven't spent
20:57
twenty thousand dollars on ads in nine
20:58
years it's because I put together
21:00
strategies and I communicated with my
21:03
fan in certain ways and I published in
21:05
certain ways that helped me to be more
21:06
successful so if you want to hear all
21:08
about my strategies and you want to
21:10
learn the ins and outs of
21:11
self-publishing from keywords to ISBNs
21:13
and all of that goodness then this is a
21:15
five week course called publish and
21:17
thrive it's the first time it's ever
21:18
being offered in this format and right
21:21
now you can either purchase that course
21:22
separately to start on July 8th or I
21:24
have this exclusive summer course bundle
21:27
where you get both HB 90 and the publish
21:31
and thrive course for $50 off so if you
21:33
want to check all that stuff out it is
21:35
down below in the description box but
21:37
regardless of whether you want to come
21:40
join any of my courses I do hope that
21:41
you got something out of this video and
21:43
I hope that you'll comment below and let
21:45
me know if any of these tips resonated
21:46
with you or if you've been struggling
21:48
with any of these things in your life
21:49
alright guys this is the last time you
21:52
will see this office in this setup
21:54
because this is the very last recording
21:56
I'll be doing here and next time you see
21:58

a question that i was asked so many
0:02
times last year
0:03
after i did my video series on how to
0:05
write a book series
0:07
was can you talk about the difference
0:09
between a series
0:10
and a serial but the truth is that is
0:13
not the right question
0:15
the real question is what's the
0:17
difference between
0:18
a novel and a cereal that's what we're
0:20
going to talk about today so
0:22
stay tuned
0:26
welcome back to heart breathings so as i
0:28
said in the intro
0:30
really when you think about cereals all
0:33
cereals to me are a series because a
0:36
cereal by
0:37
my definition is a story that unfolds
0:39
over multiple volumes
0:41
so you can't just have a cereal that is
0:43
one single episode you need at least
0:45
two or three episodes to get a cereal
0:47
going and i would say that most
0:49
cereals have four or more episodes i
0:52
wrote a serial called
0:53
sacrifice me it has six episodes inside
0:57
this first season and then i also wrote
0:59
a second season of this same series
1:01
that continues on and also has six
1:03
episodes so my serial total has
1:06
12 full episodes and that basically
1:09
would equate to two full novels or two
1:11
seasons so a cereal is a series
1:15
so when we ask what is a serial versus
1:17
what is a series
1:18
really what we should be asking is what
1:20
is a serial versus a novel
1:23
because as we talked about in my
1:24
previous video series last year
1:27
about how to plan and write a series
1:29
there are many different types of series
1:31
out there
1:32
a serial is just another type of series
1:35
but a regular series whether it be a
1:37
dynamic series or standalone series or
1:40
any of those types of series that i talk
1:41
about
1:42
is usually made up of novels a serial
1:45
however
1:46
is made up of a different type of
1:48
structure when i started
1:51
looking into this video and researching
1:53
for it i came to realize
1:55
that there are actually a lot of
1:56
differing opinions out there about what
1:58
a serial actually is
2:00
and in fact i couldn't find a single
2:02
like industry standard
2:04
definition and i found a lot of videos
2:06
on youtube that
2:08
say things about cereals that i don't
2:09
necessarily agree with
2:11
so i'll just put it out there that what
2:13
i'm gonna say about a cereal
2:14
comes from my own opinion and my own
2:16
experience
2:17
but there are other opinions out there
2:20
so
2:21
for example some people will just tell
2:23
you that a serial is
2:25
a novel broken into pieces
2:28
i personally don't fully agree with this
2:30
if you have
2:31
a novel that's already written that was
2:33
written to be a novel
2:35
you can't in my opinion usually just
2:38
divide that up into six pieces and throw
2:40
it onto
2:41
amazon as six different volumes of a
2:43
cereal a serial has
2:45
a slightly different structure to it and
2:48
different pacing
2:49
than a novel it is meant to be read in
2:52
installments in chapters in pieces so
2:56
the structure and the way that you ramp
2:58
up the conflict to make people want to
3:00
read the next part
3:01
is part of the structure of a serial a
3:04
novel however is meant to be read
3:06
as a full-length novel you're supposed
3:08
to read this whole thing all at once
3:10
whereas with the cereal while i can
3:12
package it together once it's completed
3:14
this originally was published in six
3:17
different installments and was meant to
3:19
be read with that kind of fast-paced
3:21
excitement
3:22
where you finish one episode and you
3:24
can't wait to get
3:26
to the next so i really don't feel
3:29
that a serial is just a novel broken
3:31
into pieces
3:32
some people will also say that a serial
3:35
is any story that doesn't stand alone
3:38
and
3:38
progresses over multiple volumes well
3:42
i also don't fully agree with that
3:44
because that would be saying that
3:46
basically
3:46
any series that is a dynamic series or
3:50
continuing series of any kind
3:52
is a serial but i personally would not
3:55
call
3:55
like the wheel of time for example a
3:58
cereal
3:59
those are complex 300 400 000 word
4:03
books in these large tomes i don't see
4:06
that every
4:08
book in that series is an episode of a
4:10
cereal
4:11
to me a cereal is something that is much
4:13
more short-serving
4:14
much more fast-paced and reads more like
4:17
a chapter or a section of a book
4:19
rather than a full-length novel so
4:22
this is where it comes into play that we
4:25
come up with a definition
4:26
of a serial that is really not what's
4:29
the difference between a series and a
4:31
serial
4:32
but what's the difference between a
4:34
series of novels like the wheel of time
4:37
or like my shadow demon saga
4:39
versus a cereal like stephen king's the
4:42
green mile
4:43
what makes that different from a series
4:45
of novels
4:46
so that leads us to me trying to come up
4:49
with a definition
4:50
which has been a little bit difficult i
4:52
am notoriously bad at definitions so i'm
4:54
going to take a stab at it and do
4:56
my best a serial is a complete story arc
4:59
told in multiple often fast-paced
5:02
installments that still can sound kind
5:05
of like my definition of a series
5:07
but hopefully you understand from my
5:09
earlier explanation
5:11
how it's different here's another way
5:13
that i can describe it without having to
5:15
give you a definition
5:17
but to put it into layman's terms so to
5:19
speak
5:20
in my mind when i think about it a novel
5:23
is like a movie so you have the story
5:26
question
5:27
almost all of your questions are
5:28
answered by the end of it you've got
5:30
kind of this one driving conflict and
5:33
all of this
5:33
complex like rising and falling action
5:36
you've got
5:37
three full acts a huge battle at the end
5:39
or
5:40
you know depending if it's an emotional
5:42
but basically a fight
5:43
to survive at the end in one way or
5:45
another be it emotional or psychological
5:48
or
5:48
actual physical death and then you have
5:51
some kind of resolution to whatever that
5:53
first
5:54
initial story problem was now with a
5:57
novel or
5:58
a movie series where you know there's
5:59
going to be multiple volumes
6:01
of this movie series like a trilogy so
6:04
we're thinking of things like the matrix
6:06
you could watch the matrix but of course
6:08
you have questions at the end of it
6:10
and you want to keep going that story
6:13
unfolds
6:14
yet each individual movie has its own
6:17
complete story arc
6:18
and character arc in each one so another
6:20
example of this type of
6:22
series would be the star wars series so
6:26
you've got nine
6:27
complete movies and yes
6:30
it progresses in terms of they share a
6:32
story world
6:34
and the storyline progresses from one
6:36
novel to the next and or one movie to
6:38
the next and you see the same recurring
6:39
characters
6:40
and it has a thread that holds it
6:43
together in this big umbrella but each
6:45
movie does
6:46
stand alone with some kind of
6:48
satisfactory conclusion to the main
6:50
story question there's rising falling
6:53
action it's an entire
6:54
thing in and of itself so that's the way
6:57
i think of
6:58
novels they're movies and sometimes
7:00
they're standalone movies
7:01
and sometimes they're movies that you
7:03
need to see multiple movies to get the
7:06
full character arc or to have all of
7:07
your questions answered
7:09
but a lot of your questions are answered
7:10
and there is some kind of resolution
7:12
in every single one whereas a serial is
7:16
more like a tv show a television show
7:19
that is told in multiple installments
7:21
would be something like
7:22
lost in lost you watch that first
7:25
episode
7:26
you don't have any resolution there is
7:28
nothing but questions after
7:30
that first episode and for some of us
7:32
there's nothing but questions after the
7:34
final episode too
7:35
but you may have rising action and
7:38
conflict and maybe you have a bit of
7:40
resolution to
7:42
some kind of relationship thing or you
7:44
get one answer is revealed to you
7:46
but usually in a television series
7:48
especially one like
7:50
lost or weeds or something where it's a
7:52
dynamic storytelling where it's
7:54
you have to watch them in order and
7:56
there's lots of cliffhangers and twists
7:58
and turns
7:59
you get more questions each episode than
8:02
you do
8:02
answers and it takes you an entire
8:04
season
8:05
of episodes sometimes that can be 10
8:07
sometimes that could be 26
8:09
to get the full story of what's really
8:12
happening in
8:13
this season another example would be
8:15
since i used the star wars
8:17
movies as movies compared to novels
8:20
look at the mandalorian so in the
8:22
mandalorian you have
8:23
multiple episodes before you really get
8:25
resolution to
8:27
the story's main event for this
8:30
particular season
8:32
so in this way it's just a different
8:34
type of storytelling
8:36
where in novels or movies you do maybe
8:39
still have a few questions that linger
8:41
on you may have these
8:42
overarching storylines but you do have a
8:44
self-contained complete storyline in
8:47
each movie or each novel in a series
8:49
a cereal it's not as self-contained it's
8:52
usually maybe just
8:54
a scene or two that may provide one
8:56
answer
8:57
while giving you five more questions and
9:00
there's always that feeling of
9:02
this is not resolved this is not
9:03
resolved and every time you finish
9:06
reading a serial you should have that
9:08
feeling of i've got to read the next one
9:10
that's part of the point of it
9:12
is to have that anticipation that
9:16
breathless anticipation this is part of
9:18
why
9:18
we watch tv shows and we enjoy those
9:21
like
9:22
cliffhangers and all of those things
9:24
well at least i do for sure
9:25
is because we want that depth of being
9:28
able to watch something
9:29
unfold over 13 episodes rather than just
9:33
one single sit down and have to watch it
9:35
all the way through
9:36
if you wanted to look at it that way you
9:38
could say that the mandalorian is like
9:40
one big movie
9:41
broken into you know episodes
9:44
one novel or one story broken into
9:47
pieces
9:47
but if you look at something like the
9:49
mandalorian you'll also notice that each
9:52
episode kind of has its own
9:53
task or quest and it is resolved but
9:57
each resolution
9:58
leads to another part of the story and
10:01
there's this overarching
10:02
storyline but you don't have two to two
10:05
and a half hours to explore each case
10:08
so each case is a little bit smaller
10:10
than each
10:11
big case in a movie so what you end up
10:14
with
10:14
is a novel or movie may have a full
10:17
complete three-act structure
10:19
and leave you with few questions but at
10:21
least some that maybe carry you through
10:23
to the next book
10:24
a serial or a tv show will not
10:27
usually have a complete complex
10:30
three-act structure
10:31
some cereals will actually have a
10:33
beginning middle
10:34
and a climax in resolution for each
10:37
episode of the serial
10:39
but it's not going to be as drawn out or
10:41
complex or detailed as
10:43
a novel in most cases now i will
10:46
say this there are in my mind or
10:49
experience of
10:50
reading two different kinds of cereals
10:52
the same way that we have multiple kinds
10:54
of series
10:55
so with a cereal you could have
10:57
something that is what i call a dynamic
10:59
series or dynamic cereal like my
11:01
sacrifice me season for example
11:04
you can't jump in in episode three and
11:06
understand what the heck is going on
11:08
you have to start from the beginning and
11:09
the same thing is true with a show
11:11
like lost that you have to start at the
11:14
beginning
11:15
then there are serials that are more
11:17
standalone or self-contained
11:19
so you can go on a spectrum there the
11:22
same way that you can
11:23
with novel series so you've got
11:26
standalone series that are things like
11:28
law and order
11:29
so there's things you learn about the
11:31
characters as you go you see the same
11:33
characters every time
11:34
but it is a self-contained case and you
11:36
could jump in on episode 562
11:39
of law and order and still basically get
11:41
the idea of what's happening each
11:43
episode does have a self-contained
11:45
case but it's not as complex
11:48
as an entire movie like the departed
11:52
so hopefully that gives you an idea so
11:54
in a serial if you decide
11:56
that you want to write one you can make
11:58
it where it's a continuing storyline or
12:01
a single case
12:02
or a single mystery or a single romance
12:05
that takes place over multiple volumes
12:07
and has a certain kind of structure
12:09
which we'll talk about in a minute
12:11
or it can be each one is self-contained
12:13
like law and order
12:15
or supernatural kind of has this sort of
12:17
feel to it where each one is sort of a
12:19
case but there are
12:20
really big overarching story lines that
12:23
do get woven
12:24
in throughout and sometimes sort of take
12:26
over the story
12:27
so hopefully that gives you a better
12:29
idea another way to explain that
12:32
is if a novel is a movie and a serial is
12:35
a tv show
12:36
then what part of what makes them
12:38
different like i just said
12:39
is complexity and length novels tend to
12:42
be more complex and they tend to be
12:44
longer with a full story structure
12:47
per novel cereals tend to be less
12:50
complex
12:51
in each episode now as you go through
12:54
the entire like six episodes it might
12:56
actually be
12:57
more complex than a single novel but
13:00
each individual episode is usually less
13:02
complex when it comes to the plot line
13:05
and it's usually shorter so when it
13:07
comes to length there is no industry
13:09
standard again
13:10
for an uh serial but most of the ones
13:13
that i have seen
13:14
have ranged anywhere from 5 000 words to
13:18
about 30
13:18
000 words a serial of novellas
13:22
is pretty common so my sacrifice me
13:24
series starts at 17 000 words and i
13:27
think it goes up to about 26 000 words
13:29
at the longest episode
13:31
you don't traditionally see cereals that
13:34
are 50
13:34
000 words per episode by the time you
13:37
get to
13:38
that long and complex of a storyline
13:40
you're looking at novels
13:42
not cereals so in my opinion
13:45
usually you're gonna see a cereal of
13:47
between five
13:48
and thirty thousand words another thing
13:50
that differentiates them
13:52
is the pacing so this is also a very
13:54
important distinction
13:56
because they are meant to be consumed as
13:58
a whole
14:00
you have a little bit more leeway and
14:02
expectation to have
14:04
parts that are fast-paced and parts that
14:06
are slower paced
14:08
so you can have a slower beginning a
14:10
slower intro
14:11
you can have more emotional reaction to
14:14
things that take longer or is more drawn
14:16
out you can not put as many twists and
14:18
turns in
14:19
as long as you hit those main turning
14:21
points like the act one climax the
14:23
second act climax
14:25
your black moment as long as you're
14:26
hitting those turning points you can
14:28
have a lot of rising and
14:30
falling action when it comes to your
14:31
pacing in your novel
14:33
a cereal is less forgiving when it comes
14:35
to pacing
14:36
a cereal for the most part needs to be
14:39
since it's shorter serving it needs to
14:41
be very
14:41
tightly written you don't have a lot of
14:44
time for
14:45
a lot of introspection in your
14:46
character's mind everything needs to be
14:49
feeding
14:49
into the conflict of the story and that
14:52
is what makes a truly
14:54
great cereal questions answers
14:56
investigations
14:57
emotional discovery all of that stuff is
15:00
still there in a novel of course
15:02
but in a cereal you're getting more of
15:04
it because it's just more concentrated
15:06
into a smaller
15:07
format so a 15 000 word piece
15:11
of your cereal can't be fifteen thousand
15:13
words of a conversation
15:15
or shouldn't probably be unless you can
15:17
make that conversation
15:18
really complex and interesting you need
15:21
action
15:22
and you don't have as much time to get
15:24
it in there so in my mind i'm just
15:26
going to draw this out put it up here on
15:27
the screen because i don't i couldn't
15:29
find a better graphic of this
15:31
but in my mind you have a novel
15:35
which can start at a conflict tense
15:37
point or a lower point you have some
15:39
story
15:40
development here and then you'll have a
15:42
turning point with rising action and
15:44
then you'll have a reaction to
15:46
that action and you'll have things that
15:48
happen conversations that happen
15:50
and then you'll have another moment of
15:51
rising action and the entire novel will
15:53
go that way lots of rising and falling
15:55
action
15:56
in a serial however the very first
15:59
episode
16:00
you are usually introducing the world so
16:02
you've got maybe a little bit slower
16:04
paced right there at the beginning
16:05
you're introducing the characters you're
16:07
introducing the world so you're gonna
16:08
have some
16:09
exposition in the first episode but then
16:12
you're usually going to have a hook
16:14
right from the beginning grab them right
16:16
from the start
16:17
where it's like that promise of the
16:18
premise appears a little bit earlier in
16:21
a cereal
16:22
for the most part and you're going to
16:24
see rising action
16:26
throughout almost the entire cereal
16:29
or episode and you'll see a little bit
16:32
of a dip with a reaction
16:34
and then constant rising and maybe a
16:35
little bit of a dip with an emotional
16:37
conversation
16:38
or introspection but for the most part
16:41
each
16:42
entire episode of your cereal is going
16:44
to have that rising action
16:46
and then you're going to have some kind
16:47
of climax it could be an
16:49
answer it could be a battle it could be
16:50
a confrontation or a new information
16:53
comes to light
16:54
and then you're going to have a moment
16:56
of what feels like slight resolution
16:58
and then boom it's going to hit you with
17:01
another twist or another piece of
17:02
information that is immediately going to
17:04
make you go
17:05
where is the next episode of this cereal
17:08
i need it immediately and really great
17:10
tv shows do
17:11
this the same way and it could be
17:13
anything from grey's anatomy
17:14
to lost to weeds to any genre that you
17:18
look at
17:18
doesn't have to be paranormal or big
17:20
action but it's just that feeling of
17:22
like you've got a little bit of
17:24
introduction at the beginning
17:26
maybe a slower pace at the beginning but
17:28
the action is pretty much
17:29
always rising the conflict is always
17:31
rising up to that ending point
17:33
you don't have as many peaks and valleys
17:36
in each episode of your cereal
17:38
it's always driving you to whatever that
17:40
ending moment is for this particular
17:43
episode of the cereal this is why i say
17:46
that you can't just take any old novel
17:48
and break it into pieces because in my
17:50
mind
17:51
each episode needs to have that rising
17:53
action whereas if you just
17:55
chunk out 15 000 words of a novel you
17:58
might have nothing but low
17:59
valley points with no climaxes nothing
18:02
that really makes people want to read
18:04
the next thing
18:05
so i feel like for that reason the third
18:07
thing
18:08
not just pacing but the structure of a
18:11
serial is different
18:12
than the structure of a novel okay so
18:14
i'm actually coming back
18:16
after i was working on my edits and i
18:18
just deleted about 12 minutes of me
18:20
talking about structure because i don't
18:22
think i did a good enough job explaining
18:24
it
18:24
so i'm going to take another crack at it
18:26
here and say
18:28
that i feel like for me in my personal
18:31
experience the way it made the most
18:32
sense to structure
18:34
my cereal is i had six episodes to work
18:38
with
18:38
the entire set of six episodes needed to
18:42
have its own
18:43
three act structure but because it was
18:45
separated into six
18:46
pieces instead of four or three if you
18:49
want to look at exact three act i had to
18:52
manipulate a little bit
18:53
so the end of act one is usually that
18:56
into the new world moment but because of
18:59
the premise and
19:00
the short-serving novella type style i
19:04
was following with the cereal
19:06
i wanted to hit that act one climax in
19:09
the very first episode at the very end
19:11
so
19:11
the act one climax in a normal 120 000
19:15
word novel
19:16
structurally should come around 25
19:19
or around 30 000 words into the book
19:22
however for me that would have put me
19:24
halfway through the second episode
19:26
and it wouldn't have made sense to have
19:28
episode one end
19:29
and then keep moving into the act one
19:31
climax and then still have stuff after
19:33
it
19:34
the act one climax was a perfect place
19:36
to throw a cliffhanger
19:38
into the story so what i had happened
19:41
instead was
19:42
manipulated the percentages of my novel
19:45
and i said okay since i'm writing a
19:47
serial i'm going to put that
19:49
into the new world moment right there in
19:51
the very first
19:53
episode so it happens more like 10
19:56
percent of the overall
19:57
cereal so in that way i feel like you
20:00
may still have
20:01
over the course of your entire cereal a
20:05
loose three-act structure where you have
20:08
a
20:08
act one climax you still have a
20:10
mid-point
20:11
for me since i had six episodes my
20:14
midpoint did happen at the end of
20:16
episode three and it was one of the
20:17
biggest twists but instead of having a
20:19
falling off point after that
20:21
where you have like a recalibration i
20:24
just threw
20:25
more twists in because you're constantly
20:27
ratcheting up that tension and conflict
20:29
in the cereal
20:30
in a way you might not always feel is
20:33
necessary in a novel
20:34
so i kept some of the loose three-act
20:37
structure
20:38
as a sort of umbrella for the entire
20:40
cereal
20:41
but each individual percentage
20:44
didn't fall exactly in the traditional
20:47
place for a novel you have to sometimes
20:49
be willing to manipulate the story
20:50
structure
20:51
instead of writing a novel and then
20:53
chunking it down you're making sure that
20:55
you're pulling your readers along that
20:57
they're going to be turning pages and
20:59
they're hitting the good structural
21:01
points that they need to hit in each
21:03
episode
21:03
in addition to that overarching
21:06
structure of the season of my cereal
21:09
i also had a micro structure so
21:12
every individual episode had its own
21:15
beginning middle and end it had a
21:18
question
21:19
at the beginning like how will frankie
21:21
handle this or
21:22
what is rind going to do after this
21:24
thing so it's a recalibration moment
21:27
followed by new questions rising
21:29
conflict
21:30
fast pacing investigation whatever needs
21:32
to happen in that episode but there is
21:34
kind of a single question
21:36
and it has that sort of micro structure
21:38
so that each episode felt like it did
21:40
have a resolution
21:42
but unlike a novel where it feels like
21:43
the resolution to the whole main story
21:46
question it was just a resolution to one
21:48
small problem
21:49
of that episode so in that way it's kind
21:52
of
21:52
is like you're you're breaking a novel
21:55
into pieces
21:56
but each piece of the story needs to
21:59
have
21:59
its own structure whereas in a novel you
22:02
don't have that exact same
22:04
micro structure to your book and to me
22:06
this is one of the main differences
22:08
between writing a novel or a series of
22:11
novels
22:12
and writing a serial which is a series
22:14
of episodes
22:16
another difference in the plot structure
22:18
as i mentioned before
22:19
is that typically in a novel you're
22:21
going to have by the end of
22:23
each novel that story question and most
22:26
of the
22:26
issues that were going on in that novel
22:28
are going to be resolved in some manner
22:31
so think of it this way we're going back
22:33
to that movie
22:34
tv because i really think that examples
22:36
can be so valuable
22:38
you have the difference between say
22:40
buffy the vampire slayer
22:42
the movie so you have the story of how
22:44
she becomes a slayer and her
22:46
finally embracing her life as a slayer
22:49
it happens all
22:50
in one movie so it's paced very
22:52
differently than buffy the vampire
22:54
slayer
22:54
the series where she you know has
22:58
entire seasons of coming into her own
23:00
and character arc and
23:02
each one is an individual case whereas
23:04
in
23:05
the movie it's basically just this one
23:07
situation where she's fighting this one
23:09
guy and like trying not to become
23:11
his and she wants to be a slayer instead
23:14
but when you come to season one of buffy
23:16
that sort of storyline of will she
23:18
become his or will she stand on her own
23:20
and become the slayer
23:21
is spread over the course of multiple
23:24
episodes
23:25
and each episode has its own point or
23:28
its own case or its own mystery to solve
23:30
but there's also this stretched out
23:32
overarching storyline
23:33
and overall you get a lot more depth of
23:36
the story this way
23:37
but each individual episode is not as
23:40
complex or have as many rise
23:42
and fall moments as the movie another
23:44
example
23:45
would be if you have like a police
23:48
procedural
23:49
movie where you're trying to figure out
23:50
who done it or you're trying to
23:52
uh get the bad guy so you've got
23:54
something like seven
23:56
or uh the usual suspects or the girl on
23:59
the train
24:00
not police procedural but some kind of
24:02
mystery like that for a movie
24:03
you've got the entire who done it you
24:06
know by the end who did it you have that
24:08
resolution whereas when it comes to a
24:10
serial or a tv series you have something
24:12
like broadchurch
24:13
where there's a single pace stretched
24:15
out over the course of the entire season
24:17
and you get answers along the way
24:19
but each episode brings you more
24:22
questions oh my gosh maybe it's him
24:23
maybe it's her maybe it's this i need to
24:25
know more
24:26
and you don't find out the ultimate
24:28
whodunit until the
24:29
end of the 10 or however many episodes
24:32
there were in broad church season one
24:34
so it's that idea of you've got a
24:36
complete story here
24:38
maybe with a few unanswered questions
24:40
that is a novel
24:41
and when a novel is a series then you've
24:44
got an
24:44
umbrella of sorts go back and watch my
24:47
series on how to write a series and
24:48
you'll get that idea
24:50
versus a serial where you have a
24:52
complete story that's
24:53
told over multiple installments at a
24:56
faster pace
24:57
and with a continuing driving
25:00
conflict that really leaves you with a
25:03
lot of questions after each episode
25:06
and the answers to the questions don't
25:08
come fully
25:09
until the end so hopefully this gives
25:11
you a really good idea of what the
25:12
difference is between
25:14
a series and a serial now if you would
25:16
like to hear more about
25:18
the idea of publishing a serial what my
25:21
experience was i do talk a little bit
25:23
about it on today's blog post if you
25:25
want to head over to that the link is in
25:26
the description box down below
25:28
i also would be happy to do more videos
25:31
on this because i love
25:32
the idea of cereals and i'm planning
25:34
another serial coming up not this year
25:37
but maybe next year
25:38
and i would love to talk more about my
25:39
personal experience and what i've seen
25:41
in the industry in terms of what works
25:44
when it comes to marketing and
25:45
publishing cereals
25:46
how long they should be for each genre
25:48
which genres work
25:49
better with cereals as well as what you
25:51
should price your cereals at
25:53
so if you're interested in hearing more
25:55
about that sort of serial publishing
25:58
strategy
25:58
please let me know also if you are an
26:01
indie author
26:02
or an aspiring author who is looking to
26:05
self-publish start your own publishing
26:07
company self-publish your books and get
26:08
them
26:09

27:50
you
hey guys welcome back to heart
0:01
breathing's today we are going to move
0:03
on to tip number four I have been
0:05
sharing my 8 top tips and lessons
0:08
learned from eight years in indie
0:10
publishing if you're not familiar with
0:11
my channel I am author Sara cannon
0:14
I started indie publishing which means I
0:16
started self-publishing my own books I
0:18
started my own publishing company called
0:20
Dead River books and publishing my own
0:22
books back in October of 2010 and since
0:25
then I have sold nearly three-quarters
0:27
of a million books and Counting and so
0:30
I'm gonna share my eight top tips for
0:32
you on not necessarily how I sold those
0:35
books but eight lessons that I've
0:36
learned and tips that I have for how to
0:38
live a joyful life as a self-published
0:40
author so today we are talking about tip
0:43
number four which is success takes time
0:50
so this is semi adjacent to the previous
Dont Compare
0:54
video where I talked about how I really
0:57
argue to think long term because every
1:00
choice you make does affect you over the
1:02
course of potentially the next years or
1:05
your entire career so it's good to think
1:07
long term but this is a little bit
1:09
different because I think that right now
1:12
with social media and everything being
1:13
so immediate and you can immediately see
1:15
how other people are doing and you know
1:18
you've got Facebook groups if you're an
1:19
author and you're paying attention to
1:21
what other people are doing where people
1:23
will just come on and say oh this is my
1:26
first book ever and I just made $5,000
1:29
this month and you could be sitting
1:30
there going oh my god I've been writing
1:32
and publishing for two years and I've
1:35
never made $5,000 a month course this
1:37
also goes back to tip number one of you
1:39
know don't compare yourself to others
1:40
because comparison kills joy but also a
1:43
lot of times after watching and you know
1:46
struggling with comparison watching
1:48
people like that that come out of the
1:49
woodwork and they suddenly say they're
1:51
making all this money is that there's
1:53
two things that often are true number
1:55
one a lot of times that success is not
1:58
real success because they actually spent
2:00
more money than they made and they are
2:02
it's kind of smoking mirrors and number
2:05
two it often happens that you know
2:08
somebody has that big success because of
2:10
some big launch strategy that they were
2:12
out they had you know a bunch of friends
2:14
help them get to the top they spent a
2:16
lot of money or they did this big like
2:18
thing or they were big on a fan fiction
2:20
site or there's usually some reason
2:22
very few people just come to the you
2:24
know very first book and hit it out of
2:26
the park it does happen you know when
2:29
you just hit the right note or you hit
2:31
the trend just right or you know just
2:33
luck
2:34
who knows but it does happen to people
2:37
that they just you know are overnight
2:39
sensations but for the most part when
2:41
you see people coming out of the
2:42
woodwork saying that they have their
2:44
first month and they just made all this
2:45
money they were usually following some
2:47
kind of short-term tactic that you know
2:50
six months from now that book is in the
2:53
basement of the millions in the Kindle
2:55
Store and you know it wasn't really a
2:57
great long-term strategy so don't
Success Takes Time
3:00
compare yourself to other people going
3:02
back to tip number one but what I want
3:04
you to understand is that you know that
3:06
sort of overnight success whether it's a
3:08
flash in the pan kind of moment or
3:10
whether it's something that you know
3:12
like I have a good friend who came kind
3:15
of out of nowhere and she hit it really
3:17
hard she had some really good strategies
3:19
we strategize together
3:21
she took my self-publishing course and
3:22
she hit the USA Today bestseller list
3:25
several months after she first started
3:27
and she still hits the USA Today
3:29
bestseller list with every book she
3:31
writes she works hard for it she writes
3:33
really great books and she's just
3:35
followed really consistent solid
3:36
strategies some of it was probably luck
3:39
but that is a very unusual trajectory
3:42
for an indie career and what I want you
3:45
to understand is that success for the
3:47
majority of people 99.9% of us takes
3:51
time it takes time to build up your
3:54
strategy it takes time to build up your
3:55
readership it takes time to find your
3:58
true voice and the types of books that
4:00
you really want to be writing it takes
4:02
time to find your audience you know all
4:04
of these things take time so be patient
4:06
with yourself it feels like often when
4:10
we're watching what other people are
4:11
doing that like everybody's finding
4:13
success really fast and there's all
4:15
these people talking about how much
4:16
money they're making but the truth is
4:18
that you know those of us that are
4:20
consistently making six figures and
4:22
we're doing it year after year after
4:24
year it took us years
Years of Hard Work
4:26
of hard work not only I mean I was
4:28
writing full-time basically for three
4:30
years before I ever made a dime so that
4:32
was like a lot of build up a lot of
4:34
craft work a lot of working on my voice
4:36
a lot of trying to figure out exactly
4:37
what I wanted to write that was time
4:39
invested without money and then it took
4:42
me to my fourth year of indie publishing
4:44
before I made six figures so you know it
4:47
wasn't like an overnight sensation it
4:50
takes time to build and even that coming
4:53
you know coming into this career and
4:54
making six figures within the first four
4:56
years is really huge and I got very
4:58
lucky and I followed some solid
5:00
strategies but don't feel like you're a
5:04
failure if you've been at this for a
5:06
while and you are not finding huge
5:09
levels of success sometimes it just
5:11
takes time to build success is one of
5:15
those things like when you're looking at
5:16
your long-term vision of your life it's
Its a Journey
5:19
gonna be a journey from here to there to
5:21
get where you want to go it's much more
5:23
productive to pay attention to the
5:26
things that you can celebrate along the
5:28
way like oh my gosh I sold my first 50
5:31
books or I actually finished my first
5:33
book like wow how many of you out there
5:35
and you can comment down below you know
5:38
are still struggling to finish that
5:40
first book must much less think about
5:42
making six figures it takes time to
5:44
learn how to write a book it takes time
5:46
to understand the genre that you're
5:48
writing to really get you know the story
5:51
that you feel like is good enough to
5:53
push yourself past all that self-doubt
5:55
and actually finish your novel much less
5:58
to figure out how in the world you're
5:59
gonna edit it and get it all done then
6:02
you got to start thinking about your
6:03
strategy and how you know what series
6:05
you want to write or what whether you
6:06
want to write stand-alones and how
6:08
you're gonna market that there's so much
6:10
that goes into this business and we are
6:11
going to talk about that again in
6:12
another tip but don't put that pressure
6:15
like added pressure on yourself
6:17
to just suddenly make a ton of money or
6:20
you know build up a Facebook group of
6:23
five thousand fans overnight it really
6:25
is not a race nobody is looking at you
6:27
and going well you're completely
6:29
worthless if you didn't hit this number
6:31
of sales or this number of you know
6:34
Facebook followers in your first year
6:36
there is no such thing as that it takes
6:39
what it takes you are on your own
6:41
individual journey and you are going to
6:45
be served so much better by celebrating
6:49
every success along the way every 50
6:51
books whatever feels like success to you
6:53
finishing that book finally getting your
6:56
cover really finally getting you know
6:58
that first book launched selling ten
7:00
copies making your first $100 celebrate
7:04
everything along the way instead of
7:05
letting that pressure of like wanting
7:08
immediate success hold you back or make
7:11
you feel like you're not a success it
7:13
can take years and years and years to be
7:16
successful at the level that you dream
7:19
of like wildest dreams and it doesn't
7:22
mean that you're not good or that you're
7:24
not worthy or that you're not talented
7:25
sometimes there's a bit of luck involved
7:27
sometimes there's you know a lot of
7:29
strategy and like I've talked about in
7:31
previous videos you may have started
7:33
down the wrong path like I did writing
7:35
five series at once and it's going to
7:38
take years to you know kind of rectify
7:41
that situation and dig myself out as I
7:43
finished these series up so that I can
7:46
start something new with the fresh
7:47
strategy it just takes time so please be
7:51
patient with yourself please don't look
7:53
around to what other people are doing
7:54
and allow it to make you feel like
7:56
you're not moving fast enough like
7:58
you're not doing good enough before
8:00
self-publishing in digital age like
8:03
indie publishing the way it is now where
8:05
you can digitally get your ebooks onto
8:07
someone's eReader and before that
It Takes Time
8:09
revolution started taking place it
8:12
sometimes took authors a decade just to
8:15
get an agent and it still does for the
8:17
people that are searching and seeking
8:19
traditional publishing those people know
8:22
that it takes time they know that you
8:24
know those stories about somebody who
8:27
wrote a book over summer vacation and
8:30
sold it immediately for six-figure deal
8:31
that's like one in a million some kind
8:33
of look like rained down on someone's
8:36
life and it just doesn't happen for most
8:39
people so because you're not the one in
8:41
a million does not mean that you're not
8:43
good enough it doesn't mean that you're
8:44
never going to find success don't put
8:46
the pressure on yourself of having to
8:49
find success really
8:50
asked because it just takes time be
8:53
patient with yourself give yourself the
8:55
time that you need to develop your voice
8:58
and to really find the you know the
9:01
truth of what it is you want your life
9:04
to look like long term and celebrate
Stick With It
9:06
every little milestone along the way
9:08
because it is a journey and you may not
9:12
hit the level of success you want in the
9:14
first year or two but if you stick with
9:16
it you are going to find the level of
9:19
success that you want I know that you
9:22
can do it you just have to give yourself
9:24
the time to get it done and the more
9:27
time you waste along the way being angry
9:29
with yourself judging yourself being
9:31
frustrated that it's not going faster
9:33
then the less time you have to really
9:35
enjoy all the blessings that you have
9:37
right now like those fifty sales or the
9:39
fact that you're writing a book you
9:41
really love for the first time or that
9:42
you finally understand what you know
9:45
what pacing feels like or how to
9:46
structure a mystery all of those types
9:49
of things are really and truly wins
9:51
along the way there are so many
9:53
thousands probably hundreds of thousands
9:56
of people out there that have said for
9:58
their whole life oh I'm gonna write a
10:00
book I want to write a book I always
10:02
wanted to write a book I hear that all
10:04
the time but how many of them are
10:07
actually doing it how many of them are
10:09
taking the risk of saying I'm actually
10:11
going to dedicate myself to getting this
10:13
book out of my brain and learning how to
10:15
put it on paper and how many of them are
Be Patient
10:18
pushing past that initial realization
10:21
that wow this is a lot harder than I
10:22
thought it was gonna be their story
10:24
structure there's pacing there's
10:26
characterization there's all these
10:27
things that go into craft that I didn't
10:29
know how many people push past those
10:31
doubts and continue on to finish a novel
10:34
how many people then actually finish it
10:37
and move on to the editing stage if you
10:39
are in any of those categories besides
10:42
the person sitting on the couch watching
10:44
Netflix who says someday I'm going to
10:46
write a novel and has never taken the
10:48
first step then you're a winner because
10:50
you're showing up and you're following
10:52
those dreams so what I urge you to do is
10:55
be patient with yourself and say you
10:57
know what I am doing a great job I'm
11:00
gonna push myself I'm gonna be the best
11:02
that I can be I'm gonna give it a
11:03
hundred
11:04
but I am NOT going to put some kind of
11:07
time limit on my success because there
11:09
you know that again we talked about lies
11:12
when it comes to comparison that is
11:13
another way that your brain lies to you
11:16
there is no time limit on your success
11:19
my business mentor amber McHugh she
11:21
likes to say you are right on time and
11:24
it always makes me feel so much better
11:26
because when I get into my brain and I
11:29
start thinking gosh I'm so far behind
11:31
where I thought I would be in eight
11:32
years or gosh you know my income is less
11:34
than it was last year and you know I'm
11:36
running out of time and I'm 40 and bla
11:40
bla bla bla bla like when I get into
11:41
that loop it starts to depress me and
11:44
then I don't feel motivated to write I
11:46
don't feel happy I don't feel grateful
11:48
for the things I have but when I step
11:50
back and I say I'm right on time I am
11:53
exactly where I was meant to be and I am
11:56
grateful for every lesson that I have
11:58
learned along the way because I know
12:00
that I'm gonna be able to carry those
12:01
lessons even the mistakes even the
12:03
things that I've done wrong I'm gonna be
12:05
able to carry those into the future and
12:07
make better choices for myself and that
12:08
is gonna make all the difference I know
12:10
it in my heart when I step back and I
12:13
say be patient celebrate every step oh
12:16
my gosh look at this next new book that
12:18
got out I'm one step closer to finishing
12:20
these series when I you know really
12:23
focus on the things that are
12:25
accomplishments in my life that are
12:27
getting me closer to that ideal vision
12:29
of my future I celebrate it instead of
12:32
feeling like I'm still way behind or I'm
12:35
you know putting any kind of negative
12:37
emotion on that success takes time so be
12:42
patient with yourself because wherever
12:44
you are in the process in the journey
12:46
right now there are things to be learned
12:48
and there are things to be appreciated
12:50
and there's so so much to be grateful
12:52
for so if you find yourself in a
12:55
negative thought mindset where you're
12:58
feeling like you're running out of time
12:59
you're way behind you haven't finished
13:01
this book you've been working on you
13:03
know I want you to commit to finishing
13:06
it to commit to working toward that next
13:09
step wherever you are but I also want
13:11
you to tell yourself I am right on time
13:14
I am exactly where I'm meant to be and I
13:17
making my dreams come true focus on
13:19
gratitude and the things you have be
13:22
patient and understand that you know it
13:25
just is a journey and it's gonna take
13:27
you time but you are gonna get there

there is no doubt that social media can be such a powerful way to connect with
0:05
our ideal audience and to create a community online but so often I think
0:11
most of us sit around thinking what in the world do I even post to social media
0:16
and it can sometimes seem like everyone else has it figured out and then when we go to post ideas are not there we just
0:23
come up with a complete blank what does anyone want to hear from me what do my readers really want to see how do I get
0:29
a plan in place that helps me brainstorm social media ideas so I'm not constantly just throwing spaghetti at the wall so
0:36
if this is you and you want to be successful on social media but you have trouble brainstorming the right kinds of
0:42
ideas or knowing what to post then I have a great video for you today because I'm going to give you a very clear and
0:49
simple method to brainstorm tons of social media content in a small amount of time so let's get
0:56
[Music] started
1:01
I'm so excited for today because I have created for you a template that will help you just take a look at the
1:08
different topics and plug in your own ideas it's basically a brainstorming tool and I'm giving it to you for free
1:14
so you can either watch what I'm doing today and recreate it on your own or you can grab my free template that will give
1:20
you some extra ideas and will already all be set up for you when you sign up for my newsletter the link is down in
1:26
the description or if you're already on my heart breathings newslet letter list it is now in your inbox CU I sent it to
1:33
you an email today and it's in the heart breathings resource Library so let me talk you through how to make the
1:39
decisions to start filling out this very powerful social media brainstorming tool
Content Pillars
1:44
okay so to use this awesome brainstorming tool that I'm going to give you today there are a couple of decisions that we need to make first and
1:51
the first one is deciding on your content pillars so content pillars
1:56
they're sometimes called content buckets these are basically just topics that your ideal audience is interested in
2:03
seeing from you and I know that it sounds like oh my gosh what if they're not interested in seeing anything from me but I promise you that you have a
2:10
unique voice and you have things that your ideal readers or your ideal audience really wants to connect with so
2:17
how do we decide these content buckets the first thing that I encourage you to do is if you have your own following
2:25
already and you've already been posting to social media go and use your previous data even if you only have 50 followers
2:31
or something like that you still have posts that have 1 2 10 15 likes or more
2:37
so go back through your last 30 days of post or your last three months of posts and see which posts have gotten the most
2:45
engagement the most comments the most shares the most likes maybe it's every single time I post about how happy I am
2:52
and how much I love writing everyone comments or every single time I post about what books I'm reading people
2:58
comment pay attention to that and write it down because that might be one of your best potential content pillars or
3:04
buckets if you don't have a lot of data from your own social media or you're brand new to social media or you're just
3:10
looking for other ideas another great way to figure out popular content pillars is to actually figure out who
3:18
your comp authors are now we talk about your ideal reader Avatar and your comp
3:23
authors in detail in my publish and Thrive course so if you're interested in that it will be running again in
3:28
February so make sure on my list to get those details but basically your comp
3:33
authors are a group of authors who you would compare yourself to you would like to emulate their career or you know
3:40
you're writing books in a similar Niche or a similar genre you like their Vibe you like their style and you feel like
3:47
the readers who love their books would absolutely love your books so it's that crossover of like I know people who love
3:54
Pretty Little Liars and The Vampire Diaries and Twilight are going to love my Shadow Demon Saga and so think about
4:01
what other authors are writing books similar to yours or that will appeal to a similar audience make a list of five
4:07
to 10 of those authors and then go through their social media posts with a fine tooth comb what are the ones that
4:15
are getting the most views the most content the most comments the most likes
4:20
what are the ones that are just blowing up on social media or people are most interested in seeing take advice from
4:27
that and then take the data from that and then start to figure out what are
4:33
these content buckets what are these topic categories that consistently get good results and then start
4:39
experimenting with that in your own content also as you begin to think about these content buckets or umbrellas or
4:47
pillars or however you want to think about it these topics that you're going to talk about I want you to really think
4:52
about your ideal reader your ideal customer the ideal audience that's going
4:57
to be following you your ideal community who is that ideal person and the more that you can actually imagine them like
5:04
give them a name talk about where they live and what they care about what they like what type of books they read what
5:09
type of movies they watch and you can get really detailed about who they are the easier it's going to be to figure
5:14
out okay would Sally like this type of content for me and you are sort of playing a guessing game but it also will
5:21
help direct your focus so think about what does that person like what do they dislike what catches their attention
5:28
what reson Ates with them what do they care about what do they want to see from their favorite authors and see if that
5:35
helps you brainstorm some topics just as a few examples of content pillars I'm
Example Content Pillars
5:40
going to put them up on the screen for you here so one would be my why this is
5:45
why did I start writing in the first place why do I love this particular genre why am I so in love with the
5:52
process of writing but basically just talking about yourself and how you became an author and why you're doing
5:57
this why you're writing books another one might be your actual books and for most authors this probably
6:03
should be one of your content pillars so this is your current books that you're writing your work in progress It's also
6:09
your backlist books could be inspiration so you might be trying to inspire your
6:15
readers in some way this could tie back to the themes and values of your book it could be behind the scenes or your
6:21
writing process out at a coffee shop what kind of keyboard do you use how do you plot your books or do you pants them
6:28
could be Community which is one of my pillars how do I get people to engage with each other and feel like they're
6:33
part of something greater it could be something genre specific so for example I write witchy books so I might put in
6:39
my content pillars things like crystals or Moon rituals or tarot readings something like that if you're an
6:45
adventure author you might talk about hiking or being in the Grand Canyon or other Adventures that people might take
6:51
in real life if you're writing police procedurals you might discuss different laws or different true crime or other
6:57
things that are genre specific you also might use book recommendations and reviews now I put a caveat here that
7:04
most of the time when you're giving reviews of other people's work you want to make sure that you're only including books that you really enjoyed because
7:11
you don't want to be an author who trashes a fellow author so try to always keep it positive and give readers
7:17
examples of other books that you're reading that you think they're also going to enjoy you might also want to cover
7:23
writing advice so this writing advice is usually going to appeal more to writers than it will to readers but you will see
7:30
a lot of authors giving writing advice because a lot of readers want to be
7:36
writers or they already are writers and of course writers are readers as well so these are just a few examples of the
7:42
types of content pillars that you might want to use and I have all of these examples listed for you in the spreadsheet that I'm going to give you
7:48
today this is the first decision that you're going to need to make to fill out this brainstorming tool what are your
7:54
three to five content pillars or topics or buckets that you want to discuss
8:01
regularly on your social media okay the second part of this so helpful strategy
Visual Topics
8:08
for brainstorming your content is not just the content pillars which is what
8:14
you say this is your caption or the text that goes into your caption or what
8:19
you're saying you also have on social media these days almost always a visual
8:25
component so you'll have a photo and then that photo has a caption your caption is your content pillar but your
8:32
photo is a separate category this is known as your visual topics I was
8:38
introduced to this concept of separating out your content pillars your caption
8:44
and the text that you're putting on social media like the post itself with the visuals the video the images and
8:51
what people are actually seeing with their eyes so you've got reading and then you have the visual and I had never
8:57
thought about separating the two and using them as brainstorming tools until I took a webinar from Jasmine star who
9:04
is incredible I will link her YouTube channel and her social media down below for you she also has a membership called
9:10
social curator which I'm a part of but this idea of having visual topics that
9:15
are separate from your content pillars was just mind-blowing for me because this is often really the way that social
9:23
media works is we may have a photo of our coffee mug but in the caption we're
9:28
not saying wow isn't this such a cute coffee mug that doesn't really engage readers but if I said oh my gosh I can't
9:35
live without my favorite morning coffee and you know what I love to do when I'm grabbing my coffee I love to sit down
9:41
and read and the books that I've been reading lately are such and such or who here loves to drink coffee just as much
9:48
as I do it gives you an opportunity to have one part that is Visual and the
9:53
other part that is going to engage people through what you're actually saying and once you start to separate
9:59
those as two different things that you have content pillars that's what you say
10:05
and then you have visual topics which is what you show it's going to open up so
10:11
many ideas and it's just going to give you a framework for brainstorming so how
10:17
do you decide your visual topics well it's going to be exactly the same process that we just went through with
10:23
your content pillars and you might actually find in this process that you put stuff that's more of a visual topic
10:29
than um a Content pillar and you might end up sort of switching these around so for example if you put my pet or my dog
10:35
as a Content pillar you might actually find that you don't talk a lot about your dog you just like to show pictures
10:41
of your dog and in the co caption of your pictures of your dog you're talking about your values or your life or you're
10:48
inspiring people or giving them humor so humor would be the content pillar your dog would be the visual topic so if you
10:55
have any questions on that put those down below but basically what you need to do is come up up with again between
11:00
three and five visual topics that you often Post in your social media or that
11:07
you feel people connect with often for a lot of authors this is going to be you
11:13
your face it might also be your actual books or your bookshelf it's usually
11:18
going to involve something about your teasers or your work in progress like quotes or teaser images sometimes it can
11:24
be memes so I'm going to give you an entire list of potential visual topics
11:30
that you might use as an author so I'm going to put these up on the screen but don't forget they're going to be in your
11:35
free spreadsheet as well so it could be hard covers or
Example Visual Topics
11:40
paperbacks or Kindle editions of your book cover you could share photos of
11:46
your characters teasers of your book swag fashion your computer or laptop
11:54
might be a visual topic your bookshelf your desk
12:00
stacks of notebooks or your other planning and stationary supplies you meaning your face or you sitting at your
12:07
desk or in your office your family Nature Flowers these kind of things
12:14
coffee or coffee mugs your pets memes or quotes this is really just
12:21
the tip of the ice bark you could brainstorm and it could be anything one of my visual topics is actually Hello
12:26
Kitty so it could be Disney could be a fandom that you love but it's really anything that shows off your personality
12:33
that attracts your ideal reader visually or it's just something that is aesthetic
12:38
for you to look at but for example I might have a picture of me holding up my
12:44
coffee mug that is the visual topic is me or coffee coffee mugs if you collect
12:49
them something like that but my caption which is my content pillar isn't going
12:55
to be about me and coffee the caption might be an inspirational post about why
13:00
I got up this morning to get my writing done so that's how you begin to pair the visual with the caption or the content
13:09
pillar so what we're going to do next Once you have decided on your content pillars and your visual topics is I'm
13:15
going to show you how to brainstorm mixing and matching them so that you can come up with dozens of social media
13:22
ideas very quickly so let's go to my screen this is the fun part here is your
Content Brainstorm Template
13:28
social media brainstorming template that hopefully is going to revolutionize things for you in terms of your
13:34
brainstorming just like it has for me so it's pretty simple I have two different
13:39
tabs here on the bottom the first one is your actual content brainstorm that you can copy and fill out as often as you
13:46
want and then you also have these same ideas so I gave you these content pillar examples for authors the visual topics
13:53
for authors and then we have example content types so what I'm talking about here is what type of content are you
13:59
creating are you creating a video is it long form or short form is it a real a
14:04
short or Tik Tok which you can often repurpose is it a carousel post where like on Instagram or Facebook you have
14:11
multiple images that people can scroll through is it just one static photo or is it text only like a caption only and
14:18
there's no photo involved so you'll use that and then also deciding your own
14:24
content pillars once you have decided which three to five cont content pillars
14:29
and three to five visual topics you're going to use you're going to start to plug that in on this spreadsheet so all
14:36
of your content pillars will go here on the left where it's blue and of course you can just come up here to this little
14:41
fill color and you can change it to your own brand and in fact you can even say custom color and you can put your exact
14:48
colors in here and I'll show you how I did that in a minute and then you're going to just say what's your content
14:53
pillar number one these don't necessarily have to go in any kind of order but you might want want to put the
14:59
one that you use the most so your your number one content pillar would go here so if it is something along the lines of
15:06
my books like what I'm my work in progress and my backlist you might put that here then You' put your second
15:12
content pillar and third and fourth and fifth and if you need another one you can just copy this and paste it down to
15:18
give yourself a sixth or if you're not using some of these you can just select these rows and delete them then across
15:24
the top we have our visual topics so you have visual topic number one remember
15:30
the visual topic is different from your content pillar in that your content pillar is the actual text or what you're
15:37
saying the visual topic is what you're showing what people see the actual image
15:42
or video that they see on the screen so visual topic number one might be you my
15:48
face whatever it is visual topic number two might also be your books but we're
15:53
talking about images of your books visual topic number three might be your
15:58
desk or stationary and so on and so you just put those topics in here and then what we're going to do is you'll see
16:05
that now it has created this grid and we're just going to mix and match and marry these to give yourself pretty much
16:12
unlimited content ideas so let me show you what this looks like on my own
Sarra Cannon Example
16:19
little branded spreadsheet here so I have as you can see I put my little logo
16:24
here in the corner I have two Brands so I have my Sarah Canan author brand and then I have the brand of the video that
16:30
you're watching right now which is my author coaching brand called heart breathing so I have a tab for each one
16:36
of those Brands and they both have their own visual topics across the top and
16:42
content pillars along the side so let's just go over those so the content buckets or topics that I most commonly
16:49
talk about in my captions are the about me or why I love and started writing
16:54
like why writing is important to me my work in progress which right now is called the The Disappearance of Vanessa
16:59
Shaw I currently love so this is what I'm currently reading watching or
17:04
playing I don't actually uh indulge in this content bucket as often on my
17:10
Instagram as I do in my Facebook group so you might also find that certain platforms get certain types of content
17:17
where others don't for example on Tik Tok you might want to be a lot more
17:22
niched in like you may only have one content pillar that you use on Tik Tok whereas on Instagram you have five so
17:29
that could be something that you could separate out as well another one for me is inspiration and encouragement and
17:35
then backlist is another one so not just my work in progress but my backlist
17:42
books now you could just put those in one content pillar and just say my books but I like to keep them separate so I
17:48
remember to talk about both and then I also have added a sixth content pillar which is community because this is one
17:55
of my most important just reasons for being an author so those are my content pillars or my topics my visual topics
18:03
are me and my family so my kids or me and my husband my office or desk on
18:08
Sarah Canon it's often this keyboard in front of me uh or my desk or even sometimes here in my office I have my
18:15
plotting wall quotes So this could be teasers or other things coffee shop so I
18:22
am off and out at coffee shops writing so I include that in my visuals um Hello
18:27
Kitty because she is my ba I love Hello Kitty I have her all over my offices all over everywhere and you don't have to
18:34
include something kind of fun like this but for me I write young adult fiction so it fits my brand I also like to post
18:41
things that are just sort of fun and Youthful and Hello Kitty is often just part of my desk and Decor so Hello Kitty
18:48
is one of my content visual topics then memes is another one so again I have six
18:55
instead of just five you could also just have two or three if you want so memes would be of course things that are you
19:02
know what memes are so I don't have to cover that um but basically these are my six content buckets and visual topics
19:10
when I want to brainstorm any content I can just come in here and I can take one
19:17
here and one here which brings me to this little corner right here and I can just start adding in my ideas so I could
19:24
say okay if I take a visual topic of me and I'm talking about my why then I
19:30
could say the content type here is going to be a real and the platform I'm going to do is Instagram and I'm going to put
19:36
it in my Facebook group and maybe I'll put it on YouTube shorts also so when it
19:42
comes to the visual I'm going to be relying on the type of content along
19:47
with this visual content bucket so I'm going to want to since I'm making a real
19:52
either take a series of photos that I can put to music or I want to take a short video that is of me and my family
20:00
or me and I'm going to talk about my why so the visual component would be a video
20:05
of me let's say typing on my keyboard the caption is going to be this
20:14
part of the equation the content bucket here on the left and I'm going to be creating a caption that is specifically
20:21
about me or about my why so I might decide this is going to be an introduction post so I take a video of
20:27
me typing on my keyboard and the caption will say hi readers I'm
20:33
Sarah I thought it was about time to introduce myself and then of course I
20:39
would come in here and I would actually put anything I wanted to use to introduce myself but I could fill out
20:46
this entire caption and I could say like here's a little bit about me these are the kind of books that I write and
20:52
here's why I wanted to be a writer in the first place and what this is going to do is this is going to VIs visually
20:58
connect people with me my face me typing on my computer and a piece of content
21:04
about me that I think that they'll be interested in as my ideal readers which is here's why I started writing in the
21:10
first place then if I want to sit down and come up with another content idea I can still take this content bucket about
21:16
me and why I love to write and combine it with a visual of my office or my desk
21:23
so I could come out here and say this content type is going to be a carousel and the platform is going to be
21:30
Instagram and I'm going to post it to my Facebook page the visual is going to be four photos of my office and I could if
21:39
I wanted to get more specific about this instead of just the brainstorming phase I could actually list what those four
21:44
photos are going to be for planning purposes but then the caption could also be about if I'm going to talk about
21:51
about me or why I love writing I could tell a little story here about when I
21:57
first felt in love with being a writer so even though the visual topic is my office which is going to appeal to my
22:04
ideal reader the content and the connection is going to be found in the
22:10
caption where I tell them about as a little girl I used to dream of having an office like this and I always wanted to
22:17
be a writer and part of why I wanted to be a writer was because I didn't fit in with the popular girls and so I ended up
22:23
spending a lot of my time in the Woods reading books like I could tell that story um so the caption could be my
22:30
story of growing up isolated and
22:35
reading all the time wishing and praying for an office like
22:42
this and being a writer so when you're brainstorming you
22:47
don't have to actually list all the details of stuff but if you take 15 20
22:53
30 minutes or even an hour and you just start combining your your content pillar
22:59
with your visual topic it's going to be a framework to start brainstorming what
23:05
in the world you could put on here and you can basically pair all of these and once you have six visual topics times
23:13
six different content buckets you've got 36 potential posts for the month and
23:20
beyond that you could go and post right now so this for me has been GameChanger
23:26
so one of the reasons that this can be so helpful not only is it going to help you brainstorm stuff without having to
23:31
just sit alone in your room thinking what in the world am I going to post but it's also going to help your brand have
23:37
consistency because people are going to see your office or your desk over and over again which gives it that same kind
23:43
of color or type of photo over and over again and it's going to make you recognizable it's going to give you
23:49
personality it's going to give you consistency it's going to let people know what your values are and it's
23:54
really going to endear them to you because you're talking about things that you know they're interested in and then
23:59
you're showing them things that you also know they're interested in when you combine those two things it's super
24:05
super powerful for social media engagement and growth so let's go down to another one so as you can see we
24:10
could do this about me with all of these quotes coffee shops Hello Kitty and what was my last one was my
24:16
memes so let's go down here and we could say okay let's talk about something
24:21
that's going to be for my backlist and have a picture of me some kind of visual of me so let's say here we're going to
24:28
make a content type that's just a standalone photo and I'm going to post it to my Facebook page and my Instagram
24:36
and the visual would just be a photo of me because the content topic is me with
24:42
my kids reading a book right one of my books reading a SDS book we'll say
24:49
Shadow Demon book so the caption here might tell a story that engages people
24:55
with my backlist books because it's telling telling them something about me and so here it might say in 2010 when I
25:03
first published beautiful demons which is my backlist book my very
25:08
first book I had no idea what my life would be like
25:14
now and I could post a story here about that type of writer that I was and
25:20
why that book meant so much to me and how much more it means to me now I have kids like that's just one example but
25:26
you could create inless amounts of content combining your backlist with a photo of you or your backlist with a
25:32
photo of your desk or your backlist with a quote right so you could say if you said backlist and quote here sorry let
25:40
me make it a little bit easier to see everything see if I can make this smaller okay just in the interest of
25:46
being able to see both at the same time if I wanted to brainstorm backlist as a
25:52
Content pillar and a quote as the image I could say content type and we could
25:58
say real or whatever I'm going to post this let's say to Instagram and my
26:04
visual is going to be a quote right so let's say I'm going to do a background
26:09
of my book cover enlarged
26:16
with a uh Shadow Demons quote floating on the top of
26:25
it or scrolling over the top right so I would go into canva and I would create this background or backdrop with my
26:32
cover art and I would put one of the most highlighted quotes you can go on to Kindle and you can see what's the most
26:37
highlighted or one of your favorite quotes and put that over the top or you could talk about the tropes or something like that and then in the caption you
26:44
would talk about your content pillar which is your backlist so you would say
26:49
something along the lines of uh you could you could repeat the
26:56
quote and then then you could say beautiful demons is perfect for fans of such and
27:03
such and it's you could put the something here about um how it's the beginning of a series or here's the
27:10
types of people that would really love this book and you could really talk about why they should read the first
27:15
book in your series and so hopefully you can start to see like if I went through
27:21
and I combined all of these my work in progress combined with a quote which could be a teaser for my work in
27:26
progress my work in progress combined with a visual of the coffee shop would be me working out at a coffee shop and
27:32
talking about the book that I'm writing Hello Kitty would be something along the lines it's like how do you combine Hello
27:38
Kitty with your work in progress well what I could do is I could have a bunch of Hello Kitties sitting on my desk and
27:44
I could talk about how as I'm working on The Disappearance of Vanessa Shaw I'm using my Hello Kitty pens or something
27:50
like that and I could have that as the visual but the caption is about how I'm working on my book and you could take
27:56
all of these content ideas and begin to fill this entire grid out and you would have over A month's worth of social
28:02
media post ideas in just a matter of minutes now in my heart breathing is
Heart Breathings Example
28:08
just to give you an example of a different type here my content pillars for heart breathings my topics that I
28:15
talk about there's five about me and my why like why am I a writer why am I helping fellow authors my writing
28:22
process I talk about productivity I talk about inspiration and encouragement
28:27
which really if I narrow this down I talk a lot about joy in the process like
28:33
how to maintain your joy as a writer and then I also give writing tips and advice
28:38
which also is kind of like self-publishing advice more so than just writing but it's really any of those
28:44
kind of things can fall under that same bucket my visual pillars are me and my family again my office which can be my
28:51
shelves and my desk not this office but the one I was in at the beginning of the video my stationer so I have stacks of
28:57
notebooks and I have my pins and my washi tape and things like that coffee
29:03
or um mugs are often in my visuals so for example if I'm talking about my
29:08
writing process and I want to use a visual of coffee I might come here and say my content type is going to be a
29:14
real my platform is going to be Instagram and my visual is going to be me making my morning
29:21
coffee and in the caption I'm going to talk about my writing process I'm not going to talk about the coffee I might
29:28
have one little line in there about the coffee but I'm going to talk about my writing process and I'm going to combine this visual topic with my actual content
29:36
pillar so I might say something like I can't get started or I've I've
29:42
been uh making it a point lately
29:47
to start writing first thing in the morning so you can see how people will
29:54
naturally combine that with the idea of having coffee cuz we often make our our coffee first thing in the morning but what I'm really talking about is my
30:00
writing process this idea of sitting down and being consistent and sometimes you're going to find that pillars begin
30:06
to mesh with each other and when you can touch on multiple pillars that's great so for example I might have me making my
30:13
morning coffee and then also sitting down with a notebook and I can talk about my writing process but also add in
30:19
something inspirational here about how I've been creating this new morning routine and it's helping me get so many
30:25
more words which is naturally going to Inspire other people to sit down make their great you know morning changes or
30:32
whatever so that they can sit down and have a dedicated writing time too so you'll find that these begin to mesh but
30:38
it can be so helpful just to have this grid make these choices and then start mixing and matching them so let me know
30:45
in the comments if you feel like this is going to be super helpful for you so I have given you this starter spreadsheet
30:52
you can just go to file and click make a copy to make a
30:58
copy for your own that you can edit and change or you can go to download and you
31:04
can download it as an Excel spreadsheet or even as a PDF if you want to so that you can fill this out for yourself and
31:11
you can change it and add your own topics and your own logo and your own colors and anything you may want to do with it if you can combine this with
31:19
trending audio and sounds that you find on Tik Tok or YouTube shorts or on Instagram then you've really got your
31:27
system in place so be sure that when you're doing your own scrolling and you're looking at comparing not only
31:32
just authors in your genre but also just people you enjoy watching think about these content pillars and how you can
31:38
save trending sounds trending sort of combinations of things and fit it into
31:44
your own content pillars and visual topics I hope this has been super helpful again go to that link down below

bye [Music]
hello everybody welcome back to heart breathings i am actually like knee-deep in post-it
0:05
notes and planning for q4 but before we dive into the goodness and
0:11
fun of prep tober and nanowrimo and all the lovely things of all i did want to leave you with one
0:18
final how to plan a series q a so i'll be starting off from the second set of questions that i
0:24
received and like i said i'm sorry i'm not going to get to answer every single question that came through i tried to stick to the ones that seemed
0:31
to be series specific although we will get into some marketing stuff today that's going to be really
0:36
fun to talk about so let's jump in [Music]
0:43
so are there reader expectations in different genres regarding how time passes from one book to another
Reader Expectations
0:50
inside the fictional world for the characters for example i'm writing a romance series with a new couple
0:56
featured in each book at the moment i'm planning to have each book take place in the next season that
1:01
follows so book one in winter book two in spring etc i assume that's fine as long as this
1:06
is consistent throughout the series i'm asking if it matters and what are the rules of thumb so
Timing
1:12
when it comes to how time passes inside your series most of the readers in every series are
1:19
going to be expecting time to pass chronologically so if you have a book that is in winter for book one
1:26
and spring in book two you just wanna make sure that it's the very next season which it sounds like that's what you're
1:31
planning to do it doesn't matter if it's been three months or even six months between books when it comes to romances
1:38
i think it's fine for time to pass whatever is natural for your characters and whatever
1:43
that next couple needs to get them into place so it would be totally fine if the next
1:48
book picked up right away and then if you waited six months for the next book to come in terms of what's
1:53
happening inside the story world so i think with romances it's just what's appropriate
1:59
with dynamic series where you've got maybe a cliffhanger ending or something like that most readers are going to
2:06
expect that next book to pick up immediately from where you left them or very soon thereafter
2:12
but the main rule of thumb is that things are chronological so that as things progress in the story
2:18
or in your town or in your story world in some way readers are able to follow that chronologically and that's really the
2:24
biggest rule of thumb when it comes to romances like the one you're talking about though
2:30
my biggest warning for you if you're planning to do one in winter one in spring one in summer one in fall is to start
2:37
out a little bit ahead so that you can really plan those releases to be pretty consistent
2:44
because if you get a little bit behind and now your spring book isn't coming out until fall
2:50
and your fall book is coming out in the summer it can start to feel a little bit off of course once the
2:56
books are all out it's not really going to matter which season they came out in and readers are used to reading books of all seasons in
3:03
all seasons so that is not going to matter as much but when it comes to timing those releases if you're making the seasons
3:10
part of your launch strategy and part of the overall feel of the series i would start out a little bit ahead so
3:16
that you don't get in a situation where you get off on your seasons and you can't
3:22
catch back up another warning that i have for that scenario is if you're starting book one in winter
3:28
my some of my biggest advice to people is don't start off your whole series with a seasonal book like a holiday book
3:35
so don't start with a christmas book because your first book in your series is going to become
3:40
your biggest marketing tool when it comes to bringing new readers into your series and a christmas book just isn't going to
3:47
sell as well in february and march and july as
3:52
just a regular romance novel that wasn't based on a seasonal theme so that's my biggest warning there is
3:58
don't start with a christmas book don't start with a novella start with a full length book that is not based on a seasonal
4:05
theme that will be popular during one time of the year rather than another regular book that just happens to be in
4:11
winter no problem christmas book can get tricky should you set up an llc
LLC vs Sole Proprietorship
4:16
or sole proprietorship when you start or wait to set up an llc when your books start making money
4:22
for example 5k or more per month so again this is not really a series specific
4:27
question this is more of just a self-publishing question and i will say i go into depth in this on
4:33
my publish and thrive course so if you really want to get deep into this kind of stuff hang out until february and we can
4:39
discuss it in greater detail along with all the things you need to set up your business but i did want to just touch on this
4:46
that the main types of businesses you will see authors in the us start when they're starting their
4:52
self-publishing business is you have a sole proprietorship you don't usually have to do much to set that up
4:58
or anything it's just an automatic business designation and there's no real difference between a
5:04
sole proprietorship and an llc when it comes to how your money is taxed what the difference usually is is the
5:11
level of liability that you have personally to your business so if you're a sole proprietor you are fully liable for everything your
5:18
business does and everything you do as a writer in your personal life when you set up an
LLC vs DBA
5:24
llc you have a little bit of limited liability there when it comes to separation between your personal assets
5:30
and your business assets but basically your tax is treated the same then you do have some people that
5:35
will set up a dba which is a doing business as which is basically just like a fictional business name again doesn't provide you
5:42
any tax benefits but does give you a little bit of privacy or a little bit more of like a professional nature to your
5:49
business name but then the one thing that some authors will do when they start making more
5:55
money is they will set up an s corp designation to their llc if you're listening to this and you're
6:01
like ah this makes no sense to me what you'll want to do instead of just listening to my advice
6:07
is go and talk to an accountant because i can't legally give you advice on what is the best way to set up your business
6:14
and it's just a good idea when you're starting your own business to really talk to an accountant it's not that
6:20
expensive talk to somebody who knows about online businesses or specifically digital online businesses and this sort of thing
6:27
and go from there but it's so important to understand which one is the best for you i will tell you
6:34
that my accountant told me early on that i should go ahead and start an llc
6:39
just to have that business going and then once i started making forty fifty thousand dollars he suggested i
6:45
started an llc that's an s corp designation and that was what i did and it has worked out
6:51
great for me but again you'll want to do what your accountant recommends that you do or what's best for your personal situation
6:58
and it can also really vary depending on what state you live in in terms of what's best for you
7:03
so definitely check out those different types of businesses and see what feels best for you but just
7:09
keep in mind that a sole proprietorship puts all the personal liability on you whereas an llc puts a little bit of
Series Wiki
7:17
separation there between your personal liability and your business liability so there was um someone here that says
7:23
would really love more information about setting up a wiki for your series bible mainly linking like linking your
7:28
characters and books and places etc so i'm going to just barely touch on this here to say that i'm very excited
7:34
just to get into a new type of series wiki so in the past i've talked about using
7:40
one on pbworks.com i'm actually starting a wiki and pretty much all of my
7:46
business stuff now that i have an assistant is going to be set up inside notion and i realized that you can do
7:54
wikis inside notion so it's not something i'm going to talk about here but i will tell you that
7:59
coming up i will be doing a full walk through of setting up my new wiki inside notion so i'm going
8:07
to be setting up a wiki for my book the witch's key and for that whole series before i start working on book
8:12
two so i will carry you through the process and show you real life examples of how you link all of those things together so
8:19
make sure you're subscribed if you're interested in seeing how i create my series bible inside of wiki because i will be
8:25
covering it in detail another good question here that i could probably talk about for hours if you were just starting out
8:31
today and planning on self-publishing a series how would you go about doing it would you rapid release how often how
8:38
many books what kind of marketing would you do thanks so much i love your channel thank you for this question i will say
8:45
that there is so much nuance to launching your career figuring all these things out so
8:51
there is a lot more to say about this and maybe we'll touch on some of this later i definitely go into depth on this
8:57
in my publish and thrive course but to answer your question if i was just
9:02
starting out today i would first make the choice of whether you planned long term to be
9:09
exclusive to amazon inside their kindle unlimited exclusive program or wide which means that you're going to
9:15
publish at all the different vendors apple google kobo barnes noble and
Kindle Unlimited vs Wide
9:21
i personally am a huge fan of publishing wide because i think that it is safer and just a better
9:29
long-term experience to have your books available everywhere rather than giving amazon sole control over your entire career and
9:36
all of your income but that's going to be a personal decision that you'll have to make for yourself and i support authors who choose
9:43
whichever way works best for them i personally if i was starting out i would go wide
9:48
because that would be my long-term goal to be available in as many places as possible for as many readers as possible
9:54
and to make sure that i don't have all my eggs in one basket so to speak but there can be different launch
10:01
strategies based on kindle unlimited versus wide so i'm just going to talk about what i would do personally
10:07
which is go wide make my books widely available so they're available on all platforms and i would probably start with
10:15
a book series that was going to be at least five to ten books long i think that trilogies can be fun to
10:22
write but when it comes to launching your first thing the longer the series the more you're
10:28
gonna be able to hook people and bring them in with a trilogy or something short you're gonna just have barely started to build
10:35
momentum when you're starting something new and starting a new series can pull some readers over but you'll
10:42
also lose readers whereas when you have a series that's building momentum which you should be
10:47
building momentum by book three or four you want to keep that going for as long as possible so i personally would plan
10:54
probably a six to ten book series and i would start out with book one and then book two would come
How I would plan a series
11:01
out probably about six weeks to two months later and then book three also following on
11:07
its heels six weeks to two months later so i would keep those first three books
11:12
pretty rapid release it's not as rapid release as people who are releasing books every three weeks but i know that
11:17
for myself that's not going to be sustainable and it's not going to be healthy for me to try to publish that fast so
11:24
it's just my personal preference two months is still pushing it so i would probably write those first two books before i
11:30
started publishing so i'd have two books under my belt published the first one while i was waiting to publish book two
11:37
i would be writing book three and i would try to always stay about a book ahead i also before i started publishing would
Building an author platform
11:44
probably start gathering some sort of or start building some sort of author
11:50
platform so instagram a facebook page a website start building a newsletter list even
11:56
before i started publishing then as soon as i published book one i would make sure that i had some kind of
12:03
place and reason to encourage people to sign up for my newsletter list so in the back of the book i would say if you
12:09
loved this book booktube is coming on xyz date sign up for my newsletter list to get a
12:16
special sneak peek of chapter one and get people involved in that list because the sooner you can start getting
12:22
people onto your newsletter list the better because that's how you're going to tell them about your book too
12:27
i when i first started my career i launched my first book at 99 cents and my second book at 99 cents and i
12:33
think this was a good call for me back then because there was no place to really advertise if i was starting now though i would put
12:40
that first book probably at 299 or 399. so i would
12:46
build that author platform get my newsletter in place make sure that i have my website good to go
12:51
and then i would release book one i probably wouldn't spend personally a lot of time or money trying to get a big launch plan going
12:58
for book one instead i would focus on making sure book two was ready to go maybe i would do a pre-order in book two
13:04
but i'm not 100 certain i would have to kind of think through my strategy there but whenever book two was ready to come
13:11
out i would release it let's say six weeks later at that point i would
13:16
drop book one to 99 cents for just a short period of time and use this as my loss leader so that
Loss leader
13:23
readers will take a chance on this new series for only a dollar and i would probably stack some ads
13:28
maybe try some facebook ads and some bargain book c and other type of deal sites ads just
13:34
for a week or two and stack them all together bring as many new readers into my series as possible
13:39
and make sure the back matter of book one leads them directly to book two with a direct link that says
13:45
book two is out now come and get it come buy it some kind of tagline that entices them
13:51
you know if you love harper's story she's got new secrets come see what happens in book two something like that
13:56
with a link to go buy it on the specific platform where they purchased book one then after about a week or two i would
14:03
raise the price of book one back up to full price and be focused on getting book three ready for publication
14:10
when book three came out six weeks later i would do the same process lower book 1 to 99 cents and use that as
14:17
the loss leader the magnet that pulls people in directly send them to book 2 and then on
14:23
to book 3. make sure along the way that i'm trying to get them onto my newsletter list so that as soon as a new
14:28
book comes out i've got a large list or a growing list to launch that book to to let them know the book
14:35
is out i would just rinse and repeat basically book one comes back up to full price but
14:40
this time after those first three books have come out pretty fast back to back i would probably take a little bit more
14:47
time for book four this is a personal preference some people will say get those books out as
14:52
fast as you can i say get those books out in a way that is sustainable for you not only for
14:59
your mental health but for your quality of writing so write the best books you can
15:04
as fast as you can but since we did talk earlier about series fatigue pay attention to that and
15:10
understand that if you start writing that series really really fast you might hit a stage of burnout and
15:17
then you're gonna need a really long break so think about that when you're planning your strategy so for me after book
15:22
three's release i would probably plan the next book book four for maybe three to four months
15:30
later do the same process of driving as many sales to book one as possible
15:35
advertising my new release to my current readers and then continue that process all the way
15:40
through i would definitely stick with one series one genre at a time until i had a good
15:47
strong email list and a good base behind me and that's where i would focus my time and my money and my energy if
Audio
15:53
you were to look at audio would you rather wait until finished all books or risk a different
15:58
va and i'm assuming va means voice actor so i really don't have many audio books i only have three audio
16:05
books and i do use the same voice actor for all three and i did produce those after the whole series almost was completed if
16:13
i were to start a new series and i was looking at audio it is something i hear from my friends
16:18
time and time again that if you can put out that audiobook as close to the launch
16:24
of the e-book and paperback you're going to sell more books so i think that if i were looking at audio i would try my best
16:30
to time the release of the audiobook with the release of the book now you can't do that with backlists
16:36
because those books you know launch has come and gone but if it was a new series i would try to
16:42
line them up as much as possible but like i said i don't have a lot of experience with audiobooks so you might
16:48
get better information from someone like joanna penn who does have a lot of audio books or maybe even mark dawson
16:54
who i believe also has all of his books in audio how do you accurately respectfully and intentionally write
17:00
with inclusivity and diversity so this is a really tough question and i think it's something important that we all need to be
17:07
thinking about because i think that a lot of writers lean heavily on our own experience
17:13
as well as stereotypes we don't even know we have biases we don't even have and we work
17:19
within the limitations of our own minds our own experience the lens that we see the world with
17:25
so what we're all kind of waking up to these days is an understanding that if we are going
17:31
to write with inclusivity and make sure that we are being fair and
Writing with inclusivity
17:40
sensitive to all races and types of people then we need to make sure that our
17:47
writing reflects that i think that
17:52
i don't have an amazing answer to this other than the fact that you're already aware that you want to write this way is a big
18:00
step forward so i can even look back at some of my past books and i think
18:05
is that the best way that i could have had to write that did i write that more stereotypical than i should have
18:10
so i think it's really a matter of awareness and education so reaching out to authors who teach
18:17
courses there are going to be probably even more courses coming up on this there are several courses taught through
18:23
rwa and other writing groups that are all about diversity and inclusivity i know that a lot of
18:29
authors are actually very nervous to write more diverse characters that don't look like you or
18:34
talk like you or have your same experiences because you don't want to get it wrong and i think that that's a good thing to
18:40
be aware of but i also think that if you know you want to include more diversity in your writing
18:46
it's good to really question yourself along the way do some reading it with other books that
18:52
are about these types of diverse characters make sure that you're running your book through a diverse set of beta readers
18:59
asking specifically for them to take a look at this for example i have a book about a native american legend
19:05
that is totally made up it's fantasy but it does go based on the idea of spirit walkers
19:11
in native american culture and my heroine is native american so i reached out to a couple of native
19:17
american teens and had them read through the book they helped me make some changes so i
19:22
think that reaching out to the community and getting as much information as you can
19:27
um but i think we're gonna be seeing some boundaries pushed with this and i think the main thing you can do is just
19:33
be open and aware and try your best to question your own limitations your own
19:39
biases that you might be writing into things and make sure that when you craft these characters you're doing it out of love instead of
19:46
just a knee-jerk reaction to what you've seen on tv or the way some other people have been portrayed in past
19:52
books or movies that you've watched before this is going to be a growing topic and the more i learn about it the more i
19:58
hope that i can share with you but i'm glad that you asked the question and i think the best we can do is just continue to be aware and educate
20:05
ourselves can you show an example or create a template for the style guide
Style guide example
20:10
so i will show you an example of one that was given back to me for my book forgotten darkness
20:16
from my editor faith williams at the atwater group so let me show you that real quick and this will give you a good
20:21
idea of what a style guide might look like so this is just an example from my own book and this is a style sheet that i
20:28
got from my editor faith at the atwater group and so this is 20
20:34
pages for my book forgotten darkness if you are currently reading through the demon series with me
20:40
then just understand that some of this might be spoilers so just be careful or fast forward a little
20:45
bit if you don't want to be spoiled on some of this but she basically lists the character name anything
20:51
that i said about that character in previous books or in this book itself what color hair she has what color
20:58
eyes she has any other type of thing that we need to know about her things she's done in her past
21:04
or things that she like she's a senior in high school or she spent her life in the foster care system
21:10
what relationships she has to other people and so this first part is about the different characters that
21:16
are the main characters that you see in the series so the reason this is a great thing to get
21:22
from your editor is that she can then look at this next time or
21:28
when i'm writing the next book in the series i can look back at this as well and i can see what details
21:33
were part of this so i can use this to actually add to my series bible and these are the
21:39
types of things that you would see in a series bible so it would let you
21:45
know the name of characters and she even goes into side characters and other recurring characters who are not pov
21:51
characters so you get pretty much any type of comparison like
21:57
this person's in the same prison is airden um or they're tall or they have black eyes
22:03
and this sort of thing so later when i come back to writing the next book in the series i can say what was the name of that prison guard
22:09
oh okay his name was karn and he was the mean guy who picked on the week and you can see kind of what
22:15
chapter or what part of the book that was mentioned in then you can see
22:20
down on these further pages she gets into mentioning locations so
22:26
priestess winter's home is called winterhaven and there's no description here that i've given because this was
22:31
something from a previous book but if she had edited all of my books she would have
22:36
this in the style guide as well so brighton manor or northern kingdom is ruled by leah's
22:43
father and so on so we know a lot about all of these different places and locations
22:49
then we also have a list of all the names of chapters and whose point of view those chapters
22:56
are in which page they start and so on how many pages are in each chapter
23:01
and that's just good to have for reference and then later here she also has some she has
23:07
some notes on things notes that she made inside my book and an explanation of why i might want
23:13
to change it and what she suggests so based on this i would suggest capitalizing little miss rules
23:19
and so on so these are all like annotations from the manuscript itself and why she would make these stylistic
23:25
changes then there are also some sort of style things for you word uses that i say
23:31
fairy tale is two words or ice pick is one word and she's saying it should be two words not one
23:37
so just kind of spelling errors and other things word choice further instead of farther so this is
23:43
just her not only telling me that it needs to change but a really great editor will tell you why
23:49
so that as the writer you can now learn and you can say oh okay now i understand the difference between
23:54
further and farther and why i need to use it differently so this is not only
23:59
helping me make the book better but it's actually teaching me so that when i write the next book it will be a better book those are the
24:06
kinds of things that you will find and see here on the like locations and stuff like that you see how words are
24:12
capitalized so this is just an example of my style sheet that i got from my editor and i highly recommend finding an editor
24:19
if you can who provides one of these so another question that i had was are short 3 to 4k shorts sellable
Are short stories sellable
24:28
so yes and no it somewhat depends on the genre and whether you're very good at writing them
24:34
so i would say that the biggest challenge that you might have with short stories like three to four
24:40
thousand words is pricing because they're super short so you can charge 99 cents for them
24:46
and some people are willing to pay a dollar for them and that's fine but it might be a stretch to expect
24:52
people to pay three four or five dollars for a single 4 000 word short without them feeling like
24:57
they kind of got ripped off one of the things you'll see a lot of authors do if they love to write short stories and they want to write them all
25:03
in a theme or based on a single world or just bundle all of their short stories together is they'll create
25:08
an anthology of their short stories then you can charge a full-length novel price for a handful of those short stories and
25:15
then readers feel like they got what they paid for one of the big exceptions to this of course is erotic
25:20
romance erotic romance shorts sell much better than most other types of genres because what
25:26
the reader is looking to get from them is very different than what a reader is coming to a mystery series or something
25:32
like that to get so you need to think about your audience but i really feel like if you wanted to
25:37
create an entire career based on just selling three to four thousand word shorts you could absolutely do it
How to sell short stories
25:44
because that's the beauty of indie is everything is sellable there's an audience for just about anything you
25:50
could want to do out there if you decide this is what you want to do is you're really good at shorts and this is what you love
25:56
to write then just come up with a strategy create a price be willing to experiment and then i
26:01
would highly suggest that once you have 3 4 5 10 under your belt you begin boxing
26:07
them up into anthologies or sets so that you can charge a higher price for them and hopefully get
26:13
readers more enticed to buy the whole set and feel like they're getting a deal rather than just buying one at a time
26:19
but i think they're absolutely sellable particularly in erotic fiction but in all types of fiction i think you could
26:25
make it work if they were really good that being said i don't particularly have any friends
26:30
that that's like all they write and i wouldn't recommend putting three or four thousand word
26:36
short stories into your series like as book three or book four when you had full-length series before
26:41
that full-length books before that so if you're gonna sell short stories i would
26:46
come up with a specific strategy and stick to that rather than trying to like sneak them in
26:52
as a book three or a book five some of the different vendors will allow you to make
26:57
a short story like a 0.5 like it's 2.5 in your series but not all of them so to stay consistent i would recommend
27:04
just keeping the short stories out of your main series so my friend vivian you guys might know
How to make a series arc long
27:09
her here from youtube she said how to make a series arc long enough for six plus books i know that this is a
27:16
challenge for a lot of people i think that what you need to start thinking about when you want to write like you know you want to write a bigger series
27:23
is you've got to start thinking of a bigger story so think about who your character is at
27:30
the beginning of the story and then think about who they need to become by the end of it and what types
27:35
of challenges can you put in their way so that it's going to take them naturally five six or more books to get
27:42
to that final villain so think about the harry potter series for example when
27:48
you have that very first book you've got a big introduction to harry and the world and everything there
27:55
but you also get introduced to this really big series arc and you know all this history now about
28:01
voldemort but you also know that he's back but he's not quite powerful enough and harry's not powerful enough either
28:08
so as the series progresses you have the villain beginning to gather his tribe together
28:14
again and his strength but you also have harry gathering his tribe and his strength
28:19
and so it becomes this race to see who's going to be strong enough in the end and will harry become strong
28:26
enough and skilled enough by the time baltimore is fully powerful or will voldemort
28:31
beat him and then you know all is lost so you have those stakes set up right from the beginning
28:38
when it comes to a young adult series like that or a middle grade series it is pretty common
28:44
or popular to have either one big villain or an overarching sort of organization
28:50
or something like that and each book provides a different piece of the puzzle but every book
28:56
brings your heroin or hero closer to that final confrontation so i think when
29:02
you're trying to make sure that you have enough content for five six or more books you really need to
29:08
think about what's the long game here not just what happens in this first book or what's the world that my character
29:14
lives in but what's the overarching villain what's the big bad what's the stakes of this world what's
29:21
the worst thing that could happen and how will my character need to grow how can i
29:26
make this big bad thing or person or organization so bad that it's going to take my
29:34
character that many books just to become strong enough and to gather the tools and resources they need
29:40
to defeat this villain with my shadow demon saga it all starts very small and you're just
29:45
starting to learn about the order of shadows and then you know you find out the order of shadows is bigger than you thought
29:52
and then it's bigger than you thought and the world just continues to grow so if you can create a world that has these layers like kind of like
29:59
an onion that can help you too but it's just having some kind of overarching conflict or stakes in the
30:06
world that's just gonna take time to resolve can you talk about a series like are you afraid of the dark it's
Are you afraid of the dark
30:12
contained are those popular so i had to go and look this up because it seemed familiar
30:17
to me but i wasn't sure and here's what wikipedia says this spooky anthology series for kids
30:22
recounts ghost stories told by the young members of the midnight society as they gather around a campfire each
30:28
episode opens with members of the midnight society at their secret spot in the woods where they prepare their fire and the
30:34
knights storyteller announces the title of his or her offering however the camera soon leave the storyteller and
30:41
switch to the tail being told so this sounds kind of like the twilight zone or anything where you
30:46
have kind of this framing device where you have something happening here and then this person's telling the story or
30:52
this person introducing a story but every story kind of stands alone i think that this can work but i haven't
30:59
really seen it be very popular in written fiction in this way so maybe you see it more in sort of
31:07
middlegate grade or kids books but i haven't seen a specific series like this doesn't mean that it doesn't exist
31:13
but i would say in terms of what is the most popular thing that indies are writing in terms of series
31:19
this is not something that i have seen done before with this particular type of framing device
31:24
like i said that doesn't mean it wouldn't be popular but it's definitely not something that i've seen done before and if you guys have some
31:31
examples of someone who is writing in this way where every story stands alone but there's some kind of like framing
31:37
device or something that pulls it all together maybe at the beginning and end of the book then please leave those examples
31:42
down below i will say that one of the biggest ways that you can find success
31:48
in an indie career when you're self-publishing is to make your books as connected as
31:54
interconnected as possible the more a reader can get immersed in this world and then have to read the next book to find out
32:01
what happens or they've got to get to that next book to find out about the heroine's brother that they fell in love
32:06
with and they want to see who he falls in love with the more you can really tie those books together
32:11
the faster you're going to find success in this business is what i have seen from personal experience and from
32:16
watching everyone else so when you have something that is like very disconnected
32:22
i think you're going to struggle a little bit more than someone who had a series that was super interconnected so the more you can
32:29
create that framing device that really pulls them all together and then make every story a similar type of feeling for your
32:35
reader the better off you're going to be but in general just keep in mind that
32:41
the more interconnected your series are the more they depend on each other or the more you really
32:46
hook that reader in and make them want to read the next book the better off you're going to be in terms of sales not specific to a series
How to find a writers group
32:53
but hints on finding a writer's group online or in real life i know this is a tricky
32:58
thing people ask about this sort of thing all the time how do i find a writer's group how do i find a critique group how do i
33:04
find beta readers and all i can say is just become part of the community you want to be a part of
33:10
so start following writer's hashtags on instagram join facebook groups like my sprinting
33:16
group it's so important also to try to join local writer groups if you can find them
33:23
depending on where you live that might be really easy or it might be really hard but get yourself out of that shell
33:30
and just start joining some of these groups start participating in writing sprints join an rwa group or a national group
33:38
that is full of writers but the more you can start hanging out with writers try nanowrimo it's coming up soon there
33:44
are local regions for all of the regions and there are lots of online groups where people are wanting
33:50
to exchange stories or encourage each other throughout the writing process that's how i found my best two critique
33:56
groups of my career one was through rwa and i just started going to meetings and starting getting
34:01
involved in the community met some people said hey let's critique together another writing group that i joined i
34:08
met through nanowrimo and this was an amazing experience but you can't just expect those
34:14
experiences to come to you you have to go and seek them out and when you start creating and developing
34:19
relationships with other writers then you can start saying hey do you want to switch some chapters
34:24
and find people who are in similar place to you in terms of where they are in their career and their skill level and
34:30
how long they've been writing and then just start engaging in those relationships see if they want to join a
34:35
writer's group with you i know that there can be sometimes services that will pair you up with people as well
34:40
so like camp nanowrimo you can get added to a cabin or you might find a critique group
34:46
through like your local rwa group but i often find that the most successful types of writer groups are
34:53
the ones where you just started getting involved and started communicating with people started reaching out and saying hi and
34:59
then it just happens organically do you prefer the same beta readers for the whole series or fresh eyes each book
Beta readers
35:05
definitely the same beta readers for the whole series first of all i need beta readers who can help me stay
35:11
consistent so it would do me no good especially because i write a dynamic series to have a beta reader start at book 8
35:19
who necessarily hadn't read the first few books several times so my current beta readers
35:24
have been with me for years not since the beginning of my series 10 years ago but when i met them they had
35:30
already read up to my current book and they had read them several times what you really ideally want in a beta
35:37
reader especially for a dynamic series is someone who is going to be willing to
35:42
say this doesn't feel right for me because they know your characters they know your writing style and they're going to tell you more than
35:49
just this book was great they're going to actually tell you what needs to change what didn't resonate for
35:54
them what didn't feel good sentences that were clunky story lines that didn't appeal to them
35:59
they're going to tell you all those things and they need to be familiar with your writing style with what typical readers of your books
36:06
are used to and enjoy and they're going to need to know more about the previous books in the series
36:12
now if you're writing standalone romances or like standalone psychological thrillers
36:18
or horrors it might be less important to have the same beta readers
36:23
but even then i would personally prefer to have the same
36:29
beta readers because they're going to help me stay consistent with not only the details like was it weren't his eyes
36:34
blue in the last book and that kind of thing but also consistency in my style in my tone like whoa this book got way
36:41
darker than the last one are you sure you want to do that this book is so much sexier than the last one i loved it or
36:47
you know whatever it may be but i think that when you have bettas who are familiar with all of your
36:52
previous books they're gonna typically give better feedback than fresh eyes
How to end a series
36:58
if however you are writing something that is a little bit outside of your
37:03
norm and you think your ideal reader might be a little bit different like say this is a darker book than normal
37:09
it could be beneficial to reach out to someone with fresh eyes and say this is something you haven't read
37:15
before i know you haven't read my books before but i want to know what someone who isn't familiar with my work
37:21
thinks of this and that can be beneficial or for example when i was writing book
37:26
seven of my series i wanted it to be another entry point at the time so i reached out to someone who was
37:32
totally fresh beta reader and asked them to read the book and give me feedback on whether they
37:38
understood what was happening or if i hadn't given enough details so there might be specific reasons you
37:44
might seek out fresh eyes but in general i prefer to use the same beta readers
37:49
how do you end a series or plan the completion of it
37:55
it's hard to end a series especially a really long one i have only ever ended two series in my career
38:01
everything else is still kind of in process and i'm currently writing the final book in one
38:07
series and then i have two books to go in my main long series and it is really tough so some of the
38:15
best advice that i would have for you especially if it's a pretty long series is you need to start planning for that
38:21
end several books in advance so my main series is going to have 12 books but i've been setting up the end of this
38:28
series for the past couple of books already and i've been looking ahead so make sure
38:33
you've got some of that pre-planning so that you can do some foreshadowing you can set up the players like a big old
38:39
chess board also when you start getting toward those last few books you need to make sure that readers are
38:45
emotionally prepared they know that this is kind of coming to an end so they can start to feel the tension
38:51
you also will want to go back through your series and make a list of what i would call
38:56
story threads any little loose ends that haven't been tied up any story questions that never
39:02
got answered things that seemed to start and never went anywhere little details like that and start
39:08
putting together an idea of what you want to close out what threads you want to knock off and
39:14
finish what things are just going to be left to question and how you want to make it all come
39:20
together it's really is kind of like master planning some kind of large art
39:25
project that you want to make sure that you have all of the pieces in play
39:30
so that you can bring it all together it would really suck to get to the end of book 12
39:35
and then have five or six questions that you didn't even consider that were started earlier in the series
39:41
that you never tied off it may not be possible for you to bring everything to a neat
39:46
pretty bow tie at the end but you want to make decisions about what you are going to tie off
39:52
what you are going to answer and what isn't going to get answered so that's probably my best advice but
39:58
hopefully i will have even more advice for you once i do finish my big series about how to finish it
40:04
well but yeah i think when you're planning the
40:10
completion of a series the best thing you can do is just go back and read the whole series over and make sure you're making
40:16
detailed notes about every thread story thread that isn't answered or that was left hanging and
40:22
make sure you tie up as many of those loosens as possible i think when it comes to the end of a series 2
40:29
you want that epic feel you want to really think about who has my character become through the
40:35
end of this series and what type of feeling do i want to leave the reader with
40:40
how how do i want to end this character story what do they need to overcome and just
40:47
how epic can i make it feel and how can i really drive home the emotion of all that they have been through so
40:53
that's something else that i think comes heavy into the planning part of it is really thinking about the character
40:59
arc and making sure that it feels satisfactory for a character people have been following
41:04
potentially for years i'm struggling with the second book in my first series
41:10
i feel like the second book struggle is common any tips so i think that there are a couple of
Why people struggle with their second book
41:17
reasons why people struggle with their second book first that first book is all about exploration it's fun
41:24
it's exciting you're getting into the story and a lot of the story is potentially introductory exploratory it's really fun
41:32
you're discovering the world just like your character is discovering it for the first time and so that carries a lot of the plot of
41:40
the book when you get into the second book though you have to start figuring out what is
41:45
this whole series about not just how do i introduce my readers to this world but
41:51
what is this all about what are the stakes what how does this going to tie in and build a bridge and it just naturally
41:58
starts to get harder especially with a dynamic series every single book gets a little bit harder because the content depends on
42:05
what you wrote previously and it starts to just build into this one huge story so my biggest tips for you are to really
42:12
sit down and start thinking not only about what happened in the first book but where you want to go not just what
42:19
is happening in book two but where am i taking this character in book three and four and a lot of times
42:25
that is going to spark some new ideas like oh i need to set this up i need to bring in this other new character and
42:32
it's going to start helping you put those pieces of the puzzle together because also another thing is depending on if
42:39
you've published that first book or not but sometimes we create that first book in a bubble
42:45
and we've got all this creative energy and we don't know if it's gonna sell and there's all this excitement but we're also like not receiving any
42:51
criticism we're not looking at sales numbers and judging ourselves it's just all potential at that point
42:58
but once you start moving toward publishing that first book that puts a whole new kind of pressure
43:03
on book two of wow now i've gotten reviews and some people didn't like this character they didn't like these
43:10
choices or i haven't sold as many books as i thought and it starts to add these doubts and so
43:15
my other big tip for you if you're struggling with book two is to try to
43:20
block out all of those doubts and put yourself back in the excitement that you had before you started publishing or before
43:27
you started getting feedback or started feeling like you were building something so big try to just loosen it up a little bit
43:33
and get back to the joy of writing instead of all the pressure of i'm writing a series and
43:40
take it one step at a time and just say i'm just writing this book and it doesn't have to be the best book ever
43:45
written it's just book two of a series and i'm gonna have super fun with it put yourself back in that place of
43:51
feeling when you first discovered this character or you first started thinking about this world
43:56
that's gonna help a lot so hopefully those tips i know that's just like the tip of the iceberg but i think
44:02
that pressure and the just the difficulty of how does this fit
44:08
in are probably the two main things that hold people back on book two so just take a deep breath try to get
44:16
yourself back in that joy space and let go of the pressure but also think ahead
44:21
where is this going and start getting yourself excited again about where this book 2 fits in the grand tapestry of this whole
44:27
series and see if that sparks some new and fresh excitement for the whole thing what's your preferred lead in a magnet a
Whats your preferred lead
44:35
prequel a 99 book one or a free book one so this is really
44:41
situational so i think a magnet is a great thing to use to get people onto your newsletter list so this is usually
44:47
something that is either a short story that's connected to your main series or
44:53
something that your current you know people that have loved your series but haven't quite signed up for your list so
44:58
that's a great way to lead people onto your list with a magnet i personally haven't used one yet but i do plan to write one for next year
45:05
prequel has not usually been my thing i find that especially if you're using it
45:12
as your magnet or the thing that pulls people in i find that prequels don't work really well
45:17
prequels usually are better for fan service so it's something that people that
45:22
already love your series they already love your world find really interesting to go back and see the before stuff
45:28
so after i finished book six of my main series i did kind of go back and write a
45:34
prequel story a story about jackson back in the shadow world and this is
45:39
more of like a fan service kind of thing not all of my readers pick it up but the die hard core
45:45
readers love it because they love seeing that sort of life of jackson before he came to the
45:51
human world and so i find that prequels are things to keep readers interest and to get them
45:56
deeper into the world but for me as a reader and as a writer i haven't found that to be a great lead in
Is 99 book 1 a great loss leader
46:03
99 book one is a great loss leader i don't think that 99 cents as a
46:09
permanent price works super well in today's market i think 99
46:14
works well as a pulse price a price that you do as a loss leader when you have a new
46:20
release to promote the whole series and for a limited period of time it can work great like that especially when you
46:26
only have two three four books in your series when it comes to being wide
46:31
and you're not in kindle unlimited and you've got starting to have five six books in your
46:36
series i like permafree and that is my preferred lead in and it is what i would use every
46:42
single time once i have five or six books in a series if i'm only doing a trilogy i don't know for sure that i would ever
46:49
do a permanently free book we're going to try it a little bit with my eternal sorrows series coming up and
46:55
i'm gonna experiment with that but in general when it's a trilogy or it's a shorter series or you only have three
47:03
or four books 99 works great as a temporary loss leader to promote a new release or to
47:09
promote the whole series but free is by far i think the most powerful thing
47:15
that you can use as an indie who is wide once you have four or five books plus in
47:20
your series now i will say it doesn't mean you have to use free i have several friends who've never had free
47:26
books and they utilize that kind of pulse pricing strategy with 99 cent books on book one
47:31
and it works great for them but for me personally free has changed my life and i love using free books as a huge
47:39
draw for my readers and it it works out as kind of an even exchange i give them a free book for
47:46
their free time and if they love it then they can continue on and buy and that has worked wonders for my
47:52
career but it's like i said there's no one path fits all is it okay to just put the first book
Is it okay to just put the first book free or on sale
47:58
free or on sale when you have a new release so that kind of piggybacks on the last question and this is actually the last question of
48:04
the series q a so yes it's totally fine to only set your book one free or on sale when you
48:12
have a new release and that actually is a really great strategy to bring in new readers when you have a new release later in the
48:18
series and i talk about this a lot in publish and thrive that it is really one of the most used
48:23
strategies by indie authors that when you have a new release you take book one of your series and you
48:30
either set it free or you set it to a sale price bring in new readers let your current
48:35
readers buy the new release and you're constantly feeding in new people to that new release and to
48:40
your whole series and that works out great and like i just said i don't find these days that 99
48:46
cents as a permanent price really brings in a ton of readers i've tried it with several things i currently still have one book at 99
48:53
cents kind of permanently and it's not at all doing what i had hoped it would do so i'm gonna probably raise those back
49:00
up to full price and try a different strategy but different genres are going to perform differently different types of
49:05
books will perform differently so i recommend that once you start your series you experiment with different
49:11
things and just keep in mind that some things are going to work better than others and some things will work better for you
49:17
than they do for other people and you'll see other people do things and it won't work for you
49:22
and that's just the way of being indie so be flexible be experimental and pay attention to
49:28
what works and what doesn't if it's working do more of it if it's not working stop doing it and i think that
49:36
the biggest challenge with free books is it's hard to pulse price free unless you're in kindle unlimited
49:42
because with kindle unlimited you can use like five free days for your 90 day uh term but when you're
49:50
wide you it's hard enough to get amazon to price match your book to free so to get them to shift it back to paid
49:56
and then back to free when you want can be a little bit of a headache doesn't mean you can't do it but it's something you need to plan for well in
50:02
advance because they won't always switch your book to free it's not like you can just manually switch your book at amazon
50:09
which makes it a little bit challenging the way you can do it other places so it's just something to keep in mind
50:15
when you're developing your strategy all right you guys that is all i have for our second and final series q a i sincerely hope

52:02
bye
52:11
[Music] you
hello everybody and welcome back to heart breathings i am excited to have our final official
0:06
video in the how to plan and write a series series of videos i sincerely hope
0:11
that you have enjoyed these and that you've gotten a lot of information out of them i had so many questions
0:17
though that we're gonna have to break this up into a two-part q a so today is going to be part one of the
0:23
q a and i will do part two of the q a next week if you have additional questions that you'd like to get
0:29
addressed go ahead and leave them in the comments of this video and if there's time left over in next week's q a
0:35
i will answer as many of those as possible too i will by popular demand also be adding an
0:41
extra kind of bonus video on the difference between a cereal and a series and some of the best
0:46
practices in publishing a cereal because many of you are interested in this and i do have some experience with
0:52
it with my cereal called sacrifice me so i'm going to talk about that in a future video coming up but this
0:58
actually is a fun q a that i've been looking forward to doing so grab a cup of coffee or whatever your
1:03
preferred beverage is tea or water and let's hang out for a little bit and talk about writing a
1:09
series and publishing as an indie author
1:16
okay so i have a bunch of questions here that came from the google form and from instagram and in every situation i
1:22
wasn't able to see who asked the question so i'm not going to name any names i'm just gonna ask the question in general
1:28
and do my best to answer it obviously i don't know everything and a lot of indie publishing or how to
1:35
write and how to do a series is really down to opinion so if something i say doesn't resonate with
1:41
you and you think well that's not right for me that's totally fine i completely believe that you should always follow your gut
1:47
instinct but my other warning for you here is while you should follow your own gut
1:53
instinct it's always important to double check your fear because a lot of times when we're afraid we refuse to listen to
2:01
really good advice and sometimes what you need to hear can be difficult to hear so i will come
2:08
to you with honest and authentic advice based on 10 years of writing and indie publishing and a lot of different
2:15
experience and a lot of book sales and i will just give you my best advice but it's totally okay if you disagree
2:21
and feel free to put your own beliefs and opinions in the comments as long as you're kind and respectful i
2:28
welcome any other discussion on these topics and let's just get started is it best to
2:34
publish a standalone romance series in chronological order i'm in edits on what i thought was book one
2:40
but it turns out two characters from book one are demanding their own stories which would make book one
2:45
into book three what do you think so i think when it comes to standalone romances it is
2:50
so much better if you have the books written in order if that character that you're thinking
2:56
of writing the one that was maybe a side character that now becomes a hero or heroine now gets their own book if they're
3:02
already hooked up you're gonna have to go back and tell their story before
3:08
they hook up so that the reader can be a part of that journey i feel like you're kind of cheating readers and a lot of
3:13
readers are going to feel cheated if they see heroin a with hero a
3:18
already together in book one and then in book three you go back and tell it as a backstory i think that that is going to
3:25
really kind of mess up the flow and one of the main things when you're writing a standalone series in romance that readers love is watching
3:33
the journey of how these characters got together sometimes it can be good like at the end
3:38
of a long series to go back and tell a previous story backstory of like oh here's the mom and dad and here's how
3:45
they fell in love that can be a good kind of side story but for the most part i think you're going to have better luck and better
3:51
readership in terms of satisfaction if you tell it in chronological order so if book
3:58
one now becomes book three that's fine just go back before you publish the book
4:03
you're already writing and write what is going to be truly book one of your series and start there because i think it's
4:10
just best if you start from the beginning and tell it chronologically unless there was some kind of
4:15
reason why you wanted to tell it out of order like secrets that you wanted to keep and that was part of the like framing device of the series
4:22
unless it's like imperative to the way you're telling the story it's gonna be better to tell it in
4:27
chronological order so a little bit more work for you before you can publish but yeah go back and write the real book one in
4:34
video number seven you said you switched from writing romance to writing y a fantasy how do you switch from one genre to
4:41
another without losing your fan base or did you just have to start all over from scratch so i'm sorry if this was confusing i
4:48
started out writing contemporary romance but i never published those books so the book that i wrote i submitted to
4:55
harlequin and it was rejected which actually turned out to be one of the best things that ever happened to me and then i started
5:01
writing y a fantasy the first book that i ever published was beautiful demons which is a why a
5:06
contemporary fantasy and that's where i started building my fan base now i did switch though
5:12
once i got all the way through book six of my why a series that was my most popular
5:18
and still is my most popular series i did switch to a couple different genres i published a
5:24
new adult contemporary romance series called the fair hope series completely different genre there's no
5:29
speculative elements there's no paranormal it's just emotional contemporary
5:35
romance and that was a definite switch i also switched a little bit when i
5:41
changed subgenres with nya and went from a why a contemporary fantasy witches type story to a why a
5:48
more like um dystopian apocal post-apocalyptic series with zombies
5:54
so you still have which elements in that series but it did switch sub-genres or niches there so i have
6:00
definitely played around with different genres now here's the thing this is one of
6:05
those things where i try to tell people as kindly and succinctly as possible
6:11
that the more you can stick with the same genre and even the same niche the better off you're going to be
6:17
in terms of building your fan base that is what i did for the first two full years of my career i concentrated not
6:24
only on one genre but also one series and that built up
6:29
over a hundred thousand sales for me and really got me started and developed a fan base when i switched
6:35
to new adult contemporary it was kind of like starting over because there were a lot of the fans of
6:40
my a fantasy that were just not interested in reading sex scenes or romance or
6:46
contemporary things they like the things that go bump in the night and they didn't want to read something
6:51
that was different and then i also had people that didn't want to read zombies they just wanted my shadow demon
6:56
saga or something witchy and like it so whenever you switch genres
7:02
you're always going to have people that are going to drop off one thing you need to understand about
7:07
indie publishing in general is that you're going to have people drop off it's not like you ever gain a
7:12
fan and they're a fan for life every single time you're always going to have an ebb and flow
7:17
but what you want to do as your primary job is to continue bringing in new readers
7:23
as well as keeping the readers that you have as much as possible when you switch from
7:28
one series to another even if they're in the exact same genre you are going to
7:34
potentially lose people the same is true for when you get six or seven books down the road in a series every
7:41
single new book you're gonna lose a few people so you want to always be bringing new people in but when you
7:47
totally switch genres that's when you're going to lose the most people and it will be kind of like starting
7:52
over so you need to keep that in mind especially those of you that are really multi-passionate and you
7:58
say well i'm going to write this y fantasy but i'm also going to write this mystery thriller and i'm going to start a pen name
8:03
in erotic romance and you want to do all of it all at once if you want to write multiple genres one
8:10
of the best things you can do for yourself is focus on a single genre a single series a single
8:15
niche until you've got some traction then once you've got a big fan base it gives
8:20
you a little bit more wiggle room in terms of how much you can afford at that point to
8:26
switch because you will have some people that will follow you over but it's pretty complicated and i just
8:33
think that you need to be prepared to start over almost every series you write as well as
8:39
every new genre my question is regarding advertising do you recommend amazon facebook or even
8:46
google advertising tools do you recommend local advertising like newspapers flyers etc
8:52
what advertising tools have served you best so advertising is tricky because
8:58
you could have five different best-selling authors and they could all have a completely different marketing strategy and this is something
9:05
that i could talk about for six or so hours which is why the marketing module of my publish and
9:10
thrive class is like an eight hour module because there's a lot of information that goes into it
9:15
the shortest answer is find the advertising tools that work for you
9:21
which for most indie authors is going to be either a mix or some kind of
9:26
diving into the following things facebook amazon and bookbub cpm
9:33
ads those are your kind of pay per click type advertising or on the other side of
9:39
it your newsletter or promo deal sites like book bub free booksie and other newsletters that
9:46
go out to readers who are looking for deals so those are kind of the two biggest ways to advertise your books and those
9:52
are the two most valuable ways to advertise your books as indies google ads or adsense has not been
9:59
successful for anyone i know and i have a lot of friends that have tried to make it work and i just haven't they haven't
10:05
seen any result that doesn't mean it won't work for you but just know that most authors have not had a lot of success with google
10:12
so if you're going to do those sort of pay-per-click ads it's amazon facebook and bookbub are the ones that work the
10:18
best when it comes to local advertising like newspaper and flyers and stuff like that
10:23
you're really going to see very little return for it i mean if you want to build a career for yourself
10:28
where you're going out and doing book signings at like state fairs or local like farmers
10:33
markets and stuff like that you can definitely build a little bit there but when you talk about like your
10:39
ebook audience and your audience on amazon you're talking about a global audience and you're building a potential readership of
10:46
millions when you're talking about your local farmer's market or whatever you might be talking about a local readership of like
10:52
50 to 100 people and i don't want to downplay that because that can be good but you're not going to be able to scale that
10:58
it's not like your local farmer's market is suddenly going to get you discovered in 99.9 so for most
11:06
indies i recommend you focus on those two types of online advertising which is the pay-per-click ads or the
11:12
deal site ads and that's where you're gonna get the most bang for your buck and the most progress
11:18
for your time can you please tell me more about emoting and tenses in writing so uh this is another i feel like a lot
11:25
of these questions are things that we could do like entire hour long or courses based on
11:30
but i will say this i don't really want to talk too much about emoting because i don't feel like i can talk succinctly
11:36
about that but i do have some things to say about pence and that is one of the best things that you can do
11:41
for yourself is once you've decided the kind of book like the niche or genre
11:47
genre that you are writing read a bunch of books in that genre and pay attention
11:52
to the tense that is used because you will typically find that each genre or even each little sub-genre
11:59
or niche will have its most commonly used tense and you will serve yourself very well if
12:05
you do what is most common because readers are used to reading that so if readers pick up
12:11
like a really dark new adult romance they're going to be expecting first person past tense or even first person
12:17
present tense and so if they get a third person past tense it might be kind of jarring for them
12:22
the same goes with the majority of young adult contemporary fantasy for example things
12:28
like the hunger games or divergent usually are going to be told in first person and if a reader picks up a book
12:34
like that and it's in third person they might be jarred by it alternatively if you pick up like an
12:41
epic fantasy and it's in first person that might be jarring for a reader who's used to
12:46
a more like omniscient third person tense so one of the best things you can do for
12:52
yourself is read widely in the genre that you intend to write and pay attention to what tense is being
12:58
used the most common tenses that you see in fiction are going to be first person past tense like i walked into the room
13:06
and he looked at me or third person past tense which is
13:11
she walked into the room and he looked at her or sometimes you will also see first person
13:17
present tense that's like i walk into the room and he looks at me so it's happening in the moment and
13:23
those are the three most common that you will see now whether it's close or far in third
13:28
person like omniscient like you might have with harry potter or it's really closely
13:34
written like my eternal sorrows series just depends on the genre once you find out and you've
13:40
decided what you're going to write read it and pay attention to what's being used and use what's normal or average in your
13:47
genre if you're writing a series is it advisable to draft the whole series or multiple books in rapid succession and
13:54
edit it one book at a time and have a faster release schedule like two to three months apart
13:59
i know a few that have done this and want to know your thoughts so i have an entire video on rapid release and whether you
14:05
should rapid release so i will link that for you down below to give you a little bit more information
14:10
on my thoughts on rapid release i think that it can be helpful i think there are also pitfalls when it comes to it and
14:16
it's going to come down to your process and your personality so not everyone first of all can afford to
14:23
write five books and then produce them all and release them very rapidly because for each book that you write
14:30
you've got editing costs cover art you know all of the things that go into promoting the books and
14:36
that sort of thing so if you don't have a lot of money up front you might need to publish your first and second books
14:42
and then use the proceeds from those books to pay for the next books and you might not have you know
14:48
five thousand dollars just ready to put in so that you can produce those five books so you need to look at it from a
14:54
practical stance as well as a marketing stance another thing is you know one of the
14:59
advantages to writing it that way is let's say you write the first three books
15:04
and then you go back and edit you can add a lot more foreshadowing and breadcrumbs and things
15:10
just to the first book so that it becomes a stronger lead-in to book two and then
15:16
book two can be a little stronger and then book three so it might actually help with the continuity of the series as
15:21
well as the readability of it and the excitement and what draws the reader to the next book
15:27
if you wrote them all in draft and then went back however it can be a trap too because i
15:33
have known people that have spent like a year writing the first three or four books and then when they go back to book one
15:39
their writing has changed and grown so much that then they spend the next year of their life
15:44
rewriting book one and trying to make it into what they want it to be another pitfall of doing this kind of
15:50
rapid release and re writing your whole series ahead of time is that you don't have any feedback
15:56
coming in so you write book one you write book two and so on and you don't actually know if
16:02
people like these characters if they like your writing if you're going to be successful with this particular series
16:08
you don't have any feedback whether good or bad so you don't have any encouragement you
16:13
don't have you're just kind of writing in your own vacuum and that can be harder than it seems
16:19
to just write your own stories and not have any kind of feedback for it because you're not getting the
16:24
satisfaction of good reviews and the momentum that's coming or income that's coming in what that can
16:29
often lead to is you get three books in and you suddenly don't even like your story
16:34
anymore you're not feeling any motivation you're not feeling any like you know draw and and need to go and
16:41
write it so you kind of get tired of your own characters and your own you know voice when it comes to it and
16:46
you don't have the fans waiting for the next book to kind of pressure you and convince you to write the next one
16:52
so that can be a pitfall that leads to this grand plan that you never really follow through on
16:58
so that's why i say it comes back to your personality and what you want to do but i do think that if you can come up with a
17:04
writing schedule that allows you to publish your books every two to three months it's going to help you sell books faster
17:10
and i've talked about this in several videos before that i will link for you down below sarah can you tell me your thoughts on
17:16
chapter length i've seen videos pretty much on the length of everything else but not actual chapters i've sort of been going
17:23
with the flow but i'm not sure what's the right way to do this so there is no standard right way
17:29
i have known some writers that say every chapter is four thousand words and this is how long it is i write
17:37
scenes so chapter one might be a two-page scene chapter two might be a ten page scene
17:43
and every chapter varies and i go based more on pacing and feel and flow of when i really need
17:50
a break i love personally in my type of genre and my style of writing
17:55
to go until it feels like a natural breaking point and sometimes i'm breaking it in the middle of a scene because it's kind of
18:02
a miniature cliffhanger and i love for every single scene i have or every chapter i have to end on what
18:09
they call a symbol crash where it's like dun dun dun you to turn that next page and i find that to be a really fun way
18:17
to write but your your style and the way you write might be different but just know
18:22
that in general there is no like every chapter needs to be 4 000 words i would say that another good thing that
18:30
you can do for yourself same thing i was talking about the tense is depending on what genre you decide
18:35
you're writing in go and pick up like 10 books by different authors in that genre
18:40
and pay attention is there a norm in terms of 10 pages per chapter every chapter has a
18:47
specific like if you're in a mystery every chapter is a different piece of the investigation or a different investigative like chunk
18:54
or a new clue is revealed in every chapter and start looking for those patterns because
19:00
you're going to learn more from those authors that have been doing it for a long time than you will from anything else so
19:08
i would not necessarily try to keep your chapters to a specific length more than the
19:14
chapter is as long as it needs to be but with that just saying that read what
19:19
is happening in your genre and try to pay attention to what the norms are
19:24
so that you can kind of fall into line but i think it would be a mistake to be like well every chapter needs to be 4
19:30
000 words so i'm going to stuff it with stuff that is not like really important to the book just so i can hit that word count
19:36
it's much much better idea to write what comes out naturally and make it
19:42
interesting than to worry about a word count how do i know what foreshadowing elements i should drop into my first
19:47
book especially if my books are one massively epic story also do i have to plot kinda the rest of
19:54
the series to determine the elements that should be left in the first one i hope this makes sense
20:00
so i did kind of discuss about my experience with this in some of the previous videos but i think
20:05
again it depends on how you want to do it if you are the type of person who can see that
20:12
far ahead and you kind of know where the story is going then it can only help you
20:17
to be able to write those elements in like little breadcrumbs throughout i however am not detailed in that way i
20:24
can see kind of this book and what's maybe coming up next but a lot of things just come out in the writing
20:30
so for example in book one of my shadow demon saga lark has some kind of tattoo we find out
20:37
in book two that that tattoo is a butterfly we don't find out until book six
20:43
the significance of that butterfly on her back however i didn't know it was going to be
20:49
significant in the way it was until i got to writing book six so you will find in my series lots of
20:55
little breadcrumbs that i put in intuitively but i didn't know how they would come full circle
21:00
and then they just sort of came together by the time i wrote the next book is this the best way to do it is it the
21:07
most efficient way i really don't think so i think the more far out you can plan
21:12
the better however that being said i have tried to plan further out and what
21:18
ends up happening is the story changes as i'm writing and then i just wasted all that time doing a bunch of pre-planning
21:24
that's no longer relevant so again i think the best advice i can give you is learn
21:30
what your process is try it both ways try planning it out and if you find that you're stuck for like
21:36
six months trying to figure out book six when you're still just on book two then just let it go just continue
21:43
writing book two let whatever comes come and try to figure out your own process because there is no like formula or this is the
21:49
right way to do it you don't have to have everything plotted out now when it comes to trying to decide what elements go into
21:57
book one it's going to be intuitive to some degree and i know that's probably a frustrating answer
22:02
but this is the way it is for me is you do the best you can and you know as you're writing that
22:08
there's going to be more to this story and as you begin to write elements in see what piques your interest
22:15
so for example when i started working on my book the witch's key i knew there would be a key but i didn't
22:20
have all the details figured out as to what would go on with those keys however my character as i'm writing she
22:27
sees another character that has a key that she's never seen before and it's got like a sapphire in and she's
22:33
thinking oh i wonder what that sapphire means but he quickly hides it that wasn't something that i intended or
22:39
planned it's just something that came through in the writing and now i can't remember if it actually is a sapphire or an emerald but i'll
22:45
figure it out before book two but that type of stuff sometimes as i know
22:51
i'm writing a big enough story i just let those elements kind of reveal themselves
22:57
but you may be the type of writer that needs to plan every single thing like that one of the main things you can do for
23:03
yourself though is as you're writing your rough draft and those little things come up like oh he's
23:08
got a key oh he said something about his mom i'm gonna need to bring that up again in book two oh we just found out about this shady
23:14
organization i'm gonna need to bring that up and figure out how it works in start making notes now this is where a
23:21
series bible can really help you or just at least a notebook where you can start writing down the what i would call breadcrumbs and
23:27
elements that you know are going to carry through and once you start writing it down and you've told your brain
23:33
these are going to be important the ideas will naturally start to come to you of like oh i know what i can do with that key
23:40
and sometimes those ideas will come when you least expect it my best advice to you is just work
23:45
through the process keep an eye on what elements might be important in future episodes and then as you get to the end
23:52
of this first book and you know it's this massively long story go ahead before you publish it and be
23:59
thinking what elements are in this story that are going to carry through and do i need you know what's going to happen in
24:05
book 2 and at least be thinking ahead to this next book and think is there anything i need to set up here
24:10
that isn't set up yet and then try to weave that in as long as you're working one book ahead
24:15
you're going to be okay but i know for myself now that i have more experience writing a longer series
24:22
that next time i want to think further ahead and i think it can only help you if you can do that
24:28
how do you name your series versus naming the individual books okay so um i try to make sure that the name
24:35
of the series and i highly recommend you do this too is as unique as possible individual
24:41
books it can start to get pretty difficult to name every single individual book something
24:47
different because as you know now that there are no longer publishers who are the only gatekeepers there are thousands
24:55
if not hundreds of thousands of indie books there may even be millions i don't know going on the market every year it's an
25:02
astronomical number of new books that are getting published and words are going to be reused
25:07
titles are going to be reused it's just the way it is and it's going to start to get really difficult to find a title
25:13
especially something like into the darkness or lost in the night you know or whatever
25:19
that is not used already so one thing that i would recommend to you is to come up with a
25:25
series title that is unique this can mean like if you're writing a mystery that your character's name is unique and therefore
25:32
you name it after your character like the sookie stack house series with um with charlene harris
25:38
that is a unique series name because it is her character name and jack reacher for
25:45
example or you know some of those other types of books like they based on the character name that can really work um
25:52
harry potter and so on try to make your series title as unique as possible sometimes
25:58
you will see people name their whole series after book one so for example my series
26:03
the first book is called beautiful demons i could have just called it the beautiful demon series and that would have been fine too
26:09
so you can go either way with it when it comes to naming conventions though i highly
26:15
recommend that each individual book of your series seem like it's a part of the overall
26:21
brand so sorry to use my own example again but it's the best way to do it for me
26:26
beautiful demons inner demons bitter demons shadow demons and i use that recurring word
26:32
each time um carly phillips who i love she's an amazing romance author she has
26:37
a dare series and each book has the word dare dare to love dare to blah blah blah and
26:43
so on so you find like that recurring word or that recurring theme
26:48
that you can bring back up each time or for example another really good friend of mine is danica
26:54
dark and she has a series that is called the seven series or whatever so it's
27:00
seven years six months the next book is five weeks and then four days and so on so i don't that might not be
27:07
exactly how it goes but it's something like that and so she's got this kind of what i
27:12
call a naming convention something that readers can see oh this is the seven series and this
27:17
is book five because it's got a big five on it and it's called five weeks you know or whatever so you've got that naming convention so
27:24
just sit down with yourself and think okay i want to come up with a unique series title and then i want all the books to seem
27:30
like they match each other in some way even if every single title isn't necessarily the most like
27:36
unique title of all time it's good to try your best to be unique with the series title and
27:43
then brand those individual book titles so they all seem to match in some way
27:48
what are some bonus content ideas that series have especially fantasy or sci-fi genres like
27:55
character designs maps and etc how do you feel about those being included
28:00
so this is really kind of cool i think that when it comes to fantasy in particular you definitely
28:05
might have um like maps if you had a science fiction like alien type series you might have
28:12
like images or drawings done of what the different creatures look like or the like schematics of the ship or
28:20
something that tells you like all the different stars in the galaxy or whatever like that and i think those
28:25
types of bonus materials can be amazing another type of common bonus material that you might find is like
28:32
recipes or playlists that match the songs that you might have been listening to or something that reminds
28:38
you of the characters sometimes it can just be like a character interview like you're the author interviewing the characters
28:45
um so you can find lots of things like that if you go looking for it so sometimes you've got stuff like posters or swag that's bonus
28:53
and sometimes in the book itself you'll have a map of the world or you'll have for example at the end of
28:59
the wheel of time every single time he has a list of some of the like main characters that you've
29:04
met because it's this huge fantasy world you know he's kind of reminding you it's sort of like a dictionary in the back of
29:11
the book that says you know this land okay and it tells you a little bit about the land and the people that come from it
29:17
and it'll kind of give you an idea of the pronunciation and those kinds of things and i think that
29:22
depending on the type of book you're writing that stuff can all help immerse your reader in the world
29:27
and anytime you can immerse your reader even more into that world as if they feel like they're a part of it
29:33
you're doing really good things then some of that stuff becomes really good bonus like giveaways and things so let's
29:40
say you have a amazing new fantasy series coming out and you had a map
29:45
professionally drawn by an artist you could include that map in the book itself but you could also
29:52
have a big poster of that map and get it framed and sell those on your website signed
29:58
and have people pay you know however much money for this special edition signed poster of the map of the land
30:07
and that is just going to help people be like oh i want to be a part of this world so you could be thinking about some of
30:12
those things you could also do something unique like having some kind of screen saver
30:18
made of the map and for everyone who pre-orders the book you they send you a receipt you send
30:24
them a desktop wallpaper of that map so you can get really interesting um results or you can do
30:31
really fun and innovative things with those sorts of extras i know maps is one
30:36
that you'll see most commonly but with other types of series like i said you might see recipes
30:41
you might see playlists you might see bonus like character sketches or fan art
30:48
or things that go along with it but yeah i think that you kind of touched on some of those that are the
30:54
main ones and not only can it get readers talking but it can also give you something else
30:59
to keep sharing so that you're immersing people in the world and i think it's a great idea to do that but i just wouldn't put
31:05
a ton of money into it until you're making money because i think it's another one of those places where you could get lost and you could spend
31:11
thousands of dollars getting character mock-ups and maps and all this stuff and i don't think in the end it's going
31:17
to help you sell like a ton more books it's just going to be something fun that helps you build community
31:23
but it's probably not going to show through a lot in your actual sales and income so use
31:29
it as a bonus thing but don't spend a ton of money on it until you've already got that community going
31:35
and you know that money's coming back to you how far in advance for a character's arc do you need to know as you're writing
31:41
your first book thanks okay so this kind of goes back to that same question before about how many
31:46
elements so for your character's arc i do think if you've got a dynamic series where
31:52
you're going to be writing a long series about this one particular character i think it's good to know where this
31:58
character is headed who are they at the beginning of the series and who are they going to have to evolve
32:04
into as far out as you can see i didn't know when i first started writing harper that
32:09
she was going to be the heroine for 12 full books so i didn't plan and map out her character arc for 12
32:15
books it sort of began to happen naturally as an arc but i did think ahead to those first six books once i
32:21
got a couple books in i was like okay i know she's gonna be fighting this one big bad
32:26
and this is what we're all leading up to and so i planned out her character arc maybe three or four books in advance and
32:33
i think that that can help you i don't think you need to know the entire series the whole thing
32:38
but it's important to identify right from the beginning what is her wound what is the what are
32:45
the things that are holding her back how is she holding herself back what's this lie that she tells herself
32:50
and how much is she going to overcome in this first book how much does the reader need to see her overcome
32:56
so that she can progress to the next book because readers are going to want to see some growth but you can't give them all the growth
33:03
in one book it needs to kind of be meted out book by book so i think it's a good idea to be thinking
33:09
okay i can identify these things of where she is now and i know what she's going to need to grow into over the course of multiple
33:16
books i don't think you necessarily need to say in book one she does this in book two she does this
33:22
unless that works for you but i think you do need to be thinking at least two or three books ahead
33:27
about where her character or his character is going to do go and how much they'll grow in these first few books what is your recommended
33:34
pricing for different lengths and book launch budgets okay so this is another thing
33:40
that is really difficult to talk about in a short q a but i would say
33:45
that pricing sometimes can be related to book length but not always
33:50
and it can be more related to the type of genre that you're writing and it can be related to
33:55
is this book one in the series and you're using it as a loss leader or is it you know book five in a series
34:02
because you can get away with a higher price the deeper you are in a series because people are already
34:07
invested and they know they're getting a certain type of quality book and they're willing to spend money on it
34:13
for your first book though you're using that as kind of a hook to get new readers in or a magnet to get
34:20
new readers in and you're using it as what is called a loss leader usually where you're willing to give that book
34:26
up for a lower price to kind of entice readers in because at that point readers don't necessarily
34:32
know if you're writing great quality or not that being said if you're writing short
34:37
stories typically for you know a three to ten thousand word short story
34:43
the most you're going to be able to get away with is 299. even that is a stretch though most
34:49
readers are going to be upset to get only 5 000 words for 2.99 with the exception
34:54
of a genre like erotic romance with erotic romance you can charge higher prices for shorter it
35:00
works because there's a specific desire and outcome that's looked at for those
35:06
books whereas when you're just telling a story that doesn't include erotic fiction you're looking at 99
35:12
cents or a dollar 99 for those shorter stories and then you can box them up like three or four stories in
35:18
an anthology that you charge 2 or 3.99 for and that's typically what you'll see for
35:23
novella length fiction where you're talking about like 15 to 30 000 words or a little bit above that
35:29
you're probably looking at 299 kind of as your higher end price point
35:35
and anything below so some readers would love to see a novella at only 99 cents
35:40
but they're willing to pay 299 for it when you go into full length novel categories
35:45
so you're talking about 35 to 40 000 words all the way up to you know 100 000 words
35:51
or more it kind of all the same rules apply 299 is a common price that you'll see for
35:57
indie books especially for authors that are not as established newer authors that readers are taking a
36:02
chance on first books in a series second books in a series as you get more established and
36:08
your books become more well-known or you're deeper in a series most indies will price their books at 3
36:14
to 5.99 you won't see a lot of indies pricing their books higher than 5.99
36:20
regardless of price so even if your book is 185 000 words you can't usually get away
36:26
with charging 8.99 for it as an indie because most people don't care so much about how long the book is
36:33
they care how much the book costs so for the most part i would base your costs on
36:38
those kinds of parameters and then the actual like full-length books in your series
36:43
come up with a price that feels good for you and then experiment the good thing is whenever you price
36:48
your book you can always change it but for my books that are usually like
36:54
deeper in a series my books go anywhere from 75 000 words to 120 000
37:00
words and they're typically 3.99 i probably could bump those up to 4.99
37:05
and make a little bit more money but i also like to keep my books uh easily accessible to readers so 3.99
37:12
has kind of been my price point but i think you can go anywhere from that 299 to 599 and be in the right range
37:19
there for a full length novel so jule asked can you show us how you work with your pdfs on screen with an
37:25
example and i'm sorry to say that i can't do that in this particular thing but if you're interested in seeing some
37:31
of the pdfs i do actually do walkthroughs for many of my pdfs i have my
37:37
writing schedule pdf has a walk through my hb 90 stuff has walkthroughs on how i
37:42
plan my days my um how to plot a novel how to edit a novel i've taken you guys through
37:48
exactly how i use those with examples so if you're interested in seeing the majority of how i use those pdfs
37:55
you're gonna have to look through the actual videos that discuss those particular freebies
38:00
and find them but they are there most of them are there and i will link as many of them down below as i can
38:06
but i haven't stepped through all of the like writing word count tracker so i probably will do a little bit more of
38:11
that when i provide some things for october preptober coming up next month but most of those walkthroughs for my
38:19
pdfs are available in my previous videos how much money can a person expect to spend being an indie publisher on
38:26
average compared to traditional publishing okay so i can give you a range but i can't give you an
38:32
exact number because everybody's going to spend a different amount of money the main things that you're going to
38:38
need to spend money on are your editing which can include developmental editing copy
38:45
editing and proofreading all three or any of the three then you're probably going to need to
38:51
spend money on cover art which is something most of us can't do ourselves and you're going to need to spend money
38:58
on marketing when you're first getting set up you're also probably gonna have some upfront expenses to get a website
39:04
running and maybe some author branding or some images or something like that for promo
39:10
so those are kind of the main areas that you're going to spend money but how much you spend is really going to depend on your
39:16
personal budget and what you're willing to put into it so i'll just quickly break down these different things when it comes to
39:22
your editing for a developmental editor you're going to be looking probably at a minimum
39:28
of 400 at minimum and it could go all the way up to 3 000. so this is why i say there's no exact
39:34
number but if you need to use a developmental editor where they're going to be telling you ways to fix plot holes
39:40
and actually looking at the overall plot of your story you can expect to spend on the low end four hundred dollars but
39:47
for the most part maybe more like seven hundred dollars on average if you need a copy editor or
39:53
a line editor who's going to go through your book line by line and help you with sentence structure and style and formatting
40:00
they usually are not going to help you with too much of the like overall plot of your story but they will help
40:06
you with the consistency and the style and of course your grammar that you're going to
40:12
probably on average spend between two hundred and two thousand dollars two hundred and
40:18
two thousand dollars so again there's a huge range depending on the experience of your editor
40:24
how quickly they work how much like education they have how good they are to some degree even
40:30
though you will find some newer editors that will charge less money for this i think on average
40:36
my copy editing ends up costing about four to five hundred dollars for copy edits then
40:41
when it comes to proofreading you can find anywhere from maybe fifty dollars up to three hundred
40:48
dollars for a proofread is kind of the average cost when it comes to your editing i highly
40:53
recommend that at the very minimum you get a proofreader in there but some proofreaders are not even going
40:58
to look at your book if it's not well already like well formatted and has a good grasp of
41:05
grammar because a proofreader is usually just that final read through to catch little typos and things like that
41:11
so if your story needs a lot of work you're not going to be able to just use a proofreader okay so let's say on average if you're
41:17
using a proper amount of editing you're kind of looking at a minimum of 500 to a thousand dollars on your edits
41:24
when it comes to your cover art again you're looking at probably a minimum of 50 to 75 dollars if you use a pre-made
41:31
cover or you're using cover art that isn't super custom like just an image with some
41:36
typography written on it if you are using a custom cover like for
41:41
example my covers usually cost about five to six hundred dollars that is much more custom
41:47
it takes a lot of skill and photoshop knowledge to be able to paint these covers so it just takes a little bit
41:53
more work or a lot more work but i have also known author friends who have done an
41:59
entire custom photo shoot with models that aren't coming from stock photos and they have spent about three thousand
42:05
dollars per cover so there is a really big spread of what you can spend i would
42:10
never recommend to any just beginning brand new indie author to spend three
42:15
thousand dollars on a cover shoot and all that because it's going to take you so long to earn your money back
42:21
that you're going to have a struggle to produce more than one book something to keep in
42:26
mind as an indie publisher is that you want to have a pretty good budget to be able to
42:33
produce three to five books before you need to be making a ton of money back from it if you only have the money to produce
42:39
one book and you've got to wait until that book makes enough profit to pay for book two
42:45
you're already going to be potentially in a really tough spot so if you're going to be tight on budget
42:51
then i would go as tight on budget as possible to get decent stuff for your book like
42:57
you've got to balance it so if you can only afford a proofreader then i would try to find
43:02
beta readers or friends that will go through your book with a fine tooth comb so that that proofreader can get a hold
43:09
of your book and really polish it and then you only spent maybe 150 on that final proofread
43:15
then you can find a really good cover art that has you know everything you need but it
43:20
might not be as custom but it's a pre-made and it only cost you 75 dollars so get started as much as you can on a
43:27
shoestring budget and then once you've started making money back after maybe three or four
43:32
books and you start seeing money start to flow in then you can go back and you can rebrand those covers or even have your books
43:39
re-edited which is something that i did it's always a balance because you do need to have enough money
43:44
and keep your expenses low enough to be able to produce that next book because your best thing you can do is that next
43:50
book so again let's say you by now you've got your edits done and your cover art and you've spent
43:56
about six hundred and fifty dollars then you've gotta think about marketing i don't necessarily recommend that you
44:02
do a ton of marketing on your first book in a series but by the time the second book comes out you might want to be spending a
44:08
little bit of money advertising that first book as a lost leader and again of course i go into this in
44:15
detail in my publish and thrive course but long story short is just that one of the best practices you can follow is
44:22
when book 2 of your series comes out at full price you drop book 1 to 99 cents
44:27
and you put some of those ads toward it it can be any of those like pay per click ads or the promo deal site ads
44:33
but you get a little bit of ads for your budget and bring new readers into that first series
44:38
and hope that those readers go from book one to book two if you've done your job and written a good
44:44
book then you start making money on the full price of book two then you raise that price back up and
44:50
when you release book three you put a little bit more money into promotions so with each book release you're gonna
44:56
need a little bit of a budget at least a hundred dollars to start advertising your book
45:01
so i would say on average indies are going to spend between 700 and 3 000
45:08
per book every book you release there are ways to do it on a more shoestring budget so if you're interested in
45:15
editing on a budget and things like that go back and watch my videos on how to edit your novel and of course pre-made covers where you
45:22
have an artist that has made a bunch of covers that are not really custom and then they add your book title to it
45:29
that's the best way to get decent cover art for really cheap the trick with pre-mades
45:34
however is if you're not buying an entire series you might get that first book pretty cheap but in order to make
45:40
sure that second book is well branded to your whole series you're gonna have to pay for a custom cover for book two so it
45:46
kind of all evens out when it comes to traditional publishing however you shouldn't really be needing to spend
45:52
any money your publisher should pay for your editing your publisher should pay for your cover art and that sort of thing
45:58
the main things that you'd have to pay for as a traditional publisher are like if you want to spend some money on your
46:03
website or you want to get your branding done or that sort of thing then you're going to need to put a
46:09
little bit of money up front for those sort of things and a website like hosting might cost you for
46:14
the whole year 250 dollars for the year if you have someone design your whole website like you're not just using a
46:20
wordpress template and you have someone design your site that can be anywhere from a thousand dollars to ten thousand dollars
46:26
depending on how much you want to spend but you could do a website for free just on um like google blog spot or
46:34
something like that and maybe spend 12 on a domain name that you can make look good so there are lots of ways to do it
46:40
so if you guys want to see some advanced videos on how to publish on a budget or what average costs are
46:47
for indie publishers and how to bring those costs down when you're first getting started let me know in the comments and i will put
46:53
together a video like that for you indie publishing is considerably more expensive than traditional publishing
46:59
but the return is also considerably higher so whereas an author who's traditionally publishing
47:05
might be making less than 20 royalty on their ebooks and less than seven percent on their paperback books
47:13
you as an indie are going to be making 70 it's a lot more return
47:19
so you can sell less books at a lower price and make more money than someone who is
47:25
traditional traditionally publishing the other thing is you have complete control over your marketing so you can
47:32
market the books and make more money than a traditional author who doesn't have any control over
47:38
what's done to market their books okay so that concludes the first half of our q a i have an entire second page
47:45
which will probably also take about an hour so if you're interested in tuning into that that will be up
47:51
next week also let me know in the comments if you have any other questions for me and i will be in the meantime preparing
47:58
for preptober coming up in october i'm going to have some free downloads for you and some advice on how to win nanowrimo how
48:04
to write faster and how to be consistent and i'm also going to have a video coming up for you about how
48:11
to write a serial versus a series and that will be a bonus video that will be coming up in a couple of weeks
48:17

48:41
guys in my next one [Music]
48:46
bye [Music]
49:01
you [Music]
hello and welcome to our preptober planner walkthrough I'm so excited for
0:06
Nano this year and from the comments of Thursday's video I think many of you are also really excited for this so I've got
0:13
together all my kind of spooky things how cute is this skeletal hand once I'm done with this walkthrough I'm actually
0:19
going to take some time to set up my October planner but you can feel free to
0:25
theme your preptober planner according to the genre that you're writing or you can just make it fun and cute or you can
0:30
go very minimal anything works I'm personally going to kind of theme it and use some haunted house type washi tape
0:37
even though I'm not 100 certain which story I'm gonna write so if you want to hear what I'm working on definitely head
0:43
back to Thursday's video where I talk about how I'm kind of in between I'm trying to finish a project in October
0:49
but we'll see what I end up working on and I'll kind of talk about that some throughout this preptober planner now
0:55
when it comes to success in nanowrimo I have been doing this for more than a
1:01
dozen years and I've only won about half the time so it's really let me tell you
1:06
this like I know people say it but truly so you can believe it from a nano veteran it's not about whether you hit
1:13
the 50 000 words it's such a huge accomplishment and it's something to be proud of and it's something to aim for
1:18
if you're in a place right now where you feel excited to aim for 50k but you can
1:23
still get the community the camaraderie the fun the motivation the energy of
1:30
Nano even if you set a 10 000 word goal so I know that's not conventional most people say oh it's got to be the 50k you
1:36
know but the truth is you can still go to the write-ins my friend and Ness on our previous uh video she posted that
1:43
she's just gonna be a nano cheerleader this year which means she's going to go to the write-in she's going to hang out in the community but she's not
1:49
necessarily going to be trying to go for 50k so if you feel like you're not in a place right now where you want to push
1:55
yourself or you know that you're not going to have time or you've got other things going on and you really need the
2:00
flexibility of being able to take a day off if you need it then just hang out with us and write
2:06
what you can and make for progress and celebrate every word but don't push yourself and press yourself because this
2:12
is not meant to cause extreme anxiety it's meant to be fun and to get you writing and so that's the way I always
2:18
look that's why I look forward to it so if you're feeling anxiety then just release the pressure of it's got to be
2:24
50k and just set your own goal or tell yourself you're just going to do your best I have definitely found the years
2:32
that I have won Nano it's really come down to how much good prep I did ahead
2:38
of time so that's part of what I'm here to help you do but I always want you to keep in mind that if you feel like
2:43
you're not in a place to do this and this stresses you out it doesn't mean that you're excluded from participating
2:49
be a nano cheerleader like an S so I have a bunch of stuff here that I you
2:55
don't have to use any of these things and in fact you don't even have to have this preptober planner but if you're looking at it and you're thinking oh I
3:01
want one of those I made this for you totally free just to help you get through Nano and you can grab this on my
3:07
newsletter list if you join my newsletter I will have a link to a form down below that you can fill out and you
3:13
get access not only to this preptober planner but also to my how to Plot a novel how to write a series how to edit
3:19
your novel how to use index cards and scene cards to create scenes like so
3:25
many good resources more than maybe a couple dozen so definitely check that
3:30
out you get it all for free so come join us on my list I'm gonna try not to set
3:36
anything on fire but I just really wanted to have that this beautiful pumpkin was a gift from Kate in my
3:43
mailbox last week along with this super cool Spooktacular mug which if you don't
3:49
know for my Sarah Cannon fans I do an event every October called the
3:54
Spooktacular so this was a very cool gift thank you Kate for that and so I
4:00
decided to use it in my little decor here I also have with me this is one of my newest like fun gadgets that I've
4:06
gotten from Amazon this is a like you know you've got the mechanical keyboards this is a mechanical calculator and it's
4:12
not as functional as using your phone but I like the way it clicks so I've got that here as well so let me walk you
4:18
through this planner because we're gonna be here for a little bit so a little bit of a quote here you can't wait for
4:24
inspiration you have to go after it with a club I decided to put this one because not only did it make me laugh as a Jack
4:29
London quote but also because it it can be so true I feel like for the past
4:34
couple of years I have been pretty stressed and pretty much going at my max
4:40
speed and I've been thinking eventually the inspiration will come and now over the past couple months I've been
4:46
thinking I cannot wait any longer I have to go after it and so this quote really meant something to me so hopefully you
4:53
will like it as well I have some tips here for you a little letter there at the front of the planner and then we
4:58
Dive Right into a checklist so this is your Nano noveling checklist and
Preptober Checklist
5:04
basically it walks you through you don't have to do all these things but it walks you through some of the things you might
5:09
want to think about before you start Nano so we're going to be looking at our time we're going to do that pretty soon we're going to look at how like what's
5:16
your word goals so we're going to walk through this part we're going to create a plan and talk about rewards and then
5:21
meals and snacks so this is a lot of what we're going to be doing over the preptober videos coming up then tools
5:28
what tools do you want to use because let me tell you if you have no decisions
5:34
to make when it comes to November 1st and you already have all this figured out you're going to be able to use all of your brain power on the decisions
5:40
that you're making for your novel so make these decisions ahead of time where are you going to write what tools are
5:46
you going to use are you going to use the laptop are you writing in scrivener are you using plotter what tools so this
5:51
is tools like highlighters colored pins if you're going to color code your points of view which we'll talk about in
5:58
a later video which colors are you going to use like all of these decisions Visions take brain power right executive
6:04
function and so the more decisions you can make ahead of time the better software and computer so for me I know
6:10
I'm going to be using my Alpha smart and I'm mostly going to be writing on my laptop and my Alpha smart those are the
6:17
two main that I'm planning to use but it might switch up as I start thinking through this I also know that I'm going
6:22
to be writing in Google Docs again so I've already got everything set up for that Health prep your health so we're going
6:30
to talk about prepping your space so this is going to be about making sure that you've got a plan for drinking water keeping yourself hydrated getting
6:37
up and moving around so we'll talk about that more any extra tools that you might need like a nice pair of headphones A
6:42
new mouse a pad for your wrist in case you've got some carpal tunnel stuff going on nice notebook so what kind of
6:49
other tools then prep your writing crew so nanowrimo website of course is
6:54
nanowrimo.org and there are forums there and when you go you can search for your home region which means I am new to the
7:01
Dallas area so I'm going to be pretty soon probably this weekend going and looking at the Dallas Area writers in
7:08
Nano and reaching out and introducing myself and it can be a little bit nerve-wracking I know to introduce
7:13
yourself but there are going to be write-ins happening some of them are going to be virtual where you can meet people on Discord or on Twitter and
7:19
stuff like that and some of them are going to be in person and this is a really great way this is how I have met
7:25
some of my very very best writing friends like Jen and Erica elope some of my favorite people and I would just I
7:33
would have hated to miss out on those friendships so it's really fun and people tend to be very welcoming and
7:39
it's nothing to be scared of you show up at a coffee shop there'll be a few people there sometimes there'll be 20 people there and you just get to know
7:46
some new friends and it's awesome so think about that then writing groups like Discord so I have a Discord server
7:53
called Sarah Cannon's coven I will leave a link to it down below we have writing Sprints and we have a Hardee's hangout so this is for fans of my books but also
8:00
if you want to come right with us come join us over there then the best very best is the heartbreakings writing
8:07
community I've talked about our group before this is about 5 000 writers we have a
8:13
Facebook group and we also have I think 10 or more admins at this point that are
8:19
doing writing Sprints throughout the week and there's going to be extra Sprints extra events going on for November and we even have a virtual
8:26
writing Retreat coming up on the 14th I think it is 14th 15th 16th of October whatever that Friday Saturday Sunday is
8:32
and it's just amazing because we Sprint on YouTube and in Facebook so you can join us either way if you're not on
8:38
Facebook come join us on YouTube and there's just something about having that timer and knowing there's 20 other
8:43
people who are sprinting with you so come join that group I will leave a link to that down below as well then prepping
8:50
your novel so this is all of the stuff that we're going to talk about in next video and on Thursday so this is your
8:57
outline your color coding your character sheets Your World building your research all of that stuff as much of that as you
9:03
can have done before November the better if you are a plotter so what do you do if you're a pantser we're going to talk
9:08
about that on Thursday prepping your space again we're going to have a video on this as well but you might want to start thinking about
9:15
what kind of desk if you don't have a space that's yours in your home or your
9:21
apartment can you carve out a space on the couch or on the kitchen table and we're gonna I'm gonna give you some solutions for that ergonomics so you
9:28
want to make sure that you're taking care of your body and your health so you want to make sure that you have a nice
9:33
chair or you have a nice back pillow or you know things like that and then we're
9:38
going to talk about inspiration like quotes on your wall your favorite author's photo the book cover like
9:44
mock-up stuff like that and then the vibe you know we've got candles you've got potentially lighting music Ambiance
9:51
channels so we've got lots more info coming on that as we go through preptober together
NaNoWriMo Calendar
9:57
then this is something that we do every year if you're new to the preptober planner this might be worth its weight
10:04
in gold for you so I have for you here a November calendar and this is of course
10:10
for me where I would take out my washi tape and decorate all of this page here so if you're a Monday start person feel
10:17
free to use a different calendar but I only made one this year but there are five steps I want you to follow and the
10:23
point of doing this exercise is to really take a realistic look at your time so instead of thinking oh I've got
10:30
30 days you need to look and see if you have any other commitments going on in the month of October that are going to
10:36
keep you from writing because what might happen is if you think you have 30 days and you think you have to write 1667 a
10:43
day to hit 50k and then you end up with something on this Saturday you're not going to write on Thanksgiving and then
10:49
these last two days you've got a birthday thing going on you're going to find that your four full days behind and
10:55
you should have been writing more on these other days and so it's good to get an idea of what your true daily word
11:01
count goal is going to be so here's the process that I follow but of course I am going to put some washi
11:07
tape on here [Music]
11:25
just just a little bit of decoration makes me feel happy so this Washi tapes
11:32
from Simply gilded these little bats are from honeybee shop so now what we're
11:38
going to do is we're going to really take a look so step one mark off any days this month when you won't be able
11:44
to write now for me because I'm doing nanowrimo Diaries I'm going to try my
11:50
best to write every day because it's boring when I don't write but we're gonna
11:56
try to be realistic here the third through the sixth
12:01
I will be speaking at romance author Mastermind so I'm going to be driving to Houston and I'm going to be meeting up
12:07
with lots of friends and there's going to be a lot of things to do so I am just
12:13
going to assume that I'm not going to be doing a lot of writing on those days maybe I would be able to write when I
12:19
get home Sunday but it's very unlikely so this is something I always talk about
12:25
in my hb90 course as well that it's important to look at this type of
12:30
schedule when you're trying to be realistic and not think about the you you wish you were but rather that you
12:35
you are and just take yourself as you are no judgment understand your own
12:41
limitations and mindset if you are the type of person who goes away to a
12:46
conference and also gets up in the morning or stays up late to write then great you always do it so you're probably going to do it again if you
12:53
know you're you don't usually do it please do yourself a favor and just assume you're also not going to do it
12:59
this time because where I used to mess up is I would say well I don't usually do it but this time I'm really going to
13:04
do it and then I would be four days behind so just plan for the you that you currently are instead of planning for
13:10
yourself to change overnight so I've got those four days that I'll be at romance
13:16
author Mastermind I probably will also not be writing on Thanksgiving Day and
13:23
ah Black Friday I do like to do shopping and I haven't been able to do it the last couple of years so I'm going to
13:28
Mark both of those days off so that's the first thing you mark off the days you don't think you'll be writing
13:35
next choose whether or not you want to add in any buffer days so buffer days are basically like if you usually have a
13:43
really tough time with migraines or you know that you struggle with the anxiety and depression and you probably need a
13:50
day off a week to sleep in or to do a little bit of self-care go ahead and
13:55
count those days off as well so if you want to add in buffer days it doesn't matter really where you want to do that
14:02
but if so how many you can just write it over here let's say for me I'm going to give myself two buffer days in addition
14:08
to these other days off so now you're going to tally up your total days off and subtract this from 30 days so we're
14:16
going to say one two three four five six days off plus these two so six plus two
14:22
now I don't need my calculator to do that but listen how cute it is so that's eight days off so we're gonna
14:29
take 30 days minus eight and that gives us 22. so down here where it says total
14:36
writing days this month that's where I'm going to give myself a 22. so instead of 30 days to write I have 22 days to write
14:43
then you can go ahead and put in here what's your word count goal so for me I'm just going to put in the
14:49
50k I'm not trying to go crazy and do over I know some of you will try to be doing 75 or 100K so more power to you
14:56
I'm going for the 50k so 50k and then 22 days so the way that you get this is you
15:04
say divide 50 000 words so we take 50 000 words or whatever your goal is so if
15:09
you had a goal of 75 000 words you would put 75 000 words here and then divide
15:14
that by the number of days so 50 000 divided by 22 days gives me
15:22
2272.72 so what I'm gonna give myself here in my daily word count Target is
15:29
I'm going to say 20 to 73 because I'm going to round that 0.7 up to 3. so my
15:36
daily word count Target is not the average Nano word count Target of 1667 because if I hit 1667 a day which seems
15:45
like it would be a winning number but I don't only write 22 days then I'm going to end up with 36 674 and I'm going to
15:52
be 13 400 or so short of my goal so that's why this is important to really
15:58
take your time into consideration because you may not have as much time as you think which means you need to beef up those extra days then we're going to
16:05
use these word count sheets to create your writing plan so once you have this
16:11
daily word count Target turn to well the next page first of all
16:17
really this should have been probably later in the thing so I kind of have these out of order but this is kind of a
16:24
game board so we'll come back to that in just a minute but what I want you to go to is the
16:29
nanowrimo Sprint calculator so this is where we're going to do some nanowrimo math and feel free to read all of this
Sprint Calculator
16:36
you know before but one thing that can be super helpful for you and if you've never done this before I have an entire
16:43
five-day challenge that you might want to take to figure out your sweet spot when it comes to writing Sprints now
16:49
maybe you don't write in Sprints but let me explain what that is so a writing Sprint is when you set a timer for like
16:55
15 minutes or 25 minutes and you do nothing else but right so you set a
17:01
timer you start writing you write for 15 minutes with no distractions when the timer goes off you calculate how many
17:06
words you wrote and then you take a break and then you come back the heartbreakings writing Community is based on these writing Sprints and I
17:13
first learned to do them through nanowrimo because that's a big way that the write-ins tend to run is through
17:19
writing Sprints and this is based also on the Pomodoro method which is also part of what I do in hb90 so my life
17:25
runs on Sprints I love of it if you don't go well on Sprints then you could say your average word count per hour if
17:31
you want to do that instead because I know not everybody does sprints if you want to figure out what your
17:37
ideal sprinting time is so for some people 10 minute Sprints are ideal for some people 30 minutes prints are ideal
17:43
there is a challenge in my resource library that free resource library that takes you through five days of
17:50
experimenting to see what your favorite is mine tends to be either 20 or 25 minutes so I tend to go with 25 during
17:57
Nano and then take a five minute break which gives me 30 minute chunks of time so once you get used to it you will
18:04
figure out what is your average word count per Sprint so could be per hour or
18:10
could be per Sprint for me my average word count right now it used to be 850
18:16
but right now lately it's been 650 so every 25 minutes I write about 650 words
18:23
then what you can do is you can figure out your number of Sprints that you need
18:28
per day to hit your goal so remember that we had a daily word count Target from this sheet over here 22.73 so I'm
18:36
going to write that here 22.73 then we're going to divide that by your
18:41
average word count per Sprint which for me is 650 words and don't this please
18:46
don't compare yourself to me 650 I type really fast it's really good one I
18:52
almost just started a fire there so for those of you that were freaking out uh yeah maybe I should blow that out but
18:58
I do like having it there um so if yours is 150 that's worth celebrating too everyone writes at their
19:05
own pace there's going to be some people that write a thousand plus words every 30 minutes and maybe they have to do
19:11
more editing than what you do maybe you take your time with each word and you only get 75 in per half hour that is
19:17
okay there's really put your number out there with no judgment we all write at different speeds we all edit at
19:23
different speeds and it's okay your way is your way and that's the best way
19:29
so we're going to take our little calculator here and we're going to say 22.73 is my word count Target per day in
19:36
Nano divided by 650 words per Sprint means that I'm going to need about three
19:43
and a half Sprints 3.49 Sprints per day so that that means that I can I could
19:50
write down here three and a half so I could do three 25 minute Sprints
19:56
and then one 10 minute Sprint or one 15 minute Sprint and I should make it through or I could
20:02
round it up and plan to do four Sprints which would take me about two hours a day and this is most likely what I'll do
20:08
because I want to get a little bit ahead plus this is just an average and I'm going to have some Sprints where I only
20:13
write 300 words and so I'm going to round myself up so if you get a half number or whatever I like to round it up
20:20
to the next one but this gives you such valuable information right here because this tells you how much time per day
20:27
you're going to need to dedicate to getting your writing done so we have a bunch of nanowrimo math
20:34
here so we're going to continue to work off of these numbers that we had over
20:40
here so again total Nano word count goal you're going to write it up here for me
20:46
50 000 words divided by the total writing days in November this is the same thing that we
20:52
just did on that other sheet gives us a total of 22.73 per day
20:57
my daily word count Target I'm going to pull that down from here is 22.73 my
21:04
average word count per Sprint we already said was 650 and again if you don't know this number do a few Sprints and see
21:11
what your average is number of Sprints per day means I'm going to need to do three and a half but remember I'm going
21:17
to round that up to four now what we're going to do is figure out how many Sprints you need for the entire
21:23
course of Nano so number of Sprints per day is four preferred length of Sprints plus
21:30
the breaks remember I said I'm going to do 25 minute Sprints plus a five minute break gives me 30 minutes so that's what
21:37
I'm going to write here so each one is going to be 30 minutes so I'm going to multiply four Sprints times 30 minutes
21:45
means that I need 120 Minutes or two hours per day
21:51
so let's say you have a desire to write
21:56
3 000 words a day that's how much you need to write if you write let's say 500 Words
22:05
per Sprint you're gonna need six Sprints per day to hit 3 000 and if
22:11
those Sprints in your mind are 20 minutes long then you're going to need also 120 minutes so it really matters
22:20
how long your Sprints are and how much you can write in that time so use this math I've got this whole page over here
22:25
is an example to walk you through that explains each of these things so now we take our total Nano word count goal
22:31
again which for me remember was 50 000 words divided by the average word count per
22:37
Sprint so for me 650 words per Sprint tells me how many Sprints I need to win
22:42
and we're going to use that on a future page so 50 000 words divided by 650 equals about 77 Sprints because I'm
22:51
going to round this 76.9 up to 77 Sprints so one of the reasons that I
22:57
like to do this personally with the Sprints is because it's so important to me when
23:05
you're actually trying to create a realistic plan for your month to know this number first of all how much time
23:11
do you need to set aside every day you're writing to get your writing done because if you only have an hour and you
23:17
haven't set aside extra time to write and the most you can do is 650 a Sprint
23:24
you're not going to hit your time you would only hit about 25 000 words for the month so it's important to know so
23:30
that when you're creating your plan for the month you know how much time to set aside the second thing is I like to know
23:37
how many Sprints total I need to win because I am a very futuristic and
23:43
strategic kind of person and I love to be able to say okay I got three down 72
23:48
to go today I got five down you know 68 to go or 67 to go so I like to be able
23:55
to to count that down and it's encouraging for me to see okay I got 50 and only 22 more 22 more 27 more you
24:03
know whatever it is and that stuff makes me feel really good and it gives me a Target so on this next set of pages I've
Word Count Tracker
24:10
given you space for 200 Sprints and hopefully that's going to be enough for
24:16
anybody but if you need more than 200 then you can feel free to print multiples of these Pages if you don't
24:22
need all 200 which it doesn't look like I'm going to then you can either use it during the month of December if you keep
24:30
writing or whatever but what I'm going to do is I've got these Sprints numbered and so I'm going to go over here and I'm
24:36
going to write a line under 77. because this is my target here
24:43
is that I'm hoping by the time I filled all these out and I get to number 77 my
24:48
book is going to be done which gives me a visual way to kind of track how far I've come and it gives me that little
24:54
bit of extra so you can put your book title and your daily Target remember my daily Target is 22.73
25:01
and then here's how you fill this out so you've got a space for how much you wrote during this Sprint so I'm going to
25:07
go ahead and fill this out as if um as if I'm already in the middle of Nano
25:14
so let's say I'm sitting down to write I do a Sprint and I write 710 words this
25:20
Sprint Today's total then because that's my only Sprint I've done today is also 710
25:26
and then my monthly total is 7 10 because that's how far I've come so far today
25:33
but let's say this next Sprint I get 589 words now what I'm going to do is so
25:38
this Sprint each Sprint you mark on this first column this column is where you add this number to this number so I'm
25:45
going to say 710 plus 589 gives me a daily total today of 12.99 and my
25:52
monthly total is the same now when I'm actually filling this out what I tend to do is I don't do this monthly total just
26:00
yet sometimes what I will do is I'll just add you know let's say I wrote 3 15 and then
26:08
I let's say I had an 8 91. so I would just go ahead and say 12.99 plus 315 is
26:14
16 14 and then plus 891 gives me 2505.
26:19
so I would just do this just these two this Sprint Today's total and then at
26:24
the end of the day I would put my monthly total so I would go like this this this this
26:30
this this this this this this this this this and then I would just carry this number down and add these two together
26:36
which would let's say it gives me like 5062 you know so I don't necessarily
26:42
fill out each one of these but you can if you want to fill it out as you go and
26:47
I love this type of Sprint tracker because it gives you so much information when you go back and look at it later
26:54
you can see how much you wrote per Sprint so when you get done with Nano you can actually come back if you're a
26:59
data analysis person it can be really fun to come back after Nano and go okay what was my average words per Sprint
27:06
because you could see how many Sprints let's say it actually took me 89 to get to 50K then I could say well I didn't
27:13
actually end up with um with 650 I ended up with about 562 words
27:22
per Sprint so then I can use that when I'm calculating next year's Nanos that it was more like 560 instead of 650. so
27:29
there's some data that you can gain from this stuff and it's really kind of cool so word count trackers can be fun
27:35
I've given you space for 200 Sprints then I've got some other fun trackers
27:40
here for you so this pixel tracker again I will say there are lots of different
27:47
ways that people use to share their Sprints and stuff and I saw this
27:52
originally I think from my friend Natalie Norwood who saw it from Sarah McLean and I don't know if she invented
27:58
it or came up with it herself or if she got it from someone else but I just wanted to say that and I will link to
28:04
Sarah's original post on Instagram where she used a pixel tracker like this so
28:09
basically the idea is that each row or each box or each bubble over here on the bubble tracker is a hundred words and I
28:17
have enough bubbles here for 50 000 words so if you write 100 words you
28:25
could fill this in for 100 words if you wrote 500 Words
28:30
then you would go ahead one two three four five and fill in all of these and you could do them all
28:37
in different colors you could do each writing session is a different color so you could visually see each writing
28:42
session you could fill them out downward diagonally however you want to do it but if you fill all of this out you should
28:48
have 50 000 words same thing with the bubble tracker you can just fill this in and if you wanted to you could also fill
28:55
it in and then take a black pen and say you know 100 200 300 400 something like
29:02
that I just thought this would be super fun way to track it if you wanted to put this in your planner or up on your wall
29:08
another visual representation then on this next page we have a rewards planner
Rewards Planner
29:14
because I think it is super valuable to reward yourself for your work so what I like to do during Nano is give myself or
29:21
plan out a reward that I can give myself for every 10 000 words and then something pretty big for hitting this
29:28
fifty thousand so it's just another way to motivate yourself that you could say
29:33
you know for Ten Thousand Words If once I hit 10 000 words I get to go to movie
29:39
night I'm gonna go out on a movie date night and just take the night off once I get to twenty thousand words I'm gonna
29:46
buy myself that um you know Hello Kitty hairy quadrant
29:51
planner once I hit 30 000 words I get a hundred
29:58
dollars to get my nails done once I hit 40 000 words I'm gonna get uh
30:05
dinner out whatever it might be or it could be ooh I'm gonna treat myself to ubereats
30:11
and get dinner delivered which is luxurious in my opinion 50 000 words
30:16
maybe it's something really big you're gonna buy yourself a new Chromebook or you're gonna get that t-shirt that you've been wanting for a long time or
30:23
um maybe you're gonna buy yourself a new laptop like whatever it is let's say you get you get your new laptop at 50k but
30:30
really spend some time thinking about these rewards and if you're short on cash and you don't want to spend money
30:38
on these rewards there's also other things that you can do like the movie night at home you can buy yourself go to
30:45
Dollar Tree and buy yourself some popcorn and some movie candy and you know sit down with some Netflix for two
30:51
or three hours and do a movie night binge um 20 000 words could be that you get to drive out to your favorite waterfall and
30:57
go for a hike that day so it doesn't have to be things that take money but just sit and think about things that you
31:03
really want to do so badly that you're willing to work for it so think about that
31:08
um this quote from Hugh Laurie is one that Lisa from our Sprint's little Forest Homes mentioned that she has up
31:15
on her wall so thank you for this it's a terrible thing I think in life to wait until you're ready I have this feeling
31:21
now that actually no one is ever ready to do anything there's almost no such thing as ready there's only now and you
31:27
may as well do it now generally speaking now is as good a time as any I do love that you know what the time is now if
31:34
you've been writing wanting to write that book if you've been trying to finish that book you want to get published use Nano as a springboard of
31:40
motivation and surround yourself with people that are gonna cheer you on this is the time
31:45
I also have another encouraging quote on the back of that I can and I will so let's do it um tools if you want to write out the
31:53
tools that you want to buy collect or prep so if you want index cards color-coded note cards or color-coded
32:00
Sharpies whatever little tools that you think you might want to get you can create a checklist here
32:05
the nanowrimo meal planner we're going to be going over in another video but basically the idea is that you write
32:11
down five breakfast ideas five lunch ideas three snack ideas and seven dinner
32:16
ideas and you're going to use that to plan out your meals for the quarter now
32:22
some people I know you just want to eat something different every day for breakfast me and we'll talk about this
32:28
in the prep your life for Nano video I'm happy eating the same breakfast every day if it makes it easy so we'll talk
32:35
more about this in a future video then you've got a section for your idea brainstorm where you could write out a
Novel Planner
32:42
brainstorm of all the ideas you're thinking about or you could write down the basic premise or the setting or any characters that you can think of any
32:48
scenes that you can think of this is just a brainstorm page then you've got space for your nanowrimo novel so you
32:55
can write out your working title the basic premise which is what is the story basically about what's at the heart of
33:00
the story the main character or characters the side characters the villain the main conflict and resolution
33:06
even if you're panting if you can tell some of these things that might be enough for you and this actually these
33:13
two pages can be really great for people who are panting you may not know all of these things but if you can list out a
33:20
couple of the characters some of the main conflict or idea and then a few ideas that you have for scenes you might
33:25
be Off to the Races when it comes to Nano because you've got a basic idea or structure but for some of us we need
33:32
more than this so we'll talk about that more in the future too creativity toolbox so I did a video on this last
33:37
year and I'm gonna link that for you down below but this is just simple Joys
33:42
so this is where you list things that just bring you Joy like a candle some of the washi tape that you have drinking
33:49
water out of a wine glass um you know surrounding yourself with
33:55
some beautiful crystals having a nice scent fill the room playlist that you
34:00
love anything that's simple um cozy socks your favorite you know hat
34:07
that you wear every time you're writing whatever it is that are simple Joys that help you feel creative so think of Nano
34:14
as a time where you really want to nurture yourself you want to get in there and you want to give yourself a big hug and say you can do this and
34:21
really give yourself that support that you need so the creativity toolbox is really all about what just makes you
34:27
feel like you want to write is it dancing is it music is it a candle is it
34:32
setting your space up just the right way um what is it is it a pep talk that you listen to you know let us know
34:39
rewards brainstorm so you list out the five big rewards earlier in the workbook but I would also think about potentially
34:46
writing a daily reward for yourself now this might be too stressful some people
34:52
like I don't want to think about a daily reward but it could be something as simple as putting 30 Hershey's Kisses in
34:58
a jar or 30 Washi tapes which it might be something that I will do you could
35:03
put 30 Washi tapes in a jar and every day when you finish writing you get to pick one out and now it's your new washi
35:09
tape it doesn't really matter what it is candy and food work really well if you eat sugar so that could be something
35:16
good it could also be um you know a bunch of pins so I have a bunch of these
35:22
like double ended brush markers that I have so you could go and buy a set of 30
35:27
pins like this and put those in a hat well not a hat but like a jar or
35:33
something and pick one out and get to use it every day but think about that you could also do surprises like take a
35:39
walk get on the treadmill you know whatever like health and self-care type stuff take a bath and you could put them
35:45
on pieces of paper and fold them up and put them into the jar and every day when you've hit your word count you get to
35:51
pull a surprise out of that hat and say all right yay I get to take a bubble bath tonight or yeah YouTube binge
35:56
that's what I'm gonna go do or pick the name of a book out say I'm going to read a chapter out of this book you know whatever so it could be really fun
36:02
something that you do every day and I haven't decided mine yet but I'm gonna do something
NaNoWriMo Planner
36:08
then we have our actual planner and please can we all take a moment to talk
36:15
about how crazy I am that I wanted to make this a 2023 planner when I originally did this some of you noticed
36:22
on Instagram this said 2023 and then Renee my operations manager noticed that
36:27
throughout this entire planner part I had put 2023. don't worry because yours
36:32
is fixed I didn't I didn't publish it to you guys as 2023 but I had already printed it for myself at that point so
36:38
it does say 2022 but my brain is already thinking about 2023 planners probably
36:44
because of the planathon which by the way the 2023 planathon starts tomorrow and I am a speaker at this free event
36:50
and it is incredible my business Mentor Amber McHugh runs this every year and there's so many amazing entrepreneurs
36:56
speaking so I'm going to leave a link for you to join that down below it's going to be awesome I'm so excited to be
37:01
a part of it come join us in the planathon but this is your Nano planner and it's different from last year and
37:07
I'm really proud of this this I think it's going to be really helpful also just as a side note if all I have
37:14
for you is this letter size if you want to print it for your A5 size binder you
37:19
could print it booklet print which would give it to per page basically and then you just cut the pages in half if you
37:25
wanted to print it in your classic size happy planner which is what I'll be doing you can print it at 82 percent
37:31
scale and I just print all the odd Pages first and then flip it over and print the even pages on the back but you can
37:39
print this at different sizes if you would like if you are printing on A4 paper because you're in Europe it's
37:44
going to have extra space at the top but you can still print this and just say fit to page so
37:51
you've got a space here for breakfast lunch dinner and snacks if you don't
37:56
want to plan out your meals you can just wipe this out or put a washi tape here but I'm going to be using this so you
38:02
can go back to refer to that page where I had you write your ideas out so it could be like breakfast as yogurt and
38:09
fruit lunch is um you know PB and J dinner is chicken
38:16
and veggies and your snack is going to be a protein bar you know whatever it is
38:22
and it you can make it pretty you can make it super detailed or you can just make it scribbled like I just did but
38:28
this way you've got a meal plan and we're going to talk more about this in the prepping your life video then down
38:34
below you've got a schedule and what I encourage you to do with this schedule is to sketch out when you're going to be
38:40
writing so for example if you're in our heartbreakings writing Community Tuesday evenings oh who is sprinting on Tuesday
38:46
I think maybe Rhiannon is sprinting on Tuesday evenings but I'm not 100 certain but I I'm I think that um Diane Sprints
38:55
in the afternoon and then Rhiannon and Sprints in the evening so you could write you know Diane I'm going to show
39:00
up at Diane Sprints at 1pm I don't know exactly the schedule for Nano but you
39:05
can check on that website and then I'm gonna join and that say I'm gonna spend two hours with her and then I'm gonna go
39:11
to Rhiannon sprints on YouTube um at 8pm
39:16
and that's going to be two hours I think she might go at nine but I'm in Central Time
39:22
so you could write out your schedule so you could say your whole day's schedule if you want to here or just when you
39:28
plan to write so for me because of that previous work we did I know I need two full hours to write so my schedule each
39:35
day is going to be where am I getting those two hours in and once I make a plan I know I'm going to be more
39:42
successful at it then you've got some dot grid over here if you want to put a quote or you want to keep track of your
39:47
word count for the week or you want to check off how many Sprints you were writing this week anything you want to
39:53
use that for and I have these planning Pages for you for every single week of
39:59
nanowrimo up until Wednesday the 30th and again yours is 2022 and then there's
40:06
a quote here from Jody piccolt that says you may not write it well every day but you can always edit a bad page you can't
40:12
edit a blank page then you also have this last page here
Emergency Motivation
40:17
called emergency motivation so it's possible that at some point during the month of November you're just going to
40:23
want to quit you fall too far behind you're too tired you don't know where the story goes next then you can go to
40:28
your emergency motivation and that is where you can brainstorm anything that
40:33
makes you feel inspired to write or helps you to remember why you started this in the first place so it could be a
40:40
movie that you love it could be your favorite anime it could be a book that just makes you think about your heroin
40:47
like let's say you were inspired by The Hunger Games and you're writing a dystopian why a similar to that you
40:52
could go back and read The Hunger Games for a couple days and just take some time off even if it means you don't win
40:58
50k at Nano it'll mean that you love your story and I think we can all agree that that's more important so what are
41:04
some emergency motivation things that you can set up for yourself so it's like oh my gosh I'm struggling I can't figure
41:09
things out your emergency motivation could also be a second Story by the way let's say you
41:15
get halfway through and you're like oh the story's not coming together your emergency motivation could be oh but I
41:20
have this other shiny idea that I really wanted to explore so I'm going to start writing that and yes it's going to make you a nano Rebel to switch projects
41:27
mid-stream and for some people switching projects is not a great idea but for some people that might be the way to get
41:32
your brain going again you know is something spark of something new on this last page here I have another
41:40
letter I have my Instagram and Facebook if you want to tag me there I also have a list of or a link to my first three
41:47
books of My Shadow Demon Saga if you have loved all of this stuff that I have been putting out for you one way that
41:52
you can pay it forward of course is to go and download my books the first set of three books in that series are free
41:58
so give them a chance even if you don't normally read young adult you might enjoy it um and then also the hard breathing's
42:05
writing Community website where we will be doing sprints all month long another way you can pay it forward if you
42:10
appreciate these free resources of course is to subscribe and tell other people in your writing Community about
42:16
my channel and about these free resources so final page says do not
Final Thoughts
42:22
disturb writer at work because whether you've published or not you are a writer and you should claim that and you should
42:28
put this on your door so that nobody comes and bugs you when you're writing so that is our preptober planner thank
42:34
you for hanging out with me for a long while today to go through through it all but this type of prep with the math and
42:40
figuring out how long you need to write how much time like what's your daily word count Target can be so incredibly
42:46
helpful so I hope you'll take the time to go through it if it seems like something that you would enjoy going through and of course
42:53
we will be going through a lot more of these things like the meal planning how to prep your space how to plan your novel and this Thursday's video this
43:01
next video coming up is going to be basically how to plan your novel so we're going to be talking about how do you plan if you're a pantser and then
43:08
how do you plan if you're a plotter and how much of your novel do you need to have figured out to be successful at
43:14
Nano we're going to talk about all those fun things so I will see you in Thursday's video lots more fun preptober
43:19

44:22
thank you

hey guys welcome back to harp readings I have done some videos in the past on my
0:05
plotting notebook and the different things that I take with me when I go to plot or how I use my stationery to
0:11
outline but I thought it was time for an update because I pretty much took a year
0:18
off of writing I won't say I exactly took it off but I'll just say that while I was pregnant and the past six months
0:25
my baby's almost six months old next week she'll be six months I have not been writing as much as I typically
0:31
would as much as I want to and I'm so ready both emotionally and just like
0:37
career-wise to get back on the saddle so to speak back on the typewriter I don't
0:43
know and ready to start writing again so one of the things that I love to do when
0:48
I'm ready to like start a new project or I need that extra bit of momentum because truthfully there's a little bit
0:54
of fear of like getting back into it am I really going to be able to write as fast as I used to how am I going to
0:59
balance everything I'm also dealing with some postpartum anxiety and depression so it's like how am I going to be able
1:05
to keep everything going and not fall into some of those like old traps of self confidence and other issues that
1:12
I've fallen into as a writer in the past so I'm trying to really be supportive of myself my mental health my emotional
1:18
state and sometimes I've found that one of the tricks to getting myself into that mood of motivation and excitement
1:26
and being back into it is no surprise stationery which I know sounds silly but
1:31
for me it really works and it doesn't mean that you have to spend a lot of money but it's just kind of like reimagining the things and the tools
1:38
that you use as a writer and for me that really works of like moving into a new plotting notebook setting up some new
1:44
plotting sheets really thinking about my character sheets and the tools that I'm gonna use the pins and the highlighters
1:50
and the markers and other things like that and it's not that I've gone out and bought new stuff but I have bought a few
1:56
new things and I have reimagined my plotting notebook so I'm excited to show that to you guys today you can see I've
2:03
kind of got all my stuff set up over here to start recording that for you and thank you all for your feedback on
2:08
enjoying the like white background underneath it so you can kind of see thing a little bit better so hopefully you'll
2:14
enjoy that today so I'm excited to show you kind of how I have revamped my plotting notebook and all of the
2:20
stationery that I'm using some of it you'll recognize from before and some of it will be new in order to motivate
2:26
myself to be writing again I also have a freebie for you today that I developed and just like designed for myself as a
2:32
way to help me keep on track and as a way to help me like really see my progress and how long it's taking me to
2:39
go through each stage of the writing process so I'm gonna walk you through that and I've got a link for you to be able to download that below so let's get
New Cover
2:47
started okay so this is my gorgeous new plotting notebook I'm still using a
2:53
happy planner deluxe cover so this is just one of their big like faux leather covers that you can put a big happy
3:00
planner into and it just sort of slides into the back here you can see it has a pocket and you just slide the back cover
3:06
into the happy planner cover and then it has some various pockets and things like
3:12
that so we're gonna go over how all this looks but basically you can see if you
3:17
want to see the one I was using before you can see it in this video I will put it up in the cards here as well as down
3:23
in the description box below but I was using similar system like an old happy planner but I was using a cover that
3:31
said the word hustle on it it's a pink cover and I like that cover but I'm not a fan of the word hustle anymore because
3:37
it just implies that you have to like work really hard and like work yourself to death and right now as a mom to a new
3:43
baby and with the seven year old and everything else that I have going on it's not about hustle it's about joy and
3:48
alignment and doing things that make me happy and that hopefully serve my community so that word just didn't
3:54
really align or you know go with where I am right now in my life so I have
4:00
switched binders what happened was a happy planner had a sale on their big
4:05
deluxe covers and they were only like three ninety-nine and so I said okay for four dollars I'm gonna get it the kicker
4:11
is that you still had to pay for shipping so I ordered a few new things and I'll show you kind of as I go so
4:16
basically I grabbed just the black deluxe cover and it has this little black and white polka dot pattern inside
4:23
then also at Michaels I found this big plans decal that was in the clearance
4:29
section and it had this and another gold one that I can't remember in a two-pack and it was like 50 cents so I was super
4:35
excited to find that because this black cover doesn't have any words on it or anything like that so I just put the
4:40
word big plans on there and I think it looks really classy and really fun and it'll match any kind of color scheme
4:46
that I want to put into it so that made me really happy the other big purchase that I made to make this happen or a
Purchases
4:52
couple purchases I bought these lavender metal disks because my branding and my
4:58
covers and stuff is typically purple so you can see this is like one of my like
5:03
logos and my purple and white branding so I thought well that's perfect and it
5:08
looks so nice with the beautiful demon's cover art which is this is the cover art for my very first book called beautiful
5:15
demons so I thought that would be fun but I really wanted to be able to make my own covers so the other big purchase
5:22
that I made for this kind of reimagine and this one I did spend some money on was this arc punch I think it was like
5:28
$49 on Amazon which I know is pricey but I also know that I'm going to use this a lot so I was previously using the happy
5:36
planner punch and I was using the big one which you can use for the classic and the mini size and I really enjoy that punch the problem is that punch
5:44
does not do well with laminated covers especially thick ones and I've heard people say that they use their happy
5:49
planner punch for that but it just didn't work for mine it always would get stuck I almost broke the punch itself
5:55
and so I was like okay that's not gonna work so either I need to find someone that can make custom like happy planner
6:01
covers for me or I need to buy a better punch and some thicker laminating sheets so I went with the punch so that I could
6:08
do my own covers you know as much as I want in the future but this was a pretty big expense so if you can ever find the
6:13
arc punch which is like staples brand for cheaper it's Snagit if you ever find it on clearance at Staples definitely
6:20
get it then I was looking at potentially doing 10 mil laminating sheets but to be
6:26
honest my laminator which is a scotch thermal laminator doesn't do it set it
6:32
doesn't say that it's approved for the 10 millimeter sheets so I just bought five mil so this could
6:38
be a little bit less flexible it could be a little bit harder or sturdier like the traditional happy planner covers but
6:44
actually I'm pretty fine with how it turned out so I bought some of those five mil plastic laminating sheets from
6:50
Amazon and the arc punch and the different little metal discs and that's
6:55
pretty much all I bought that was like new purchase so like I said this stuff was about twenty bucks and then this was
7:02
about fifty so a little bit more money on this side of things but let me walk you through kind of how I've set up my
Front
7:09
new plotting planner so here in the front you have basically just stuff that's decorative but also nice to have
7:15
out when I'm out planning like at Barnes & Noble or Panera or somewhere else or
7:21
even just in my house I'll often take this up to the bedroom and I'll have the baby on my lap and be working in this
7:26
plotting planner so I basically just have a few little things here like this is kind of cute right here it says we
7:34
are all made of stars and then this little like crystal bottle I snagged
7:40
these from the digital dash box and if you watch my monthly like planner setups you know that I use the digital dash box
7:46
from planner press so this is from maybe like August of 2019 or 2018 maybe even
7:52
no probably August of 2019 or it could have been some time last year I can't remember what month but she did kind of
7:58
a like space and crystal like New Age vibe and I really loved that month so I
8:03
just pulled some things I had created for that month and just put them in here then I also have a few sticky notes that
8:09
are from Michaels as well that is just this little unicorn this you got this is
8:14
another like sort of chipboard sticker that I got on clearance at Michael's for about 50 cents this backing here where
8:21
you see these flowers is from it's like a acetate sheet from simply gilded subscription box so I already had that
8:28
kind of in my stash I made this little bow myself I sewed it together there was
8:33
a tutorial I watched here on YouTube so I've been using that kind of over and over I got this little Palace in
8:40
Wonderland from an Etsy shop years and years ago I don't even remember but to
8:46
get to the actual plotting stuff because of course that's all mostly graded decorative I have these teacher
8:52
creative resources dots now if you watch my previous plotting planner setup you've seen these before but these are
8:58
just you know round circular dots that are used usually on like activity charts
9:04
or whatever in schools but I use them for my color coding for my pov so I'm
9:09
often write multiple POVs my main series I have four points of view and sometimes five in this series I have a total of
9:16
eight points of view so I thought it was perfect when I found these stickers that had eight different colors so I use them
9:21
in conjunction with some tombow dual brush pens in order to have a color code and I'll show you how I use that in just
9:28
a minute then I have another little stencil back here that came from the Michaels recollection planner stuff and
9:34
then in the back here behind the pocket I have lots of little things so I have
9:39
this little I'll show that in just a second so I have some washi tape stickers that I got also from happy
9:47
planner I've had these for years and I love taking these on the go because you can just take one sheet instead of
9:52
taking like a whole roll of washi tape or whatever and when I want to use them in my plotting planner because I just
9:58
like to keep things decorated and cute I can just pull something off the sheet and pull it and tear it apart or
10:03
whatever and have little page flags and things like that so this was an entire like booklet just like the happy planner
10:09
sticker sheets and I just pulled some of the sheets out that I've been using then I also have some little flags that I use
10:14
sometimes some sticky notes and that sort of thing here in the back this little booklet here if you want to see
10:20
how I created this I just made it out of index cards and washi tape and if you want to see how I made this this is a
10:26
portable plotting notes booklet that I tend to carry with me when I can't carry the big thing and I will show you
10:33
exactly how I made these in a video that I will link for you down below so look for that down below about how to make a
10:39
portable plotting notes booklet I've got this idea from another channel here on YouTube so I've linked to her channel
10:45
underneath mine in that video but this is basically it's not set up right now so if you want to see the setup go watch
10:52
that other video but basically I can use this to put the different POVs in so you can see the different colors of washi
10:57
tape and keep my different plotting notes for each point of view in here as well as my over
11:03
all notes for the entire novel and then when I'm ready to be like on the go like I'm riding with my nano group and we
11:09
just don't have room for everybody to have huge notebooks and laptops on the table then I can just take this as my
11:15
notes booklet and I really love having this of course it's not filled out because I just trashed my old one and
11:20
I'm restarting this book so I'll talk a little bit more that in a second then this little sticker is for a group of
11:27
friends that are in a Facebook group with me so that's kind of a little personal thing there I have a little
11:32
happy planner set of sticky notes that just clips on to the disks and then we
11:38
get into the actual planner itself so I started out with my beautiful demons cover because I felt like that is
11:43
perfect for a plotting planner and you'll see as I go through that every time I have a new book I have separated
Cover
11:50
it out with the book cover of the book I'm actually working on so this one's just like the overall cover and then
11:56
I've got kind of dividers for each book but since each one of these books is not finished yet I haven't revealed any of
12:02
the cover so you guys are gonna see a little bit of them but not the full reveal of the covers yet so faith
12:07
surrender is the book that I'm currently working on it is book 3 of my eternal sorrow series I have been working on
12:13
this book for well over a year and a half now and just had a lot of struggle
12:19
with it when I was pregnant and now if you know not really sleeping well and struggling with some postpartum depression and stuff has been really
12:26
difficult to get back into it but I'm finally starting to like come up for air and I feel like I'm ready to really work
12:32
on this book and I have a rough draft that's about 65,000 words and I'm just
12:38
not happy with it it just doesn't feel like it's coming together I feel like I need to just kind of start over and I'm
12:43
sure I'll use a lot of the words that I already have but I'm gonna approach it with a fresh mindset so I'm starting the
12:49
plotting process over I'm starting all my notes over and we're gonna see if that will help me rather than trying to
12:54
like pick up where I left off a long time ago to like kind of get back into it so I just printed out a page with the
13:01
book cover on it and then if you've watched any of my plotting stuff like house getting ready for nano and how I edit my novels and
Happy Planner Sheet
13:08
stuff you've seen this spread before because I already had created this but this is an old happy planner sheet and I
13:15
just whited out the line and I'm using it for my plotting so I've got those same little colorful dot
13:24
stickers here to indicate the different points of view my word count goal is 95,000 words I also I'm gonna stick a
13:30
book cover up here but I've changed the book cover since the last time I was plotting so I need to just change it out and then I'm going to put like the first
13:37
part of Act one the second part of act 1 act 2 part 1 and part 2 then the
13:42
midpoint of the novel will be here and then the second half of act 2 will go here and then act 3 in this final column
13:48
and that's the way I'd like to use these happy plainer things because the act 3 is usually the shortest act to kind of
13:53
comes in two parts and this works out really well for me to keep it separated and what I'll do is I'll go through and
13:59
I'll put like if Parrish is the first chapter I'll put a purple dot here and then a just a quick like note about what
14:05
happens in that chapter and then as the novel fills out I'll be able to you know move those things around I used to and
14:12
I'll show you in another part of this book how sometimes I will use sticky notes that I can move them around so I
14:18
probably will be pulling out some sticky notes to work on this plot now that I'm working on it all over again then I just
14:25
taped a on the back of this since there would be another piece of like happy
HB Writing Tracker
14:30
planner planner sheet I just taped a dot grid sheet on the back this is also
14:35
something that is brand new and I actually have this as a free download for you down below if you're interested
14:41
in it I just made it for myself to try to help me keep track so what this is
14:46
this I'm calling it the HB writing tracker like heart breathing's writing tracker where you can put the title of
14:51
your book the word count goal that you're reaching for so like 95,000 words you're hoping it's going to be or
14:57
whatever then in this column you write the date so if I was starting today I would say 2 28 20 the phase is outlining
15:06
so the phase could be outlining phase the rough draft phase the first editing
15:11
pass phase beta reader phase whatever the phase of writing you're in or stage
15:16
you can write that here then you can write your progress for the day so if it was to 28 phases outlining I could put
15:23
how many hours I worked or I could put how many words I wrote or since it's an outline I could say that
15:29
got through act 1 and then I'm gonna put some notes down here now personally one of the things I'm gonna include in the
15:35
notes is how much time I spent on it this day so I'm going to put like you
15:40
know one and a half hours or one hour and 28 minutes or whatever because I want to keep track of how long each
15:45
phase of the writing process is taking me right now so in my notes I'm going to put the time if you decide to use this
15:52
you can use that slot however you want but I'm probably going to say something along the lines of like finished the
15:59
first act plotting it went really well I'm gonna put kind of how I felt about it it was really easy or I got very
16:04
distracted and then in the bottom corner of each notes section I'm gonna write how long I spent on it so I've got a lot
16:10
of sheets of that types of columns so that you can put exactly what you were
Back To Back Sheets
16:17
working on how long it took you and that sort of thing and you have basically five pages of those notes but you if you
16:24
wanted to and you needed it you can always print out more because they've just got the back-to-back sheets so say
16:30
like by the bottom of this page you were already into the rough draft phase but that took you a long time then you've
16:36
got the editing phase the publishing phase you know whatever it is and then you needed more sheets you just print
16:42
these out again and insert them in to your notebook then this final spread
16:47
here is basically kind of like where you keep track of how it went over the course of writing so you can say the
16:54
first writing phase was the outlining phase my goal start date was 228 but I actually started on 229 then my
17:02
completion date was let's say I finish it by 310 so I would write the day I
17:09
completed it so then I would go from the actual start date to the date of completion and calculate how many total
17:14
days so if I started on 229 and went to the tenth then I worked eleven day so I would write eleven total days then over
17:21
here I could say my target word count was you know 95 thousand words and my actual word count was you know whatever
17:29
so when I'm talking about the outlining phase I'm not gonna have a word count so I'll just put a slash through that but
17:34
then next I would go to the rough draft phase and I would say when I had hoped to start it when I actually started it
17:39
when I finish and how many days it took me then I could say my target word count was 95,000 words but my actual word count
17:46
ended up being and then I would put exactly what the word count was ninety eight thousand three hundred twenty three words or whatever it is then over
17:53
here I would put how many hours I invested and the only reason I'm going to know that is because I've been
17:58
keeping track of it in the notes section so if you don't track your hours you won't be able to fill this out so that's
18:05
why I'm suggesting I guess I could go back potentially and in this progress section you you know I could leave a
18:10
place for how much time it took you on that date but I'm gonna just leave it as
18:16
is for now and I might change it later after I've been using it for a while I literally just created this last night
18:21
so hours invested and then notes so I could say wow this outlining phase took
18:27
me a lot longer than I expected and here's where the distractions came in then on the rough draft I could say you know I really ran into a hard spot
18:34
during the midpoint where I'd bla bla bla bla bla so I'm going to keep track
18:39
of all of that and sample writing phases down the side here might be outlining the rough draft stage first pass first
18:48
edit pass second edit pass third edit pass because for me those are all kind of different phases and I don't I don't
18:54
always do three rounds of edit but just in case so I might name them something different then down here it might be
18:59
final read-through phase then beta reader phase and how long that took then
19:05
arc reader phase or publishing phase or formatting phase and all that sort of thing maybe even marketing plan and how
19:12
long that took me to come up with so this is kind of going to be a work in progress to see how I end up using this sheet but I think that over time if I
19:19
use something similar to this for all of my novels moving forward and I have this sheet that tells me how long it really
19:26
took me like how many hours and how many days it really took me for each stage of the writing process that's gonna help me
19:32
to better estimate how long it takes me to finish a novel in the future and I'll be able to actually try to like compete
19:38
against myself in a way and say well last time it took me you know 80 days to write the rough draft let me see if I
19:44
can mark that down to 70 days knowing that this is where my distractions and my problems came in here's how I can fix
19:51
it and get better at it but it'll also help me if you guys are aware of my HB 90 system
19:56
you know a lot of that is based on estimating how long something's going to take you or like if you did the writing
20:03
scheduled for 2020 with me a lot of trying to figure out your writing schedule is all about how long and
20:08
estimating how long it's going to take you to finish a novel so I'm hoping over the course of this year after writing two or three books hopefully by the end
20:15
of the year I'm gonna have some really good data on how long it actually takes me to finish a book so if you would like
20:20
to use this download go ahead and grab it in my HP resource library if you're
20:25
on my mailing list you already have a link to the HP resource library and all of my resources including the plotting
20:31
pages I'm going to go over next are in that resource library if you're not on my mailing list then there's a link down
20:37
below for how to join it and you will get access to that library as well okay
Writing Plan
20:43
so then I have a writing plan here which is something similar this is an older one and this is also in the resource
20:49
library title word count goal words per day goal and then I also have the goal an actual starting date for all of these
20:55
things like when I want to have my plotting completed my rough draft completed and it's completed so I think
21:00
that this will go well with this other sheet so there's that sheet then there's
21:06
a word count tracker and again this is also in the HP resource library for free for you guys and how you use this as you
21:12
write the date and then you write you know how much you got in this sprint and
21:18
so if you're going to just do one sprint you would fill it out all the way across you would say today's date 20 to 28
21:24
sprint 110 words today 110 words my total is however much you have total in
21:30
your manuscript but if you're gonna do like five or six sprints you would just say the date and then you would just not
21:36
fill out you like I would fill out the date here and then draw a line through the next five sprints or whatever then
21:42
each sprint I would write how much I got for that sprint so each individual sprint and then once the day is over and
21:48
I'm done with all my sprints I would mark here like what my total was for the day of all the sprints and then my total for the manuscript so as I go through
21:55
this sheet some of these like today's are not going to be filled out because that's going to be the total but all of
22:00
the sprint ones should be filled out hopefully that makes sense if you guys want to see it actually in use let me
22:06
know and I'll do another video and of course I'm gonna need more than probably just this many Sprint's to
22:11
finish the book so I'll probably print it out and put it back in here as well okay so then I get into the different
Plotting Notes
22:19
like actual part of my plotting notes and I have just printed out some dot grid paper that I got off of Etsy it's
22:25
just a download and I can link that for you down below as well and I sometimes will do like what my
22:31
plan is you can see I already messed this one up because I was trying to get the book done by the 28th then here we are and it's not finished so that will
22:38
probably just get thrown away but you can see how I use these like washi tapes
22:43
and stickers to just kind of make my notes look more interesting which then
22:48
kind of breaks them up a little bit and makes them easier to read and reference then I'm also currently doing a reread
22:55
of des awakening where I'm making notes about things that happened and as it comes to me like as I'm reading if I get
23:01
any ideas about what's going to happen in the final book in the series then I've been making notes on that so I'm reading it and my husband is also
23:08
reading it then I've got just some planing dot grid note pages and more
23:14
notes and brainstorming stuff so again you can see how I use like different pen colors and tags and or flags and washi
23:22
tape to kind of just make that look better it makes me happy not necessary but I enjoy it when I'm making notes in
23:29
my planner then I have this little sheet where I was making some notes about the plot and how it's going to go so I keep
23:35
kind of all my notes in one place because it used to be when I was plotting I would put notes all over the
23:42
place I'd have some notes in my phone I'd have some notes on sticky notes some notes on note cards so with this I just
23:47
can put all my notes either right here inside this plotting planner or inside
23:53
this little notebook and then if I put it in here I usually try to transfer it
23:58
to this or keep it tucked in here so that way I know exactly where my notes are and it all works out then I've got
24:05
my plotting sheets so if you're not familiar with my channel I have an entire series on how to plot your novel
24:11
that came with a free download of basically all the things I was talking about in the structure that I use to
24:17
plot my novel so I've basically just printed out the that two bulls eight times for each of my
24:23
eight points of view and then I used a little sparkly washi tape flag to
24:28
indicate and make tabs for each of those points of view I also put a little bit of washi tape on the bottom of each of
24:34
these so I had filled some of these out and thrown them out and now I'm kind of starting over so I've started over with
24:40
Perish and what I do with multiple POV I'm gonna have another video coming up soon on multiple POV is I fill out these
24:47
sheets for each point of view as much as I can so I've got parish I've got Noah I've got Carmen and you can see it's not
24:54
filled out yet because I threw a lot of this stuff out and I'm kind of starting over crash the boy Zoe the witch and the
25:01
dark one so these are all my plotting sheets that hopefully will be filled out soon I'm going to work on a lot of this
25:06
this weekend then I also have a bunch of these sheets that are kind of like sort
25:12
of my three act structure sheets so it's similar in setup to that main sheet that
25:17
I talked about with act 1 act 2 part 1 part 2 and act 3 that's exactly what I do here act 1 act 2 part 1 the second
25:25
half of act 2 and then act 3 so it's kind of three act structure but sort of in four pieces and this is sort of like
25:32
my practice run for what's going to go on these bigger sheets because I like to print several of them and again this is
25:38
in that free download for you I like to print several of them and then kind of play around with well what about moving
25:44
this scene here what about moving this scene here and it feels less permanent so I have lots of those printed outs as
25:50
I'm working through the plotting and then I have all my older notes still in
25:55
here so these are notes from last year that I took and I'm still kind of taking
26:01
into consideration but just design wise you can kind of see how I like to set up
26:06
my story notes with different washi tapes and different stickers to just
26:11
kind of make it look nice but I'm also making notes of like different story threads I need to carry through things
26:17
that are happening in the story major plot points that I'm considering and that sort of thing so that's four deaths
26:22
awakening series or the eternal sorrow series where I'm working on the final book then the next book that I've got in
26:29
here is vengeful darkness and again I haven't done the cover reveal and this is not actually book 12 the should be book 11 my cover artist has
26:36
recently changed that and here I've got that same writing plan that I was
26:43
working on before and then I've got my notes pages sort of clipped off because this series is already a ten book series
26:50
and there's a lot of spoilers in my notes so I'm not going to even show you guys those but when I'm ready to start
26:57
working on this like right now I just have this section full of basically dot grid or blank sheets to be able to jot
27:03
down notes as I go through like okay I'm gonna add to this oh I got this one idea but when I get ready to work on this
27:09
book and this book is finished I will pull all of these sheets out and save
27:14
them in an old hobby planner and what I'll do is I will set up these same types of plotting pages with the flags
27:21
for this book because this book is going to have actually five points of view so I will color I have a special color code
27:27
for those as well and I'll set up all of those plotting sheets and print them out but right now I don't have enough space
27:32
since this book has eight points of view to put those a these five and then all
27:37
the ones for this final book so right now I've got this one then over here I've got the disappearance of Vanessa
27:44
Shaw another cover that hasn't been revealed this is another book I've really liked to have out by summer but
27:49
I'm just not sure if I'll have time so I've got my writing plan and then I've got notes that from when I started
27:54
working on this book last year and here you can kind of see that I used some sticky notes here and there so here I've
28:01
got that same type of happy planner plotting sheets and I'm using sticky
28:06
notes to kind of leave you know notes for myself when I'm not ready for it to
28:11
be kind of like permanent notes yet I also have those same character journey and plotting sheets for this book as you
28:19
can see here so then I've got same kinds of notes and you can see very similar type of style with different washi tapes
28:26
and stickers and things like that and yeah so I've got a lot of this stuff
28:32
filled out and I even have some notes here about another book that will be part of that sort of horror standalone
28:40
series called the haunting of Luna Day so I've got notes for that book in here as well and I just have some random
28:45
happy planner sheets that I use for checklists and in the back more notes on
28:51
a book I was reading by km Weiland called carrot creating character arcs which is amazing and I can link that down down
28:56
below for you so I like to take notes so that I can go back and kind of remember what she said about it so I've kept
29:02
those notes in here so that I can reference them and then the final thing is I just have a wrong wrong happy
29:08
planner sticker book in the back here so that I can use these stickers as I'm planning and there's a perfect little
29:15
pouch here to put that and slide it into the back and be able to use it then I also I'm just using this Emily lay happy
29:22
stripe pin kind of stays with this notebook so that is my newly updated
29:28
plotting planner and I am excited to kind of dig back in to plotting this
29:34
book and getting started on it and I'm also really excited about taking the time this is something I've been wanting
29:40
to do forever to actually mark down how long each phase of the process is taking me and have a complete set of notes and
29:48
data for how long it took me to finish the book and I'm hoping this will be helpful not only for me but for you as
29:54
well and if you do end up using this please let me know and feel free to go tag me over on Instagram if you print
30:00
this out for yourself so that I can see how you're using it so my instagram is
30:05
at heart breathing's blog and you can use the hashtag heart breathing's so alright guys that is a look at my
30:11
plotting planner and it just in case you were curious I did make these little ribbon bookmarks as well these little
30:19
ribbon paper clips and all I did was take a regular gold paper clip and some
30:24
stray ribbon and just looped it through and that's all I did so these were super easy to make if you have any little bit
30:30
any little bits of ribbon so alright okay so that's it for our inside look at
Outro

Planning For Writers
hello everybody welcome back to heart breathings it is video number three of how to plan and write a series and
0:07
this is one that i know a lot of you have been looking forward to so today i am going to talk to you about how do
0:13
you actually plan out your series how much do you need to know in advance how do you get all the details straight
0:19
how do you follow story threads and breadcrumbs and keep track of character arcs and oh my gosh it feels like a lot
0:25
to track well i happen to have a lot of experience with this because not only have i written
0:31
multiple series and have worked in more than five series i have a couple of completed series
0:36
as well as a series that has over one million words in the world i have been writing
0:42
one series in particular my shadow demon saga for the last 10 years so i do have a lot of experience and i've made a
0:49
lot of mistakes along the way so hopefully you guys will benefit from some of that so we're just gonna dive
0:55
straight in if you're interested in learning how to plan out your series just stay tuned
1:01
[Music] okay so as we dive into this idea
1:07
of how to actually plan out your series i think the best way to sort of unravel
1:13
all the questions that you might have is to address them head on so what i'm going to do is i'm going to present
1:18
questions that have been asked to me about how to plan it out and i'm just going to answer them as
1:24
briefly as i can i'm a talker i can't help it but i hope that this becomes a valuable tool and resource for you as
1:30
you are planning your own series also keep in mind that if you download this workbook it is going to walk you
1:36
through a lot of the process and actually walk you through a lot of the planning for your series so make sure you grab
1:42
that from the link down below so one of the common questions that i get asked is how do i know if i have
1:48
enough for a series one of the first things that you should do is identify what type of series you're writing so
1:54
again the workbook is going to walk you through this but basically figure out what's the main genre are you writing a mystery are you
2:01
writing an urban fantasy are you writing a romance series what's your main genre then decide what type of series
2:08
are you writing and if you don't understand the differences between types of series head back to video one
2:14
in this video series you can review those types which i also have a review in the workbook for you
2:19
so a dynamic series for example is the kind that where every book builds upon itself and it's
2:25
one big story arc if you think that you're writing a dynamic series
2:30
then all you need to think about is do i have enough plot or enough of a story world
2:37
here that it is going to take me multiple books to tell the whole story so for example if you were writing
2:44
something similar to the lord of the rings where you know the main story arc or series arc
2:51
of that book or that series is getting this ring that rules them all to
2:57
the place where you can destroy it and is this band of adventurers
3:04
going to be able to fulfill that story promise of destroying the ring in one single
3:10
book or is it going to take them multiple adventures multiple books to get to where they need
3:16
to go and another thing if you're thinking about character arc and you think about someone like frodo
3:21
who is the one charged with carrying that ring is he going to grow into the character
3:27
that he needs to be in order to destroy the ring in one single book is this something you can
3:33
tell over the course of a hundred thousand words or three hundred thousand words if you wanna make it a really long book
3:38
or is this something where he's gonna have to grow a little bit and face one big bad and then he's gonna have to
3:44
face another big challenge and another one and another one you don't have to necessarily know how many books it's
3:51
going to be right from the start you just need to know is this going to take me multiple
3:56
storylines to get to the final battle so think about harry potter since most
4:02
of us are familiar with that there was no way that you were going to get harry to
4:08
hogwarts and have him grow up enough in skill and maturity and understanding
4:15
his whole team and his resources and meeting everyone he needs to meet and defeat baltimore in one single book
4:22
there's just too much story there to tell in a single novel so you would know at that point even if
4:28
you don't know how many books it's going to take him to grow up enough and meet the right people and go through enough things and get the
4:34
right resources together and the right knowledge to defeat baltimore you don't know how many books is going to take you to get
4:41
there but you know it's going to be multiple books then you can go ahead and start your series plan because yes
4:47
you have enough to keep going when it comes to a standalone or episodic style series you just need to
4:54
understand are there enough characters or enough mysteries for my characters to solve that i can
5:01
write multiple so for example if you're writing a contemporary romance series
5:06
and you have this one specific couple in mind if you're thinking about a series and
5:11
whether or not you have enough content to write a whole series just think about the relationships that those
5:16
two characters have because if it's romance you've got a hero and a heroine or a hero and a hero or however your
5:22
couple is mixed so think about each individual main character and who are their friends
5:29
who are their family who lives in the town with them what what types of experiences do they have
5:34
and who do they know so you might discover through that that actually your hero has 12 brothers and sisters and you
5:41
really want to make this a family related series where you're going to feature a couple based on this family every
5:48
single time or like my fair hope series there are six books in that series and each book features a different
5:55
couple in a group of high school friends so think about your story world and whether
6:01
or not you have enough people and relationships there that interest you and that will interest the reader
6:06
that will tie together to make a complete series same thing with the mystery series if
6:12
you have a main detective or a sleuth of some kind can you think up enough mysteries that
6:17
are happening in this town or in this situation that they're going to be able to solve multiple things if you do then you have
6:23
enough for a series another question that people ask a lot is how do i know how many books it's going to take me to tell
6:29
this story this is a much more complicated question and it's one that i don't have a definitive answer for you one
6:36
thing i will tell you is trust your intuition because sometimes with certain types of stories you're
6:42
going to just be able to sit down and really map it out you're going to say well there are six best friends that i'm
6:48
telling their stories so each book is going to be a different friend story so i have six books and you're
6:54
just going to be able to plan it out and you know that that's the way it's going to be you also might have a detective series
7:00
or a small town romance series where it's open-ended that you might have you know you can think of five different
7:06
murders that your detective's going to solve but you also know that there's the possibility that they're going to solve
7:12
20 different mysteries because you have tons of ideas you don't have to have all the answers
7:18
right from the start so if you you know you can think of three different mysteries but you think you're gonna like writing this
7:24
character enough to write multiple then just plan for those three and then let it evolve
7:30
naturally with a dynamic series like i was talking about with say the lord of the rings i don't know
7:35
if tolkien knew it was going to be a trilogy he probably did because i think fantasy authors tend to plan things out
7:41
a little bit more detail but really all you need to do is you need to think about with a dynamic
7:47
series where does my character or group of characters start in the beginning and what is going to be that overarching
7:55
series arc so you're going to need a story arc per book but with a dynamic series you
8:01
also need that overarching series arc and if you have no idea what i'm talking about right now go watch
8:06
video number two in the series i will link it for you down below so in a dynamic series you need both of
8:12
those things you need that individual story arc and you need the overarching story arc
8:17
and that overarching story arc usually is something that takes place over the
8:23
course of the entire series so all you need to think about is where is my character or group of
8:29
characters in the beginning where do they end up and then you could create a rough sketch
8:35
of what moves them forward in each individual book and like i said i do have some worksheets that you can use to
8:41
help you with this but sometimes you're gonna think well this will take me four books and you're gonna get to book three or
8:47
four and realize oh my gosh there's seven or eight books involved in this because it is a process sometimes
8:53
sometimes for me i have been able to very easily say okay i can clearly see how this is going to be a trilogy so i'm going to write
8:59
three books but with my first series the shadow demon saga which used to be called the
9:05
peachful high demon saga i thought it was going to be a trilogy when i first started it i didn't have a lot of experience planning series i
9:12
didn't really know what i was doing and i thought well it'll be cool to write a trilogy and then i'll move on to something else
9:17
but as i started writing the story began to grow and i started to understand okay this is definitely going to be six
9:24
books then by the time i hit book six and sort of completed a series arc i knew that this was really
9:31
just the beginning of my story world and so i elongated that series and now it has grown into 12 books with
9:38
multiple spin-offs so i didn't have all of that planned from the start
9:43
i didn't know i was basically just flying by the seat of my pants and allowing
9:49
the story world to develop however it needed to develop like i've said in the
9:54
beginning and in the intro i hope to be able to take the experience that i've had over the last 10 years
10:00
writing that series and get even better at planning and that's the thing about being a writer
10:06
and a creator is it's okay to trust your instincts i think where people go wrong is when
10:11
they say well i think i'm gonna make more money if i write a six book series so i'm gonna take this little tiny kernel of an
10:17
idea and it doesn't even excite me but i'm gonna make it into a six book series and then you try to force it into
10:23
something that it's not now later in this video series we are going to talk about the emotional toll
10:29
of a series so trust me and please please hear me when i tell you that it's not worth it
10:36
to take on a long series just because you think you're going to make a lot of money writing it it's an emotional process to
10:43
dedicate so much of your life especially if you are an emotional person like i am an emotional creator
10:49
you really are going to pour so much of yourself into the writing of the series you are going to
10:54
become these characters in some ways they are going to live inside your head and inside your heart
11:00
for potentially decades to come so make sure that whatever you're writing you're not just forcing something onto the page
11:06
to try to make money and i know that there are people that will disagree with me and say well i'm writing for money and i don't care
11:12
and that's fine you're not the person i'm talking to the person that i'm talking to is someone who is writing because you love it
11:19
please choose something that sparks imagination for you that you think i could live with this for a while and
11:25
then trust yourself that you're going to get it done and that it's going to be something fulfilling for you the next question that i want to address
11:32
that i get to ask all the time and that i ask myself frankly is how much of the series do you
11:38
need to have planned before you start writing this is a tough one because the more you can
11:46
plan out often the better because you're going to be able to
11:51
especially when we get into talking about actually publishing this series the more you have an idea of which
11:58
characters you're going to be featuring and what story arc it is and how many books the more you'll be able to plan out the
12:04
marketing type packaging things like how many covers am i going to need how many titles am i going to have to brand
12:10
just right or what's my publishing strategy going to be and that sort of thing
12:15
also if you have a plan before you get started and you know how many books it's going to take for
12:21
your character to defeat the big bad then you can really go through and plan out all the
12:27
little breadcrumbs all the little twists and turns in the story exactly where you want to
12:33
put those clues in and you can really the same way that you plot your individual books you could plot out
12:41
those major points of realization and turning points and character change and plants and reveals you could
12:48
do all of that stuff so much stronger because you've planned out all five to ten books or whatever it is
12:54
ahead of time however it doesn't always work like this and this is one of the main things i
13:00
hope you take away from this whole series but also from my channel in general is that you are whoever you are
13:08
and you can get better as a writer you will most certainly learn the more you write the more you
13:14
publish the more you will learn about how to be a great writer but you also have to understand
13:21
who you are fundamentally and what your own personal strengths and weaknesses are some people will be great at planning
13:29
all those things ahead they will be able to write out every single detail like i have a friend who writes romantic suspense and she can
13:36
tell you the backstory of the hero that's coming up six books from now she knows the navy seals in her team and
13:43
she knows everything about them including who their father was and all of that sort of thing and she has it all planned
13:48
out so that when she's writing any little scene with that character five books before his book you know
13:54
before his feature book she can already be planting in his personality and all these things that
14:00
you need to know about him it's a brilliant and beautiful thing to watch and i wish i could be more like that
14:06
however what i found personally is that if i plan too far ahead too much minutia too much
14:12
detail i was really kind of just wasting time and wasting energy because what would inevitably
14:19
happen in my personal writing experience and process
14:24
is that when i sit down for example to write book 11 of this series things will inevitably turn out
14:31
differently than i expect and this is just part of my personal writing experience and i have a
14:36
feeling some of you might relate to this as well i cannot plan exactly where things are going because
14:43
part of the inspiration of my process is that the twists become revealed to me
14:48
as i write i can't pre-plan them they're as much of a surprise to me as they are to the readers and
14:55
this is one of the reasons why my readers call me the queen of twists because i have a lot of twists in my
15:01
shadow demon saga that you don't see coming well guess what i never saw them coming either and i think that if i try to manipulate them
15:07
and plan them too far in advance which i have tried many many times it always writes differently than i
15:13
expect my characters tend to have a mind of their own i have tried many many times to like but
15:19
this is how it's gonna go i'm gonna try to write it exactly this way but if it just doesn't flow on the
15:25
paper i have to just give it up and say okay muse you take over now and it becomes this more mystical
15:33
process and i know that sounds crazy to some people but it's almost as if the story exists
15:38
outside of me and i'm just the one trying to discover it you know like find
15:43
it but i am not the one creating it because i cannot force that story to be whatever i wanted it to be my friend who
15:50
writes the romantic suspense she doesn't force her story she just sees them differently than i do
15:56
she can see them more clearly ahead of time and they just unfold the way that she wants to she stays flexible if things
16:03
change but she very rarely has things come out of the blue that she has to replot and so what i
16:11
would find is if i would plot four or five books in advance i would get to the first book in my
16:17
plotting and the whole story would change and because i'm writing a dynamic series where book two depends on what
16:23
happened in book one the minute everything changes in book one that means every other books like domino's falling
16:30
down every other book has to change then i would just have to go back through and replot all of those books and it's just waste
16:37
of months of time so for me what i have learned to do instead is
16:42
i have a rough sketch of an idea of where these characters are going and what i think is going to happen
16:48
but i also have an emotional understanding of the fact that when i sit down to write book 10 or book 11 or
16:55
whatever book i'm on the story is going to change and i have to surrender to that and be okay with it
17:01
so when it comes to how much of your story do you need to have planned this is going to be something that you
17:07
need to discover for yourself and i know this might not be the answer you wanted to hear
17:13
but what i would suggest for you is you take the workbook or you write you start a new notebook of your own
17:18
and you start writing out your ideas and you say okay here's kind of the main story idea the
17:24
main series arc how many books can i you know write out these ideas or if you've got a detective
17:30
mystery how many mysteries could i imagine him solving and then you just start sketching out those ideas and
17:35
see what pops into your mind if you are naturally someone who is going
17:41
to get all the ideas and have everything planned out and your world is built and all the magic system is coming to you
17:47
then it will come and you will be able to write it all down and capture it and plan it out as much to your heart's
17:53
content if you sit down and nothing is coming to you then maybe you're more like me and
17:59
you just have to write it and get it on the page to discover it the main thing you need to do in my opinion is just listen to
18:06
yourself trust yourself don't try to force anything that isn't coming
18:11
but also don't get so obsessed with trying to make it perfect and trying to
18:17
figure out every single detail that you never start writing because procrasti planning is a real
18:22
thing and it's a real thing when it comes to your series as well you could spend
18:29
months if not years planning out your little town and your magic system and this person owns the grocery store and
18:35
this guy's the doctor and this girl lives next to him and all these things you could have all of this plotted out
18:40
and you could be thinking about characters hair color and who's going to have babies together or here's the magic system and here's the
18:46
color of the dresses these women wear but none of it's going to mean anything if you never actually sit down to write
18:52
those books so there's got to be a balance there listen to yourself listen to your own intuition
18:57
have a way to capture the ideas as they come in be it a notebook or a series bible
19:05
or some kind of brainstorming thing it could be a google doc however it is have a way that you capture these notes
19:12
and make sure you keep track of it but stay flexible enough that you are allowed to change
19:18
your mind if your series progresses in a way other than what you expected how much you plan ahead also depends on
19:25
the complexity of the series so like i said if you're writing short contemporary romances that are all based
19:31
on a family it might be easier to sort of plan things out because there's six brothers and sisters so therefore there will be
19:38
six books and you know exactly who this brother is going to get together with and this sister is going to get together with
19:43
this guy and once you have that sort of plotted out then you can easily go in and you can start sketching out ideas for what's
19:50
going to be the conflict what are these people's personalities what's their wound you know you can start going through those character sheets and
19:56
figuring out that romance plus romance has a specific type of structure to it usually so
20:02
maybe you can go through and begin to plan that but if you're writing a fantasy world that's going to have 250
20:08
000 word books and you know there's going to be 12 books in the series and you're going across multiple dimensions
20:15
and lots of different races of people and a very intricate magic system then you're going to have a
20:22
much more complex job when it comes to planning out your series than someone who's setting it in
20:27
a contemporary world with a limited number of characters so it's not good or bad either way it's
20:33
just one might be easier to plan ahead whereas the other one is going to take more time so just give
20:39
it the time that it needs and like i said if you can't see all the details don't let that stop you
20:45
from getting started because you might find that as you begin to write some of these answers
20:50
about the world itself and the types of characters and the story you're telling might come to you in the writing so a
20:56
similar question to this is how much of your series should you have written before you start publishing but
21:03
we're not going to discuss that in this video because that is too long of a topic if you're interested in that topic
21:08
however i do have a video linked for you down below about should you rapid release which does talk a little bit
21:14
about publishing strategy i also just happened to open up my publish and thrive course it
21:21
just opened up today and we'll be starting on august 10th we cover a lot more of that publishing
21:26
strategy in that course so if you're interested in that kind of discussion definitely check that out so in terms of how much you
21:33
have written before you start publishing it's really going to be your decision there is no one way
21:38
that's best because each way you decide to do it is going to have pros and cons it's just what works best for you and
21:44
what do you want to do and if you think well maybe i kind of want to try it this way then go for it try it the best way to
21:50
learn what works for you is to try different things so don't hold yourself back or feel like you just need
21:55
a crystal ball to figure it out because spoiler alert no crystal ball is going to appear before you and give you all
22:02
the answers as to what's best for you the only way you can learn what works for you is to try it and see
22:08
if you try it and it doesn't work for you try it a different way now the next set of questions that
22:13
you'll need to answer and how you're going to actually plan out all of these things
22:18
that go along with your story is something that i will guide you through in this workbook
22:24
so for the second half of this video i am going to turn my camera down so you can actually see
22:29
this workbook and i'm going to walk you through some of the ways that i would suggest you plan and make these
22:34
decisions about your series and how you can use this workbook to plot out all those story threads how
22:40
you're going to figure out your entire series and so on and i will give you some examples of how i would do it with my
22:47
own series so let's move to the top down view okay you guys so in this second part of the
22:53
video we're gonna actually just kind of walk through the free how to plan and write your series
22:58
workbook that i have available for newsletter subscribers so make sure you go and sign up for my newsletter to get this for free
23:04
this is something that i put together to help kind of guide you through the entire planning process for your
23:11
series and as i was creating this i already saw so many ways that i can make it better so if you start using this
23:16
yourself and you start to say oh you know what i would love if i had this type of page or this kind of
23:22
reference or if it asks these kinds of questions please feel free to reach out and email me because i am definitely
23:27
interested in making this an even better resource so consider this a first draft of the series workbook
23:34
also i realized as i was putting this on a white surface that you couldn't really
23:39
see it very well so i just threw down some tissue paper that i've been using in my book signings
23:44
so just ignore the way that looks it's just a little bit of a backdrop to make it pop a little more okay so the series
23:51
workbook starts out basically with a message from me and then a questionnaire and the questionnaire is
23:57
really a way for you to start examining the decisions that you're going to make
24:03
as you plan now some of this depending on where you are in the planning process is just going to flow right out of you
24:09
and some of it you might think oh my gosh i don't even know yet but my goal with this first part of the workbook is really to get you thinking
24:15
along the right direction so brainstorming this is really about digging deep and saying
24:21
what type of series am i writing what kind of characters am i going to have what type of type of world is this so hopefully these questions will get
24:27
you on that path so the first question is really just asking you which type of series are you
24:33
writing a dynamic a standalone or an episodic and if you aren't sure what those terms mean head down to the link below and watch
24:39
the first video in this series on these three types of series
24:44
because when do you identify what you're writing that's going to really play into and influence a lot of
24:51
the decisions that you make from here on out then i want you to take some time to journal and explain
24:56
the type of series you want or plan to write and why you believe it fits into one of these categories so for example if you think
25:04
yours is standalone just do a little bit of journaling here about you know i really want to write the type of series that readers can jump
25:10
in on on book five and still enjoy it and i have this idea for a great detective that they're going to follow all the way through
25:16
so just something like that where you really explain why this is the type of series you want
25:22
to write then i want you to on the next page list as many series
25:27
as you can think of that have similar elements to yours or to what your idea is or write out a bunch of series that
25:35
inspire you in some way so this doesn't even have to be your exact genre but maybe it has elements that
25:41
inspire you and you can draw from books film television you can draw from games that
25:47
you've played or any other type of story or event it could be youtube channels it could be anything but
25:53
just list as many things that you can think of so you might say like oh i really loved playing resident evil and
25:59
so i kind of want to write something where there's this developed virus and you've got this one
26:04
kind of badass character who is gonna you know follow through the whole series of trying to defeat this
26:10
big organization so you might write down what resident evil was and why it
26:15
inspires you and why you think it's like yours and just do that for as many things as you can think of
26:21
then choose one of those things you listed and explain how it's similar to your idea
26:26
and what elements inspire you the most about it this is really just prompts to get you thinking about what type of
26:32
series you're writing and why you're adding in the elements that you're adding in then
26:37
in this next section you're gonna answer the question what genre would you place your series into
26:43
or what subcategory within that genre if applicable for an example of this would be like okay your primary genre might be
26:50
horror but the subgenre or subcategory might be a haunted house horror or a monster horror or zombie horror or
26:58
something like that so it's really important to start to identify what genre you're going to be
27:03
in now there are some things like romantic suspense that might belong in a romance category as well as a suspense
27:11
and thriller category and that's fine but you should be able to identify a pro like one single primary genre that
27:18
you would fit yourself into and remember that like y a is not a genre that's more of a category
27:24
so what genre within y a are you writing why a paranormal why a contemporary so make sure that you
27:31
drill down as closely as you can and like i said you don't have to have all of the answers figured out but this
27:37
should give you a good idea then does this genre and subcategory line up with the examples
27:44
that you listed over here so if you wrote a bunch of why a contemporary stuff over here but this
27:50
over here has a bunch of urban fantasy or fantasy maybe ask yourself like if
27:55
i'm so interested in fantasy why am i writing a contemporary ya so this might just give you a little bit
28:00
more insight into what you really want to be writing then i have a little bit of a note down here
28:06
for you that's basically saying that it's a balance while it's always important to follow
28:12
your heart and write stories that you love it's also worthwhile to think about your intended audience before you start writing so a
28:19
lot of this that you've done in this early part of the workbook is really identifying reader expectations
28:25
what genre does this fit into and what type of reader expectations are there within this genre
28:30
i also want you to be thinking about reader expectations to a degree as you continue to work through the
28:36
workbook now obviously you want to write the story that you
28:41
want to write the story that's in your heart so that's why i say it's a balance you can't be writing it solely for a
28:47
reader or an agent or a publishing house because you want to put a piece of yourself into it and you want to write
28:53
the things that you're interested in however there are ways that stories are told
28:58
time and time again and if you're going to step outside of reader expectation you need to be aware of how and why
29:05
you're doing it a lot of times when people are talking to me about their series or i've been doing coaching with people
29:11
one of the main things that or mistakes they make i would say when they start to really think and plan
29:16
their series is they're like i'm going to do something different than what anybody's ever done before the first book is going to be a
29:22
romance but the second one's going to be a thriller and the third one is going to be y a and it's like okay you know those
29:29
are all good ideas but when you start thinking about a reader and the way stories are told that is
29:35
very non-traditional and while non-traditional can work you need to be aware before you
29:41
do something that is so radical that it might not be something that really fits into the market
29:46
especially if you're trying to sell this to a traditional publisher you need to understand
29:52
market trends you need to understand at least the basics of simple things
29:58
like if you're writing a small town romance how are those stories normally told what tense are they
30:04
how many points of view are there usually and the more you can fall into what those like reader
30:11
expectations are for your chosen genre the more successful you're likely to be
30:16
i always say this with you know take it with a grain of salt because if you have an idea that's radical but that you
30:22
want to do it i mean think about george rr martin and how much he revolutionized you know fantasy with some of his game
30:28
of thrones and and the books in that song of ice and fire series you can break the rules
30:34
but it's always better in my opinion to break the rules because you are doing it on purpose and you know because then you
30:40
can do it with skill rather than doing it with no skill i don't know i don't want to say it in a
30:45
mean way but just make sure you understand these things so hopefully these questions get you moving in the right direction and know
30:52
that the further you deviate from what readers expect what else has been
30:58
done you know like tell your story the way you want to tell it or tell the the story you want to tell but the more
31:04
you tell it in a different way or in a way that no one else has done before the more you're taking a risk i think
31:10
that's the best way i can say it so in the next section you're looking at characters and points of view
31:16
so you're gonna have many characters in your story but what tense are you writing it and
31:21
what type of point of view are you writing it so how many point of view characters do you plan to have in your series like how
31:28
many people are you going to be actually in their head telling from their point of view then will each
31:34
book feature the same pov character or characters or will each book be different so with a small town romance or a
31:42
paranormal romance for example you would usually have one couple per book and you would
31:47
usually in a lot of instances have the hero and the heroine or the two different characters who are
31:54
going to be falling in love would be the pov characters in young adult fantasy or most urban
32:01
fantasy you're typically just gonna have that one main character who is the pov character throughout but
32:09
there of course are exceptions and so you need to understand how you're doing it what the norm is
32:14
how you're deviating from the norm and start thinking about that so how many pov characters do you have and does each
32:20
book feature the same pov character or is every book different and how will that pov work then what
32:27
tense do you plan to write in so the most obvious ones are like third person past tense first person present tense or
32:34
first person past tense and you need to think about that and understand what those tenses are and then make the
32:40
choice if you guys want to see a video on how to choose the best tense for your story please comment down
32:46
below like this video and subscribe and let me know and i can put together a video on tense and pov as well because in my
32:54
different series i have written in just about everything my fair hope series is a new adult romance that's written in
32:59
first person present tense my shadow demon saga is written with four povs in first person past
33:05
tense and then my eternal sorrows series has eight third-person povs
33:11
and sometimes you might be writing in a more omniscient point of view so just understand the different points
33:16
of view and how you're going to use them in your story on this final page here of this section
33:22
i've given you a lot of room to list the main pov characters you know of so far along with anything you already know
33:29
about them and you can list more than just the pov characters here you can also list side characters if you have room and you want to start working
33:35
through that so you could list their appearance their backstory their characteristics their personality their family ties how they
33:42
fit into the story that you know all of those things you could go ahead and start filling out and of course you could print this multiple times if you want to
33:48
write many different characters the next section we have here is setting and world building
33:54
so in what time and place does the beginning of your series occur and describe this place in detail so are
34:01
you working in with a real world setting here where it's just set in contemporary you know italy or contemporary america
34:08
or a fictional small town but that's basically based on reality
34:13
or are you in a completely different fantasy world or maybe you're in like an alternate version chicago or
34:19
maybe you're setting your book in 1865 in england you need to understand the
34:24
where and the when and then finally like what type of world is this real world
34:30
are there speculative elements within our world or are you just in a fantasy world and this is where you're
34:36
going to start figuring all of that out so again is this a real world setting or are there fantasy
34:41
paranormal or speculative elements explain will your story be primarily set in the same location
34:48
throughout each book so over here i was asking about the beginning of your series so will your story be set in the same
34:54
location throughout each book or are there multiple settings list these locations
34:59
and what you know about them so far now this is not really a place to list okay they're in the book shop and
35:04
then they're in the house it's more like okay they're in this town or this world or this village
35:11
and there's going to be a place later to list out the different like shops or locations they go to within that place
35:17
so this is more like on a bigger scale you could even say this is the country they're in and now i'm going to kind of break it
35:23
down into cities this would also be a place where you could say that your book might be taking place
35:30
over multiple decades or in different centuries or however you're going to put that together
35:36
here is on the next page another little note about something to consider is that i always find it helpful to
35:41
sketch out a rough map of some of the main locations so you know if you have a main street and you
35:47
want to kind of sketch out what the different shops are there and that they're going to turn left to get back to the house
35:52
so that you always are consistent and you have a clear picture in your mind of what the town looks like or what the
35:58
country and the terrain looks like oh there's you know especially if you're doing a fantasy series there's mountains to the east and
36:04
there's an ocean to the west and you know you can sketch all of that out i
36:09
actually also put a resource in the back because there are several places online where you can sketch out a map like
36:16
online and on a website so that's kind of cool as well i know that there are several authors who
36:22
friends of mine have actually commissioned maps from artists that they put in their books which i think is super cool and i really want to do that
36:28
too so in the space below consider listing out the locations like the stores the
36:34
neighborhoods the terrains that you need to make room for in your map so you can take out a blank sheet
36:39
of paper and you can begin sketching that out but here you can use this space to actually
36:44
list the different places that you want to add to your map series arc this is the next section so
36:51
as you think about your series can you imagine several different story lines or conflicts that your characters will face
36:57
over multiple books use the space below to brainstorm why you believe you have enough content for
37:03
a series so you could talk about how you're going to have a different mystery in each book and it's a standalone series or you could
37:09
say um you know this journey that my character is going to take is going to take them three years so each book is
37:16
going to be a year of their life so kind of sketch out how that series arc is going to work here in
37:22
this section in terms of a series arc or tie-in how will your novels be connected will you
37:28
have that overarching storyline or is there something else that will tie these books together
37:33
and explain so if you go back to video number two if you haven't watched that yet in this series i talk about the
37:39
difference between character arcs story arcs and series arc so that's what we're talking about here
37:44
will your series have an overarching storyline that takes place over the course of the whole series or
37:50
is there just a more loose tie-in that's like a relationship interconnection or is it going to be basically no
37:57
overarching series arc and every book could stand alone but it all has the same detective so there's lots of options here and this
38:03
is just a place for you to start brainstorming that how many books do you think you will need to tell this story
38:09
or if you're writing a standalone series how many books do you anticipate wanting to write or will you keep it open open-ended so
38:15
that you could just add more and more books if you can sketch out a rough idea of each conflict your characters will face
38:22
or each couple if you're writing a romance so again this is not like set in stone and you write this down and
38:28
now it's permanent this is just a place for you to start brainstorming okay you know i know they start this you know they start here when he
38:36
ends up at this college and i know we're going to take him through all four years of college and then in the final year of college he's
38:42
finally going to meet the woman he loves so i'm going to write four books i think and that's how long it's gonna take
38:47
or okay we've got this big villain that we need to face but it's gonna take my character
38:52
several books to grow big enough or strong enough or to gather the skills of maturity to defeat this villain so
38:58
i think it's going to take them six books and you're just kind of guessing at this point but i want you to
39:04
make an educated guess where you start to think through what are the possible story lines that i might follow here and how long do i
39:10
think it's going to take or if you're writing romances you might say okay i'm going to have a pack of
39:15
werewolves how many are going to be in this pack and how many stories do i think i want to tell so you can make those decisions ahead of
39:21
time so that you can start writing those other characters into the early books so that readers get
39:26
connected to those characters early on okay so this next half of the planner is
39:32
really your series planner and this is where you're going to be kind of customizing your own sheets so
39:38
let me show you how it works so the first part was the series questionnaire and in this section you're
39:43
going to have a series or series arc planner a books and story arc planner a breadcrumbs or story threads tracker
39:50
characters and a character arc planner world building worksheet for a contemporary world and a world building
39:56
worksheet for a speculative or fantasy world again keep in mind that you don't have
40:02
to have all the answers yet this you can print these out you can pick and scratch all over this you can
40:07
delete it you can recycle it you can do whatever you want to do but this hopefully will get you thinking in the right direction so we have a
40:14
series overview page that's pretty self-explanatory you're going to list your genre your subcategory your main
40:19
pov characters the tents that you're using so these are all decisions you made in the questionnaire
40:25
and then i want you to list what elements are tying this series together is it all set in the same town is it set with the same family is it the
40:32
same detective or a villain that is overarching what is the glue that connects this series and makes
40:38
it a series so then you have a series arc sort of worksheet and i've done three of these
40:43
so one is for a dynamic series one is for romance series and one is for a mystery
40:49
series obviously there's only room for two books on each of these so if you think you're going to have six books you'll
40:54
want to print this out three times and you can really customize it in this way so basically i ask for your book title
41:01
and your book number on the dynamic series one i'm asking what's the main story question so
41:06
what's the question that your reader is going to ask by the end of the first act like will harper fit in or will she get sent
41:14
to juvenile detention or who killed tory fairchild those are the types of main story questions that
41:21
should be answered by the end of this this one book how does
41:26
this book connect to the overarching series story line so with a dynamic
41:32
series you have to have that overarching story line so how does this book fit in with that so you might say something like this is
41:38
the first book where harper moves to peachville this is the one that sets it up and she discovers that there are witches
41:44
in this town and that's the only part she knows about the overarching storyline
41:49
other bread crumbs are threads that are woven into this book so these are just like story threads that your reader's
41:54
not going to have the complete picture of yet but they're going to get little clues or you're going to be dropping breadcrumbs
42:01
leading them down a path so this is where you just sort of roughly sketch that out so for example in my book beautiful demons
42:08
one of the breadcrumbs is that harper discovers a picture of her mother and is she's pretty sure that her mother must
42:14
have lived in this town so i could put picture of her mother another breadcrumb could be that jackson
42:19
says that he's bound to an oath older than time so what is this oath what is he talking about um so
42:26
those types of things you can just add in what types of breadcrumbs or threads you think are going to be
42:31
woven into this book how does the main character grow in this particular book and how does
42:38
that relate to the overall series and then the resolution what's the resolution to this
42:44
first book and what's the lead in to the next book if applicable and you would fill this out of course
42:49
the lead-in thing so you might say the resolution is she discovers who killed tori and she gets admitted onto the demon's
42:57
cheerleading squad and the lead-in is that now there are all these mysteries as to what's
43:02
going to happen once she gets invited into this inner circle of cheerleaders so
43:08
that's the lead into the next book obviously when you get to the final book of the series there won't be a lead in
43:13
but i've given you space for two books on each page in the romance series one we have the
43:19
same type of setup but it's conflict conflict or plot overview who's the couple why do they resist each
43:26
other what's their conflict between each other what they're each going to overcome so like what's their wound what's their
43:32
inner struggle and then what's the resolution obviously depending on the type of romance series
43:37
and if it's darker or you know lighter or whatever it is you might need to alter this a little bit
43:42
for yourself but hopefully this will give you an idea of how to structure that for the mystery series it's very similar
43:47
so what's the mystery who's the villain kind of who did who done it what are the clues and twists that
43:53
you're going to find in this book and then what's the resolution so if you have an overarching series arc
44:01
in your mystery series so maybe it's like an episodic mystery series you would also in the clues and twists
44:07
or the resolution you would want to put like how does this book tie into the overarching series as well
44:15
i have a story arc worksheet for you here which very briefly kind of walks you through just some of the main plot
44:20
points obviously if you want to go deeper into the plotting of each individual story arc or each individual book you will go
44:28
and get my how to plot your novel workbook from the same resource library that you get when you
44:34
sign up for my mailing list and i have this much more detailed in terms of the actual plot so you're going to kind of touch on plot
44:40
here in the front what's the book title and what's the book number who are the main characters what's the inciting or key
44:46
event what's the first doorway what's the midpoint what's the black moment and what's the resolution of the story
44:52
then you're gonna also ask yourself how does this story's arc or action connect
44:57
to the rest of the series so if it's a romance you might say well this story's action this romance
45:03
connects to the next book because the hero of this book is the brother of the hero of the next book and you would put
45:08
that in here explain how your characters grow in this book so how does how what's this character arc
45:15
of these characters and how does that relate to the next book and then any other notes that you want
45:21
to put in here so is this going to be something that's fast-paced what what other notes might you want to
45:27
put in here about how this story connects or what type of cliffhanger or what type of new characters you're
45:34
going to introduce in this book and so this is per book and what you would want to do is if you have seven books in your
45:40
series you would want to fill this out seven different times so just print it seven times
45:46
i have a story threads sheet for you here as well and this is one of the fun
45:51
things i think about writing a series especially one that's a dynamic series so describe the story thread or related
45:57
subplots so this could be a subplot this could also just be kind of small breadcrumbs like an undercurrent running in the background
46:04
that gets stronger with each one it may not be a fully fledged subplot in books one and two but maybe by
46:10
book three it becomes a subplot and then maybe by book four and five it becomes the main plot and it's just something that's been
46:16
brewing throughout so describe the story thread or related subplot so what is it so for example i
46:22
mentioned harper's mother so i'm gonna say story thread is what really happened to harper's mother
46:28
then in the chart below make notes about how this particular thread is carried through or mentioned in each
46:34
book so what breadcrumbs are you leaving behind how is it mentioned how does it affect the story so i would write book number
46:41
and i would write one here and then in this space provided i would write something like the only thing harper ever got from her
46:46
mother who she never met was this necklace and then i would mention how the necklace plays a role in this book
46:52
as well as she finds a photograph of her mother and someone mentions this photograph so i would put that here
46:59
as book one in book two how am i going to advance that part of the story so what little
47:05
piece of that thread am i gonna weave through book two so the necklace becomes important yet again
47:11
we find out a little bit more about her mother but we still don't have the answer as to what really happened to her
47:16
mother so we move to book three and we say okay this is where it really comes to a head
47:21
because this is where she finds out what really happened to her mother and where her mother is
47:26
and then in book for this and in book five this so you would just copy all those little threads and like i
47:31
said you may not have all the answers here but this will give you an opportunity to write out all those different story
47:37
threads that you want to track and keep track of them so you don't forget when you get to book four that oh yeah i need to
47:43
weave that in even if it's just a couple of mentions here and there i've given you space to do five books on
47:50
this sheet so of course if you have more than five books you'll want to print it multiple times
47:55
and you will also want to print out this story thread sheet for each of your story threads so this is not your main
48:01
plot this is going to be something that is like woven through until it becomes a bigger part of the story so what happened to harper's
48:08
mother another one might be jackson can see the future what's going on with jackson's images that he can
48:14
draw and how does that play into each book so you might have you know a dozen or half a dozen
48:19
story threads that you're weaving through depending on the complexity of your series so you'll want to print out one of these pages
48:25
or multiple of these pages depending on how many books and how many story threads you have
48:32
i also created a character arc sheet for you here where you have similar things to what i put in your character arc on your how to plot a
48:38
novel but it goes a little different so you've got name a little bit of details and appearance notes then what is your character's
48:44
wound or ghost what do they believe what's that lie they believe about themselves and we talked about this in the previous video
48:50
at the beginning of the series they are what they are cynical they believe they're
48:56
not worth anything they're in trouble with school where are they both emotionally and physically at
49:02
the beginning of the series by the end of the series not just the end of this book but by the end of the
49:07
series they have transformed to become what now of course if you're writing standalone romances your character is
49:14
going to actually transform within that book not the whole series so you want to kind of alter this for
49:19
a romance that says self-contained romance but when you have a character arc that
49:25
progresses over the course of multiple books this will help you so at the beginning of the series they're like
49:30
lost they're they doubt themselves they're not very strong they've just started to realize they have powers but
49:36
by the end of the series they're going to be super strong they're going to have lots of friends they're going to know their skills they're going to be
49:41
confident in themselves you know whatever it is what's the transformation then i have a little section here
49:46
similar to the breadcrumbs where i've given you space for five books and in the chart below i want you
49:52
to map out a brief explanation of what events in the storyline cause your character to grow and evolve
49:57
as well as notes on how they've changed so like in book number one the catalyst or event might be that
50:03
harper goes to the town of peachville
50:09
and is welcomed on to the cheerleading squad and her character growth here is that
50:14
she finally believes for the first time in her life that someone cares about her but she
50:20
also knows that she's getting in with people that might not be
50:25
good people so she's desperate at the beginning to be loved and to fit in but she's sort
50:32
of getting in over her head and she realizes this might not be where she really wants to be
50:37
book two the catalyst or event you know would be something else and what does how does she grow from that so you can
50:43
explain that and you might have multiple catalysts and points of growth throughout each book but this gives you again
50:48
space for five books so if you need more you can just print this out multiple times
50:54
i also have for you here a world building worksheet for a real world setting so what's the main town or setting of
51:02
this book what type of place is this and so this is of course you could do it per book or
51:07
you could do it for the whole series but what type of place is this it is small town a big city a factory
51:13
town give me as many details as you can list any important landmarks terrain special weather they have
51:20
special events they have anything you can think about this town or this the culture of this place is good to
51:25
list here then i've given you a lot of space here to also list the shops and buildings in the town and the characters who work
51:32
there so you might say the pharmacy and here's dr bob works there and this this and this and then you've also got the library and
51:39
here's who works there and any kind of defining characteristics because especially if you're setting like a real world setting
51:45
you obviously you don't have to mark any businesses that your characters aren't going into or that aren't going to take
51:50
place in your story but anything you could see your characters interacting with it's good to have a
51:56
record of that and we're going to talk about this more in the next video coming up on how to create a series bible but this is a good
52:01
place to get started with it then you also have a spot here to list any other recurring characters in the
52:07
town and their traits so this is a great place to list any kind of quirky side characters or
52:12
characters that might become future heroes and heroines or even the villain of your town so this is this is good so you could
52:19
actually list a lot of them you're probably going to list a lot of them in relation to the shops and buildings
52:24
so you can decide if you want to use this for more shops and buildings or if you want to just use this for characters
52:30
that aren't necessarily tied to a location like a shop but this is more like okay
52:35
so-and-so's mother shows up in the story many times and that sort of thing so additional notes on this story world
52:42
again i would also encourage you to sketch out a map of this location
52:48
then i have a longer sort of journaling
52:54
brainstorming section here for a fantasy or speculative element world so what's the main setting
52:59
what type of place is this list any important landmarks all that is the same but what do you know about the people who
53:06
live in this place make notes on special creatures or races their appearance their history their
53:11
skills their clothing their language and more so this is where i feel like oh my gosh i could really do a lot more with this
53:17
but it's hard to get it all into one planner so i've got a note for you on that in the back so make notes on any special
53:24
magic or technology found in this world be as specific as you can regarding how these things work what are the rules that govern them
53:31
how do they appear when they're used and what are any consequences to their use like okay you can use this wand in order to
53:39
cast a spell but every time you cast a spell you get a little bit of a headache or you use up
53:45
some of your stamina what are the rules and the magic rules now obviously i'm not guiding you too
53:50
closely here but hopefully this will be a good jumping off point for thinking about the technology or how the magic
53:55
works in your world notes on elements you will pull from from true history
54:00
science or technology and how will you stay true to these or how will you alter the truth or weave it into your fantasy
54:06
so even if you're in a separate world you might be pulling things from the world we know now you might be
54:12
pulling some of your fantasy the way the castles look or anything like that from medieval england so
54:18
write out anything you're using you if you're writing an alternate history what pieces of history are you changing and
54:24
what are you keeping the same this is a good place to brainstorm that and then the final question is what type
54:29
of conflicts or challenges exist in this world and are these pulled from our modern world
54:34
how do they how do different creatures races or organizations interact with each other and what rules or laws exist
54:40
this is really where that government type stuff comes in and this is really just the beginning to world building
54:45
so over here i have a resource list for you as well okay you guys i know this was a longer video but hopefully
54:51
this is going to be super helpful for you in planning your own series if you would like to see
54:57

58:35
you
writing a series is so rewarding and so
0:03
much fun it's also hands down one of the
0:07
best ways to build a career and a loyal
0:10
readership and income as an indie author
0:14
however
0:15
it's much more complicated than writing
0:18
stand-alone novels and there's not as
0:22
many resources out there that teach you
0:24
how to plan and you get ready for
0:26
writing a series so that's what we're
0:28
going to talk about here today is how do
0:31
you plan for nanowrimo or any time of
0:33
year when you are writing a series so
0:35
let's get started
0:41
so we are here in my witchy writing room
0:44
where everything is a little bit
0:46
spookified because I will be celebrating
0:48
coming up in the next few weeks a
0:51
Spooktacular celebration which is a
0:53
yearly celebration in my fan group for
0:56
the birthday of my first book beautiful
0:58
demons that came out in 2010 so this
1:01
will be the 12 year anniversary we start
1:03
on Wednesday if you want to come join us
1:04
there will be over a thousand dollars in
1:06
prizes and daily like twitch streams and
1:09
just all kinds of stuff so come join us
1:11
if you want that's over at
1:12
sarahcannon.com and basically when I
1:16
first started that that very first book
1:18
beautiful demons I knew that I wanted to
1:21
write a series but when I went looking
1:22
for all my precious craft books there
1:26
really were not a lot of resources about
1:29
how to plan and write a series how much
1:31
do you need to have planned ahead of
1:33
time does it have to be you know
1:35
consistent does it have to be something
1:37
that I know know every single detail of
1:39
the whole series before I can start
1:41
writing and what I learned was those
1:44
types of resources just didn't exist and
1:46
there are some that have come on the
1:48
market since then but there's still a
1:50
real lack when it comes to series
1:51
planning and so I wanted to address if
1:55
you were doing nanowrimo since we're in
1:57
the midst of preptober or you're getting
1:59
ready to write a book that is part of a
2:01
series what are some of the things that
2:03
you might want to take into
2:04
consideration that are different than if
2:06
you were planning a standalone
2:08
so there are kind of two situations that
2:10
you might find yourself in you're either
2:12
writing book one of a series where
2:14
you're making all those decisions about
2:16
what type of a series what is the world
2:18
what are the characters what's the genre
2:20
and you're building those foundations or
2:22
you might be later in a series where the
2:25
foundation is set and there are some
2:27
past events and now you're trying to
2:29
figure out how to weave this next book
2:31
or how to decide what's going to happen
2:32
in this next book and how does it fit
2:34
into the rest of the series so we're
2:36
going to touch on each of these
2:38
scenarios today if it's your first book
2:41
in a series you're going to basically
2:43
take all of the information that you can
2:45
get out of craft books or previous
2:47
videos or stuff here on YouTube and you
2:50
can apply that to that first book but
2:52
you want to apply it with a vision
2:54
outward a long-term view of okay so
2:59
here's the foundation but how does that
3:01
carry on and you want to already be
3:04
thinking about what's gonna how is this
3:07
going to affect back to book two or book
3:09
three and so on so some of those
3:11
decisions are going to look like what
3:13
type of series are you writing
3:16
are you writing a dynamic Series where
3:18
it has to be read in order and it's
3:20
really one large like overarching story
3:24
that unfolds over multiple volumes or
3:27
are you writing a standalone Series
3:29
where each book is completely
3:31
self-contained but is a series connected
3:34
by something that gives them that
3:36
connection like a group of friends or a
3:39
Navy SEAL Team or a detective following
3:42
all these different cases or maybe
3:44
romances something like that so once you
3:47
decide what type of series you're
3:49
writing you need to also think about
3:50
what genre and the genre can help you
3:52
decide what type because there are like
3:54
in Romance you're usually looking at
3:56
Standalone Series in Mysteries a lot of
3:59
times you're looking at Standalone
4:01
series but in fantasy for example you're
4:03
often looking at that more Dynamic
4:05
Series so figuring out what genre you're
4:08
writing and what type of series can be
4:09
super important with that being said I
4:12
also wanted to say that if you're making
4:14
those decisions about where World
4:16
building and characters and government
4:18
and rules of your magic system and what
4:21
are the different you know story arcs
4:23
and story threads and stuff like that I
4:25
do have a series of videos here on
4:27
YouTube about how to plan and write a
4:29
series and of course as I do it comes
4:31
with a free workbook and this is an
4:33
almost 30 page workbook that has a lot
4:36
of
4:36
um questions in here and things to
4:38
consider about creating Maps or thinking
4:41
about what type of series and it
4:42
explains so it's different kinds of
4:44
Series so I'm going to link all that for
4:45
you down below so if you're on my
4:47
newsletter list just go to the HB
4:50
resource Library you got a link to it as
4:52
a reminder in Thursday's video that I
4:54
sent out this past week and find the
4:57
thing called how to plan and write a
4:59
series if you're not on my newsletter
5:01
list you can join at the link below and
5:03
you get access to all of those different
5:05
resources there's more than a dozen in
5:07
there so come and get it so because I go
5:09
over a lot of those foundational
5:10
decisions in that video series I'm not
5:13
going to go as deep into it right now so
5:15
one of the most common questions that I
5:18
get in terms of writing a series is how
5:20
much do I have to have planned out ahead
5:23
of time
5:24
well
5:25
the truth is there are no rules just
5:28
like we've talked about throughout this
5:29
preptober series every writer is an
5:31
individual and your process is going to
5:33
be individual to you when I first
5:35
started writing beautiful demons I
5:37
thought it was going to be a Trilogy and
5:39
I planned for it as such but then by the
5:41
time you get to book three I had already
5:44
gotten so many ideas for how much the
5:46
world is going to expand and I learned
5:49
so much more so by the end of book four
5:50
they're in a totally different realm
5:52
basically portal fantasy and then by the
5:55
end of book 10 the whole world is so
5:58
much bigger than I ever could have
5:59
imagined with book one and it has worked
6:02
out and it has been successful do I
6:04
think that a little bit more
6:06
pre-planning of how big the world was
6:09
going to get and just how big this
6:10
villain was gonna get would have helped
6:12
me absolutely but it still worked out
6:15
and I do think for me that if I had sat
6:18
down 10 12 years ago and said oh this is
6:21
what's going to happen in book one book
6:22
two book three book four book five and
6:24
had tried to plan it all out by book
6:26
three I would have been so far off what
6:29
I had planned that all of that
6:30
pre-planning would have been
6:32
wasted time so it's partially again just
6:37
like I've said over and over about
6:39
figuring out your own personal
6:40
preference and your own personal process
6:42
some writers are going to do much better
6:45
if they have things planned and they can
6:47
write just directly to that plan and
6:49
some people are just going to do better
6:51
if they discover the story as they go
6:54
however
6:55
there are some things for continuity's
6:58
sake and decisions that you can make up
7:00
front that are going to help you in this
7:02
foundational stage one of those is going
7:05
to be who is my ideal reader who am I
7:08
writing for and what kind of book are
7:10
they hoping to get what are they hoping
7:12
to feel every time they pick up a book
7:14
in this series because one of the big
7:16
mistakes that I see people make is they
7:19
think about this first book and then
7:21
they go to write the second book and
7:23
it's going to have a totally different
7:24
tone and then the third book again kind
7:26
of goes off the rails so let's say
7:28
you're writing a romance series and you
7:30
haven't decided like who's my ideal
7:32
reader and what type of emotions am I
7:34
trying to make them feel throughout the
7:35
series you might say okay the first book
7:38
is going to be this really fun
7:39
light-hearted comical like romance where
7:42
I'm gonna really make people laugh
7:43
there's going to be a lot of like meet
7:45
cute and lighthearted fun you know kind
7:48
of stuff but then in book two you want
7:50
to go into some really heavy deep stuff
7:53
and your heroine has a lot of trauma and
7:55
you've got got people crying and you're
7:56
pulling them through all these emotions
7:58
and then book three you want to bring a
8:00
witch into the story so now you've got
8:02
magic and you've got Mayhem and you've
8:04
got a villain and now we've got action
8:06
well that's like three completely
8:08
separate series and I'm not saying that
8:10
you can't do that because you really can
8:12
do whatever you want to do as a writer
8:15
however when you think about your ideal
8:18
reader most people pick up a series
8:21
because they know that this Series has a
8:24
core emotion or a core experience that
8:27
it's going to bring them through and so
8:29
for example with my Shadow Demon Saga
8:31
people pick up these books knowing that
8:33
they're gonna get found family they're
8:35
gonna get connection and they're going
8:37
to get action magic page turning twists
8:42
so if they were to pick up Book 12 and
8:44
it doesn't have those elements and it
8:45
doesn't make them feel the same way the
8:47
previous books were it's going to be
8:49
disappointing to them so you think about
8:51
your romance reader or your mystery
8:53
reader if you have book one is a gory
8:56
harsh like you know Noir type book you
9:00
want book two to have that same kind of
9:02
feel because people are going to be
9:04
learning that this is your style this is
9:06
the type of character this person is and
9:09
so having that consistency pre-planned
9:12
can be super important for you it can
9:14
also be helpful to know just how big
9:17
your world is going to get so with a
9:20
with your romance series is most of the
9:22
series going to be just set in this
9:23
small town then you can really focus and
9:25
concentrate on that town and the
9:27
relationships and everything else but if
9:29
you know that your heroine is going to
9:31
start out in this town but then she's
9:32
going to go to New York and then most of
9:34
the subsequent books are going to be set
9:35
in the big city then it's going to have
9:37
a very different tone to the overarching
9:40
series than just that first start of the
9:44
first book right kind of planning
9:46
forward a little bit of that can help it
9:49
can also be super helpful to know what's
9:52
going to happen next in terms of what
9:54
other characters or what other conflicts
9:56
am I going to bring into the series so
9:58
going back to the romance example you
10:01
can have your main couple in book one
10:03
you can set up the foundation in the
10:04
town and everything else but you also
10:07
want to know who's my next couple and my
10:09
next one to be planting those seeds
10:12
because when people are reading book one
10:13
the best way to get them to want to read
10:15
book two is to introduce them to at
10:17
least the hero or heroine of book two so
10:20
that they can be like oh I loved that
10:22
pharmacist she was so sweet I definitely
10:24
want to read her story right and maybe
10:26
you even want to be setting up a hero
10:29
that's troubled and is you know part of
10:32
the towns leader that's going to go
10:33
through this like big character
10:35
transformation and he's finally going to
10:37
get his Happy Ever After in book four
10:40
you might want to introduce him already
10:42
in book one as this harsh complicated
10:45
character and then you start to see a
10:47
little bit of why he's changing in book
10:49
two maybe his daughter dies and now that
10:51
starts to change him so that you get
10:53
govern that character some time and the
10:55
readers have that anticipation of I
10:57
cannot wait for his story and that can
11:00
really build things up if you're writing
11:02
let's say a Navy SEAL Team you would
11:04
want to introduce the whole team in book
11:06
one so that way you're kind of
11:08
pre-planning what's going to happen in
11:10
subsequent books right so that type of
11:13
pre-planning can be helpful but I don't
11:15
feel that you need to plan every detail
11:17
in order to be successful the second
11:18
scenario that you might find yourself in
11:20
is you might be deeper into a series so
11:24
you're not coming into nanowrimo working
11:25
on book one you're working on book four
11:27
or book five well in this situation
11:30
hopefully you have less decisions to
11:33
make and it's going to be a little bit
11:34
easier because your foundation is
11:37
already set the genre the tone all of
11:39
that has already been decided and every
11:41
everything that has happened previously
11:43
in your series is truth with a capital T
11:46
it's unchangeable now you can always
11:49
come up with creative story lines to
11:51
kind of say oh this was a lie the whole
11:53
time or whatever he's not really dead
11:55
you can always pull those things back in
11:57
but for the most part if this character
11:59
had this kind of magic or they had this
12:01
kind of struggle or this couple got
12:03
together in this previous book that
12:05
couple still has that history in a
12:08
future book so one of the first things
12:10
that I do when I'm planning a later book
12:13
in the series is I go through and I look
12:16
at two things story threads and
12:19
character arcs
12:21
story threads is where I basically will
12:24
read back through the other other books
12:25
or I'll skim back through them and I
12:28
will think about what are pieces of the
12:31
story story lines that I've been weaving
12:34
through this whole series so far that
12:37
still have unanswered questions or don't
12:40
have closure yet let me give you an
12:42
example of what I mean by a story thread
12:44
so Harper in My Shadow Demon Saga when
12:48
she first arrives in peachville she is a
12:51
foster child and we know that she had an
12:55
adoptive mother and father when she was
12:57
younger that there was an incident with
12:59
a fire and she's been moving from foster
13:00
home to foster home since then but we
13:03
don't know who her real parents are in
13:06
that first book we open a story thread
13:09
of not only who is Harper's real mother
13:12
but we find out who her mother is and
13:15
now we have a question of what really
13:17
happened to Harper's mother
13:20
in book two we learn a little bit more
13:23
about Harper's mother and then in book
13:25
three we learn even more and we start to
13:28
find out that full thread of what
13:31
happened to Harper's mother
13:33
there is also a story Thread about
13:35
Harper's father because in book two we
13:38
start to understand who he is and then
13:40
in book five we learn exactly who he is
13:42
and book six we get to know more about
13:45
the story so these are story threads
13:47
that may have just a little tiny piece
13:49
in one book and then a larger role in
13:52
the next book and then a larger role in
13:54
the next book and throughout a long
13:56
series you're usually going to have
13:58
story threads that open
14:00
questions that open and you're going to
14:02
have story threads that get tied off
14:04
with a bow that it's like okay now we
14:06
know what happened to her mother that
14:08
story thread is over and now we're
14:10
opening up a new Thread about her father
14:12
there could also be a story thread
14:15
weaving through about who one of your
14:17
characters is secretly in love with and
14:20
so you have little bits and clues or you
14:22
have little bits of moments between them
14:24
until finally five books down the road
14:27
they finally get together and confess
14:29
how much they love each other so those
14:31
are the types of things I'm talking
14:32
about with story threads they can also
14:35
be Mysteries woven throughout your
14:36
series they can also be events so let's
14:39
say you're writing a romance Series
14:41
where part of the storyline in book one
14:44
is that the heroine has returned to town
14:46
to renovate an inn that her mother used
14:50
to have that her grandmother has left to
14:52
her
14:52
so the renovation of the Inn could be a
14:56
story thread that carries through to the
14:58
second book because maybe the painter
15:00
who's coming to work on painting the
15:02
exterior is our next hero and then in
15:05
book three we have somebody coming to
15:07
town to review it for a magazine so that
15:11
thread might carry through multiple
15:14
places so one of the first things that I
15:16
do when I'm planning my book is I start
15:19
to Look Backwards so I'm not even
15:22
thinking about the book I'm currently
15:23
writing yet I just look back to however
15:26
many books I've already written in the
15:27
series and I start thinking about what
15:30
questions are left unanswered what
15:32
events are still going on what conflict
15:35
is still here between relationships but
15:38
also with the main overarching story and
15:41
I pull all those story threads onto
15:43
paper now if you know me and you've been
15:45
around for a while you know that I love
15:47
to color code things especially
15:49
different characters so you could color
15:52
code those story threads just using a
15:54
plain marker you could just make a DOT
15:56
and say okay all of the story threads
15:58
that have to do with Harper are going to
16:00
be in red and all of the story threads
16:02
that have to do with the town of
16:04
peachville itself are going to be in
16:06
blue and anything having to do with the
16:08
magic system or the shadow world is
16:11
going to be in green and you can just
16:13
start making a list of all of those
16:15
different story threads and then when
16:18
you start planning this next book in
16:19
your series you have a list of all the
16:21
things that you want to continue on or
16:24
you might want to touch on so that
16:26
people remember in this next book and
16:28
it's not a dropped story thread the
16:30
other thing I do when I'm looking back
16:32
at what's already been written is I make
16:34
a list of all my characters and I'm not
16:37
just talking about my point of view
16:38
characters which by the way this video
16:41
was originally going to be also about
16:43
multi multiple POV characters but I knew
16:45
it was going to be once I started
16:47
recording too long so we'll have a
16:49
future video about that and I will link
16:51
below some of my planning videos about
16:53
multiple POV if you were looking forward
16:55
to that today just know we're coming
16:56
back to it but if you are running
16:58
multiple POV I'm not just talking about
17:02
revisiting and making a list of those
17:04
characters I'm talking about making a
17:07
list of every single character who has
17:10
appeared in your series thus far that is
17:13
going to carry on or have some kind of
17:15
impact on this book and future books
17:19
what I would like to do again I color
17:21
code my main series characters and then
17:23
secondary characters I'll just put in
17:25
black or something like regular size pin
17:28
regular colors of pen but I will even
17:31
pull up those very minor characters if
17:34
they're going to play a role Harper's
17:36
going to go into this shop the shop
17:38
owner is there now hopefully you've done
17:40
some work to already put together a
17:42
series Bible or a Wiki or something like
17:44
that where you have a lot of these
17:46
characters already listed out but if you
17:48
don't take some time to go back through
17:50
just skim through your previous books
17:52
and make a list of those characters then
17:54
what you're going to do is you're going
17:56
to list out where did we last leave this
18:00
character
18:01
so some of this is going to relate to
18:04
your story threads and you can weave
18:06
those together and some of it will just
18:07
be like oh yeah okay so Marianne is off
18:10
with Leah and last time we saw her she
18:12
was wearing this bracelet the S6 mom
18:15
gave her and she had just cut her hair
18:18
and dyed it blonde that is not actually
18:19
what happens in my Series so don't get
18:21
shocked if you're reading it like what
18:22
did I miss but you have those kinds of
18:25
things so that you have that continuity
18:27
of remembering where you left your
18:29
characters and you pick up right where
18:31
you left off it's also helpful to
18:35
put any notes in there about what that
18:38
character has been through or what their
18:40
current emotional state is or for your
18:43
main POV character or characters what is
18:46
the character arcs that they have
18:47
already been through because this is
18:49
another pet peeve of a lot of readers is
18:52
like let's say you have this one main
18:54
heroine that is overarching for the
18:57
entire series just the one heroine
18:59
people don't want to see heroines go
19:01
through a character Arc and overcome
19:03
something only to butt right back up
19:06
against it in the next book so if your
19:08
character has already overcome a certain
19:10
trauma and she's unlocked her magic
19:13
let's say
19:14
and she's had that fight to unlock her
19:17
magic and get over the past you don't
19:19
want to open up book four and now see
19:21
that she's back to can't cast magic
19:24
again like we've been there we don't
19:26
want to have to go through that
19:27
transformation all over again we want to
19:30
build on the Transformations that have
19:31
come before so with your previous main
19:34
POV character or characters you want to
19:36
really look at what have they overcome
19:38
how have they grown so that you can meet
19:40
them in this next book where they are
19:42
currently and start building on that
19:45
because we don't want the character to
19:47
just be recycling old character arcs you
19:50
want them to have new character arcs in
19:52
each one and these are some of the main
19:54
things like I said I look at when I'm
19:56
looking at the truth of the series what
19:58
has come before and how that's going to
19:59
affect this current series another thing
20:01
I do in this planning phase for a new
20:04
book in a series though is I also think
20:05
forward so unless I'm writing the very
20:08
last book in the series which I'm
20:10
currently going to be doing and it's
20:11
hard so hard y'all
20:14
um I'm also looking forward so what
20:17
comes next what else am I going to be
20:19
setting up in this book that needs to
20:21
play into the larger character Arc or
20:24
story arc or overarching villain or
20:26
whatever so like my example with romance
20:29
what characters are coming up next do I
20:31
need to bring some new characters into
20:33
town do I need to really have some kind
20:35
of scenes here with the doctor because
20:37
he's going to be the hero of the next
20:39
book so you're thinking ahead not just
20:41
what's happening in this book but where
20:43
does it have like where does it fit into
20:45
the whole series in terms of what came
20:46
before and what's coming next and when
20:49
it comes to like a dynamic series you
20:52
want to take those story threads and you
20:54
want to think about what how am I going
20:56
to weave them through the current book
20:57
that I'm writing and not just that but
21:00
am I going to close out that story
21:01
thread in this particular book or is it
21:05
going to continue to weave forward so
21:07
let's take this story thread with
21:10
Harper's mother so in the beginning we
21:12
know that she knows nothing about her
21:13
mother but then in that first book she
21:16
does learn a little bit about her mother
21:18
and who she used to be and she even sees
21:20
a picture of her but that's not the end
21:22
of the story right in book two I weave
21:25
that thread in just a little bit but
21:27
when I'm sitting there trying to plan
21:28
book two I need to make a decision of is
21:31
this the book where we find out what
21:33
really happened to Harper's mother or is
21:35
it going to happen in the next book so
21:37
this is really a process like I talked
21:40
about like my brain ping pongs this is a
21:42
process of looking at what's passed and
21:45
looking at what's coming up and then
21:46
thinking about what's the main story arc
21:49
of this what's the main action that's
21:51
going to happen in this particular book
21:53
so you can take that list of story
21:55
threads those lists of characters and
21:57
you can start thinking what's the main
21:59
action in this story and how which of
22:02
these story threads are relevant and do
22:04
I want to close them out and answer
22:05
those questions once and for all finish
22:07
them out tie them off with a bow or are
22:10
they going to continue on and if they're
22:11
going to continue on what does that
22:13
trajectory look like and this is hard
22:16
work but it's so necessary to really
22:18
give the reader a consistent story where
22:21
you're coming back to these things that
22:23
matter so when I start to actually plan
22:25
the current book I've already done those
22:28
lists that I was talking about and
22:29
that's when I start to look at okay
22:31
what's the plot of this book and usually
22:35
the opening First Act instead of that
22:38
like into the new world and stuff like
22:40
that when you're planning a series
22:42
especially a dynamic series you're
22:45
looking at how are my characters
22:46
reacting to the end of the previous book
22:49
so for my type of series I always end on
22:51
some kind of cliffhanger or preview like
22:53
a Zinger of what's coming next and so
22:56
there's always some sort of reaction in
22:58
the next book as to what happened and
23:00
how I left them so that is part of what
23:02
comes in and that's where I start
23:03
weaving those story threads in so think
23:05
about that reaction and then start
23:07
thinking about where does this book need
23:09
to end to become a piece of that larger
23:12
picture right and hopefully that will
23:15
help you get started on your series
23:17
planning so again Go download this how
23:20
to plan your series hopefully you can
23:23
get started on your story threads and we
23:25
will talk more about multiple POV in an
23:27
upcoming video so coming up this
23:29
Thursday we're going to have what I hope
23:31
is going to be a really cool video which
23:33
is how to plan your life and how to prep
23:36
your life for nanowrimo on the
23:38
non-writing side of things like what do
23:40

23:42
on board how do you set your space up
23:44
your clothes your meal plan how do you
23:46

24:44
[Music]
hey everybody welcome back to heart breathings we are in the thick of it with preptober nanowrimo is just around
0:07
the corner so I thought it would be the perfect time to talk about planning out your characters in terms of who they are
0:14
what they've been through and what their Arc is going to be so that's what we're going to be diving into today and I
0:20
cannot wait so welcome back to Heart breathings let's get started
0:27
thank you for me one of the most satisfying and helpful things to
0:33
pre-plan before I start writing is my characters specifically my main point of
0:39
view characters but also my most important Side characters or secondary characters and my villain which I know
0:47
doesn't apply to everyone but it is important for the type of fiction that I write now before we get started down
0:53
this road I do want to also reiterate what I just said in my video from last week about planning your novel is that
1:01
everyone's process is individual and different so if you prefer to discover
1:07
your characters on the page and let them speak to you in dialogue as it flows
1:12
that is totally fine there are no right or wrong you know paths there's just
1:18
whatever path works for you is always going to be the way that is best for you so it's really a discovering your own
1:26
process that is gonna help you write faster and write better what I can do is
1:32
I can tell you some of the things that have worked for me and I can give you some of the resources so the two tools that I like to use most when I'm
1:38
planning out my characters are character profiles and character arcs and these
1:44
are two things that I could probably do an entire series of videos on but for
1:49
today we're gonna try to keep it simple a character profile is really all of those details about your character
1:55
almost like you were creating a Affidavit of them so you've got your physical appearance what type of job
2:02
they have where they live where they grew up what type of relationships they have all of those details on paper brown
2:08
eyes they're this age they're this height you could get really detailed with your character profiles and say
2:14
what's their favorite song where did they grow up what kind of friendships have they had in the past have they ever dated anybody where what would be their
2:21
favorite like you could do a full interview on your character's favorite things and stuff like that and some
2:26
people find that extremely helpful but you could also just do some Basics and try to understand your character's
2:33
personality which is a little bit more of what I'll do so we'll get into character profiles in just a second
2:38
the other one is character Arc and your character Arc is really more of the internal Journey towards transformation
2:45
that your character is going to make through this novel or through this series and the character Arc is
2:52
potentially something that you can have partially figured out before you start writing but it might also be something
2:58
that you discover again as you go through the novel so again just keep in
3:04
mind that there are no rules that it's like man I gotta have all this details figured out or my novel is going to fall
3:10
apart it's really just a matter of how much do you as an individual need or
3:16
want to have planned out before you start writing and what's going to be most helpful for you because if you want
3:22
to write a novel in 50 in 30 days 50 000 word novel in 30 days
3:28
it can be about speed and every decision that you have to make on a daily basis
3:34
in terms of how does this character talk or what uh what's their style what's their personality what have they been
3:39
through what's their backstory all of those decisions that you're making are going to make it harder for you to
3:45
actually sit down and write when you have limited time now I know not everybody in my community
3:50
is doing nanowrimo so I wanted to make sure that this video was helpful for anyone during any time of their process
3:58
but if you are trying to write quickly and you've got that deadline of 30 days maybe you want to pre-plan some of these
4:06
decisions ahead of time and just understand that it's a fluid process and it can change as you write so let's talk
4:13
about the character profile Michael Hague who is just a brilliant screenwriter and teacher says that this
4:21
character profile really comes down to four things your character's physical attributes their personality their role
4:29
and their background so I'm pulling this from his book writing screenplays that
4:35
sell and if you look in the description box and towards the end of this video I'm going to give you a whole list of
4:42
books that I have found super helpful when it comes to learning about how to create better characters because when it
4:48
comes down down to it really your characters are just such a huge part of whether or not people are going to want
4:55
to read your novel you could have the most thrilling unique exciting premise of all time the story concept is amazing
5:02
and just action on the page but if people don't relate or like or enjoy
5:08
reading your character they don't have any reason to care about your character your book is probably going to fall flat
5:13
writing great characters is such an important part of being a great novelist
5:19
and so the more that you can pour into learning the craft of writing great characters paying attention to the
5:26
characters you have loved in the past and really analyzing why did I love that character what did I love most about
5:31
them what made them resonate with me so much that is going to just elevate your
5:36
writing so much so even if your pre-planning is just picking out your five favorite Heroes that you've ever
5:43
watched in movies and going through with a notebook and analyzing what you know and what you've learned about those
5:49
characters and what can you bring out from those favorite characters to put into your own character that might be
5:56
all the pre-planning that you need but practical terms a character profile can
6:01
be just the physical appearance of your character so we're talking what color eyes what color hair what color skin
6:08
what how tall are they what how much do they weigh I what is their style what
6:14
are their physical attributes then you could also give some personality things so are they a real confident person are
6:21
they somebody who is really gentle and always kind what's their personality what do they bring to the table in terms
6:27
of how they react to other people what are their relationships then you could also figure out
6:32
what kind of job do they have or if they're a teenager what are they most interested in what are they a good
6:39
student are they a bad student are they responsible um do they have a bunch of like
6:45
responsibilities at home where they have like an absent parent but five young children that they're also taking care
6:50
of what's that sort of like Michael head calls it what's the role that they play
6:55
in their current world right now and then you also have this idea of their
7:00
background so what have they been through if we turn to some of our favorite fiction like Hunger Games of
7:07
course I love ya so I'm going to bring up a why a example that is widely known we know a lot about Katniss's history
7:13
that we understand her background as someone in this District who lost her father in this mining accident we know
7:21
that she feels like she's the one who has to bring home the food she's the one
7:26
who becomes the caretaker because of her mother and she's got this younger sister so we understand her role and we
7:33
understand her background and we see that right from the beginning and that is such a big part of why when she
7:40
volunteers to take her sister's place it's such an emotional moment even
7:45
though it's so early in the book because we care about Katniss and if you've only
7:50
ever watched the movies please go and read at least the first book because it's just such brilliant character
7:56
profiling in terms of background and role and personality right from the first chapter so highly recommend
8:03
figuring out some of those things like because really your characters are about the emotional impact that they're going
8:09
to have on the reader and so kind of pre-planning how to create a character
8:15
for this particular concept or this particular type of story that you're telling that it's going to have the
8:20
maximum emotional impact on your reader is time well spent for sure I'm going to
8:25
show you my plotting notebook so this is something that's free for you to download if you would like to join my
8:30
newsletter list so I will put the link to join my newsletter down below this is in my plot your novel workbook that I
8:37
created a couple years ago and this is what I use so this will give you an idea of what I figure out for my main
8:42
characters and this is pretty much all I do and then I'm also going to give you some ideas for how to create character
8:49
profiles that go beyond this this is a look at my plotting planner I
8:55
tend to do this in an classic sized happy planner type discs and this is my
9:02
how to plot your novel workbook you can grab this for free when you sign up for my newsletter I'll have a link for you
9:07
down below and you can just grab it for free and this has a lot of stuff for
9:12
plotting so all of this back here is plot but the first two pages of it really have to do with your character
9:19
profile and your character Arc so I'm going to talk about what's in here and then what you might want to add to it so
9:25
basically for appearance all I have is name age eye color hair color height and
9:31
then other appearance notes so if you want to put like what gender or what gender identity your character has if
9:37
you want to put what type of style so sometimes here on other appearance notes I'll put you know where's a lot of jeans
9:42
and tank tops or dresses up more often than not or often wears her hair in a long braid down one side anything that
9:50
really stands out about your character that seems unique or that seems to be kind of their like signature thing you
9:56
can put here and then most of the rest of the questions that I have here are more internal type questions that lead
10:03
me toward their background the role they play and those types of things rather than their appearance or their
10:10
personality so we'll talk about that in just a second so these questions are what is their deepest desire so for
10:17
Harper for example my main character My Shadow Demon Saga her deepest desire is really to belong to have a family of
10:24
some kind but she doesn't really admit that at the beginning of the book that is something that becomes part of her
10:30
character Arc what do they truly need even if they don't realize it yet so this kind of plays into that deepest
10:37
desire so what do they truly need so in order for her to fit in and to you know
10:43
create this family she needs to begin to love herself and to let go of this sort
10:49
of false betrayal portrayal that she has of like key pushing everyone away right she needs to be able to open up her
10:55
heart what happened in her past that hurt her or what happened in their past that hurt them or made them who they are
11:00
now this is really all about your character's wound so what has caused them to be the way they are now
11:07
if your character doesn't trust people why not if your character is closed off or they're super sarcastic why are they
11:14
like that and this can be really really important to start to figure out what is this back story right what do they now
11:22
believe to be true about themselves because of that past pain so this is something similar to what km Weiland
11:28
talks about in creating character arcs of your character your main character has a lie that they're telling
11:33
themselves so sometimes that can be that I can't trust anyone because no one is trustworthy it could also be that I have
11:40
to push everyone away because everyone who gets close to me dies so those are the types of lies that you might tell
11:46
yourself so what do they now believe to be true because of that past pain and
11:52
what are they most afraid of due to that wound or worst fears so for Harper she's most afraid that any connection that she
11:58
makes they're gonna abandon her because she's been abandoned by everyone she's ever known and so that's her worst fear
12:04
how do they portray the and portray themselves to others and what is their false self or armor they wear to protect
12:09
themselves so I feel like this is really just all kind of playing into these same questions
12:15
what do they do so is it that they become prickly that they never trust anyone that they never get close they
12:21
have a lot of one-night stands they have they have no friends they're a real loner like what is that look like in
12:28
their personality and then what is their true true self who are they deep down and this is really going to inform your
12:34
character Arc because they may not seem like this kind of person at the beginning but by the time they hit the
12:40
end of the story this is who they're really going to be so Harper might be really defeated and isolated at the
12:45
beginning but by the end who she truly is is a real leader and she hasn't had a
12:51
chance to really be a leader because she's so isolated but that's who she is deep down then in the notes section here
12:57
this is where I like to usually put something more about the character's personality so this is where I'll be
13:03
like you know they're really sarcastic or they really you know push everyone away they they lie all the
13:10
time you know whatever it might be about this particular character and that's where I'll put these notes
13:16
the next sheet that I have really has more to do with character Arc so I'll
13:21
talk about that in just a second but if you want to create a character profile that is more than just this kind of
13:28
basic things here are some other ideas you could create a Pinterest board of
13:34
your characters so this could be the types of things they like the types of jobs they have and getting real visuals
13:40
for what your characters looks like what type of clothes they wear what type of things they like to surround themselves
13:46
with what their apartment looks like all of those types of things you could also Journal about your character and just
13:52
let it free flow and see what comes up during your journaling another tool people use is to write a letter to you
14:00
the author from your character so if Harper was your main character have Harper write you a letter to tell you
14:06
what she knows about her story and you could have her write it from a place of the beginning here's how she's starting
14:13
out telling you about what happened with her mother and how she feels or you could have her writing it to you from
14:18
the end of the story of like here's how far I've come and just see what comes up about this character because that might surprise you you could also do a
14:26
character interview if you would like where you ask your character a bunch of questions and there you could probably
14:32
Google this and find a bunch of different character interview examples and see what comes up because sometimes
14:38
it's just a matter of asking yourself the question and letting your intuition and that inner part of you that knows
14:44
this character better than you think and you could also just find bit create a
14:49
list of any types of characteristics of your particular character
14:55
so I hope that gives you some ideas in the end your character profile is going to help you make those decisions ahead
15:01
of time about your character and how they fit into the world and so if you're struggling with figuring out who your
15:07
character is it might just be that you need to start writing and you'll figure them out as you go but it also might be
15:13
helpful for you to start plotting your book and start thinking about your character Arc which we're going to get
15:19
into next because your character Arc can also help you figure out what needs to
15:24
happen in the novel because you know how this character needs to change and the emotional impact you want to have on your reader and then once you know
15:31
what's happening in the story you might be able to say oh I need a character who starts out like this to make that
15:37
emotional impact at the end so it can be sometimes a ping pong like okay I'm
15:42
gonna figure out a little bit about the character then I'm going to go back to plot and then I'm going to do more character and then I'm going to do more plot and that might be the way it works
15:48
for you it definitely is the way that it works for me so I'm going to give you some ideas on that as well and just to
15:54
go ahead and mention this too it is I think helpful to start thinking about how can I make my character unique how
16:01
could they come off as somebody who's not just a cliche cardboard cutout robot going across the stage how can I make
16:08
them interesting and different and unique and a lot of this is going to come from that personality and the role
16:15
that they've played and the background that they've had so far what they've been through what wounds they have what
16:20
uh struggles they've overcome or could come from the fact that they've never had to struggle before and this plot
16:28
that you're throwing into them is the very first time they've ever had to find their own strength so think about that
16:34
in terms of your character and that can set you down the right path now your character Arc has more to do with the
16:40
internal shift or transformation now this is where it gets difficult to fit
16:45
it all into one video because there are many different types of character arcs
16:50
so you have a positive character Arc where your character grows in some way and positive way but you also do have
16:57
negative character arcs where your character grows towards the dark side so to speak and another popular thing that
17:04
you see in a lot of like police detective mystery thriller type things where you have an even urban fantasy
17:10
sometimes where you have kind of the main character that goes across multiple books for a long period of time is you
17:16
have a more flat character Arc where your character doesn't really grow and change in any substantial way from one
17:23
book to the next and it's more plot driven than it is character Arc driven so you see that with a lot of police
17:29
procedurals or detective stories or sometimes urban fantasy and other things like that so it's helpful to know what
17:36
type of character Arc you're writing if you want to study more about this I highly recommend k.myland's book
17:43
creating character arcs this one is more advanced I would say in terms of really understanding how it all fits together
17:50
it's it's brilliant but it's a little bit overwhelming I felt at first read
17:55
but if you want to read some really great book if you want to read a really great
18:00
book that has great examples of different types of character arcs if you want to figure out what kind yours is definitely pick that up again Linked In
18:07
the description for you I am 100 of the time dealing so far in my writing with
18:13
positive character arcs and I think most of us are and so that's usually where I
18:19
am and the book and resource that made the biggest difference for me in figuring out how to create a piece of my
18:28
character Arc and plan it before I start writing was James Scott Bell's book write your novel from the middle now he
18:34
has since expanded on this concept of writing your novel from the middle in a in a beat he calls the mirror moment
18:41
into a book now called superstructure where he talks about the entire plot of the novel so you could pick up either
18:47
one of these books and get some information but if you really want to hone in on this mirror moment definitely
18:53
pick up uh write your novel from the middle again tons of resources for you linked in the description box but he
18:59
basically talks about how when he was analyzing films he noticed that along
19:05
with this midpoint this changes everything plot point there often was an internal beat in the character Arc in
19:13
movies from different genres from The Hunger Games again to Lethal Weapon to
19:19
um I think he mentions Casablanca and they're just totally different genres there's this emotional beat in the
19:26
middle that he calls the mirror moment which is a moment where your character is acting as if they're looking in a
19:31
mirror right not physically but metaphorically looking in a mirror and
19:36
saying what have I become they're seeing the truth of themselves so this is what
19:41
km Weiland calls the lie your character tells themselves and it's this moment where your character's
19:48
coming face to face with who have I become and this realization that if I
19:53
don't change I'm going to die and that death can be a literal death in some
19:59
cases or depending on the type of genre you're writing it could be a metaphorical death like I will never see
20:06
my dreams come true I will never fall in love I will never be the person I was meant to be if I don't change and it's
20:12
that mirror moment that propels them toward that transformation that you're gonna see at the end so it's kind of a
20:19
triangle so let me show you a little bit more about how I use this concept when I'm planning my novel
20:25
okay so now we're back in this planner and this is where we really start to
20:31
think about character arcs so in a minute I am going to talk about goal
20:36
motivation and conflict so this is here in this sheet and this comes from Deborah Dixon's uh book goal motivation
20:43
conflict that I'll have linked for you down below and then this character Arc section here where are they in the
20:48
beginning of the story where are they in the mirror moment or middle of the story and how do they end up this is what I'm
20:54
talking about with James Scott Bell so I'm going to just kind of pull to this empty sheet here and I'm going to show
21:01
you what I like to do when I'm trying to figure out my character's Arc so I will often create this triangle so this comes
21:08
from his book Write Your Story from The Middle and this point here is the beginning
21:15
where your character is in terms of their Arc and their internal progression at the beginning of the story this is
21:21
the middle of the story and this is the end of the story and so a lot of times if you think about where what is this
21:28
mirror moment what is this change or die moment or you think about what do I need my character to have changed into what
21:36
type of character do they need to be by the end of this story then you can really start to flesh this out and all
21:42
you need is these three points and this is often where I start with all of my character arcs so let's say you're
21:48
writing a romance novel with a main heroine who doesn't trust anyone let's
21:53
say she was hurt in her past her father abandoned her and she just has major trust issues so here in the where does
22:00
your story begin you might put trust issues and you might have filled out this early part of this workbook with
22:07
why she has these trust issues what happened with her father why she feels she can never ever trust anyone and how
22:14
does she act because of that maybe she has decided that she has trust issues because she also feels like she isn't
22:21
worthy of love right so she doesn't trust anyone she feels unworthy
22:26
and she pushes everyone away so if you know that's how she starts out
22:31
the story that pretty easily can inform how you know she needs to end the story
22:37
because in order for her to become someone who's the heroine of a romance novel she's gonna have to get over all
22:43
this stuff in order to fall in love with the right guy right so we can sit here
22:48
and we can say okay by the end of this story she needs to be someone who trusts again
22:55
and who sees her own worth who understands that she's worthy of
23:01
love and instead of pushing everyone away she's in love right yay so hopefully you
23:09
guys can see that let me kind of zoom in a little bit
23:15
so we've got trust issued and she's unworthy she pushes everyone Away by the end of the novel she needs to have
23:21
transformed and changed because in order for her to be capable of falling in love she has to be learn to trust she has to
23:27
learn to see her own worth and she has to be able to fall in love and open up her heart so this mirror moment or this
23:34
Middle Point here needs to be what James Scott Bell calls a change or die moment
23:40
so a lot of times this will be a moment for our heroine where she sees
23:48
a glimpse of what life could be like if she became this person
23:54
maybe it's a rare moment where the hero makes her laugh or maybe it's a moment
23:59
where they're intimate together and she starts to understand that like maybe this guy's different and if you learn
24:05
and you've watched enough story you know that this kind of moment where she sees a glimpse of her happiness is going to
24:11
send her into a spiral most likely where she pushes him away again and that leads
24:16
us to the black moment which then becomes the Catalyst for her massive transformation
24:22
so just to use a different example my current novel The Disappearance of
24:29
Vanessa Shaw I have many characters so I've got seven
24:34
potentially eight point of view characters but the main character of this story for me is Lorelei she's just
24:39
the main person so Lorelei is where I'm gonna start and at the beginning of this
24:45
book she is she's in deep depression she feels like she's got a lot of guilt over
24:53
what happened she's seeking closure sorry for my really bad handwriting here
24:59
she's seeking closure she's depressed and in fact she doesn't know that she has a real reason to continue on with
25:06
her life then by the end of the story in order for it to be a positive character Arc
25:11
she needs to have started down some kind of healing Journey so she's going to have closure she's going to understand
25:18
that it's not her fault what happened or is it done done
25:24
and she's going to you know let go of that guilt she's going to find a path to
25:30
moving forward so that is going to mean that this midpoint moment this middle mirror moment for her is going to be a
25:37
moment where she realizes that she does have a future ahead of her that she does
25:44
want to live because if she has no real reason to live here
25:50
and she's feeling guilty this change or die moment for her here is going to be a
25:55
it can be change or die or what James Scott bill says it can also be what have I become
26:00
and for her this is going to be a moment of understanding that she has really
26:07
since Vanessa disappeared she has really let her life go off the rails and so it's going to be a moment of like oh my
26:14
gosh if I continue down this path I'm gonna die basically I really will die and so she's got this glimpse of like
26:21
maybe I do have what it takes to solve this mystery and move on with my life
26:27
and so now she's going to move toward closure but not before she passes through the true death Stakes here in
26:33
the middle but this for me is where I start with my character Arc and I will forever be grateful to James Scott Bell
26:40
for introducing me to this concept because for me this really unlocks so much of what's going on with my
26:46
character because if I can see who they are at the beginning and how they need to transform by the end and then I can
26:52
usually figure out so what is it that this mirror moment has to say change or die or what have I become and so
27:01
how does that play into their character Arc then once I figure out just those three points I can really start to flesh
27:07
out what is her journey from this to this what types of moments or experiences does she need to have along
27:14
the way to come to this realization that she has a future she needs to have some kind of connection with someone she
27:19
needs to start solving the mystery she needs to understand that there were some Secrets Vanessa was keeping that made
27:25
her not understand the full picture so there's going to be a lot of those things when we move back up to our
27:30
romance heroine up here we can look and say okay so she's got these trust issues she pushes everyone away in order for
27:37
her to get to this point where she sees a glimpse of what life could be like if she started to trust again we have to
27:43
take her on a journey to that so there's going to be scenes here that lead her to that moment and so this is how your
27:49
character art can really help you plot your novel and really figure out how it's going to go then you also need for
27:55
this moment this mirror moment to start to lead them down a path toward the dark
28:00
moment where she's going to basically break up and feel like there's you know
28:06
all hope is lost and then eventually of course the grand gesture where the
28:13
transformation occurs so I think character Arc can really help you to understand even just this one two three
28:20
part of character art can really help you understand how to write your novel so it's really pretty cool okay so I
28:27
know this is a lot I hope this has been super helpful for you there's so much more that I could say about this the
28:33
other thing there's there's two more things I want to say one being that the other thing that can be super helpful in
28:39
coming up with your character Arc is to also go through their goal motivation and conflict so of course this also
28:46
comes from Deborah Dixon but is talked about in many different books including Michael hagg's um writing screenplays that sell and
28:53
story genius a lot of people talk about this so it's this idea that your your main protagonist is going to have a
29:01
outer goal external goal so this is the thing they want to get the person they want to defeat the Revenge you know
29:07
whatever they've got that external goal that drives the plot but then you have an internal goal as well so for example
29:13
this could be my character Harper at the beginning of beautiful demons she is alone she's isolated she thinks nobody
29:20
loves her she doesn't fit in anywhere and so her internal trajectory or her
29:26
internal goal is one that may not be aware like you're it's what your character needs but it might not be
29:32
something they're aware of until the middle of the novel in that midpoint moment so for Harper her real goal is
29:40
she wants to belong she wants to have a family and that really becomes tied into
29:47
the theme of the entire series which is this we're stronger as a family the more
29:53
that we can build together this positive connection and positive relationships the more we can defeat anything that
29:59
comes at us and so so this first book starts with her feeling completely alone and Abandoned and so part of her
30:07
character Arc and her internal goal is to create a family of her own or to find
30:13
people that she fits in with but that's not what the book is about the book is about a murder mystery right but we're
30:19
talking about that sort of invisible internal character Arc that your character is going through so definitely
30:25
think about that too so not just the external goal but what's my character's internal goal meaning what do they need
30:31
what do they need in order to change when you're talking about a romance a lot of times too you're talking about
30:37
two characters playing off of each other sometimes more than two but we'll stick with two so you've got you know the the
30:44
hero and heroine or depending on what genders you're dealing with you've got the romantic couple here and they for
30:52
some reason are not able to be together until they transform and that's really at the heart of what romances are all
30:58
about is that these two people who are meant to be together need to release themselves from the pain of their past
31:05
and they have to learn to love each other and that usually takes some kind
31:11
of transformation and that's where the emotional impact comes from so depending on what genre you're writing really if
31:17
you can identify what is that internal Journey that my character needs to take how did they need to transform then
31:23
that's where you get the real emotional impact in your novel so if you want to read more about that check out goal
31:29
motivation and conflict from Deborah Dixon and all of the resources that I have for you down below second thing
31:34
that I wanted to bring up before we go is how much of this do you have to do for those secondary characters so the
31:40
profile stuff I do a lot of that for my secondary care characters but when it comes to character Arc I don't usually
31:46
feel that it's necessary to have a full character Arc for secondary characters
31:51
so I don't think you need to go through this idea of internal goal for each of
31:57
your side characters that never actually come on stage as a point of view character so maybe take a moment as you
32:03
begin writing to think about which of my characters need an arc so if you're writing a romance both of those
32:10
characters need to have a character need to have an arc right they both need to have some kind of transformation to come
32:16
together if you're writing a single protagonist like beats the bad guy then
32:22
maybe you just need that single protagonist to have their own character Arc and interestingly I just started
32:27
reading the heroine's journey by Gail character and I think it's brilliant so might be another one that goes on the
32:34
resource list to really start thinking about the difference between the hero's journey and the heroine's journey and
32:39
it's kind of blowing my mind so I'm enjoying that right now too so so I know that this was a lot of information and I
32:47
know that there's so much more that we could dive into when it comes to character arcs but the main things that
32:52
I want you to remember is a character profile means deciding ahead of time some of those things about your
32:58
character's physical appearance their job their personality who surrounds them and what they've been through in their
33:04
past then your character Arc is really about how does all that stuff you figured out in their profile and all the
33:11
things maybe you figured out when it comes to plotting your novel play into how your character changes over the
33:18
course of this book do they need to become stronger do they need to learn to trust and another thing to keep in mind
33:25
is that that character Arc is often going to be very closely tied to the
33:30
theme of the novel so if you have a novel whose theme is coming home again
33:36
then you might have a character who has a an arc of
33:41
really learning to trust themselves and to allow themselves to be happy you know
33:47
to not think about the bright lights big city but instead to understand that happiness comes from within so that
33:54
might be part of the character Arc if you have a theme in your book that is
34:00
man versus machine then you might have a character Arc there where your character
34:05
is learning to find his inner strength so that he can be strong enough to fight against a machine that doesn't have a
34:11
soul right so it could be some of those things but they're often tied so very closely together so that might be
34:17
something that Sparks something for you as well when you start thinking about what's your theme so we're going to go a
34:23
little bit more into this when it comes to series planning and multiple POV in Sunday's video I'm also going to have a
34:29
bonus video for you guys tomorrow that's totally unrelated to preptober where I'm gonna share some fun Erin Condren
34:35
goodies for the holidays and my new Erin Condren Hello Kitty planner so that'll just be a fun kind of Friday video for
34:41

34:47
because it does help tell YouTube that other people might like it too and go ahead and leave a comment down below and
34:53
