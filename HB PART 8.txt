
hey guys welcome back to heart breathing's I am so excited to bring to you today a video I've been talking about for a while as well as something a
0:07
lot of you have requested and wanted to know more about which is why I write and love Google Docs instead of another
0:13
program like say Scrivener or a word so let's get into it [Music]
0:21
so there are really three main reasons why I'm in love with Google Docs and I
0:26
wouldn't write in anything else and then there are a couple of little like cherry on top kind of items so let me just go
0:32
through those and then what I'm gonna do is I'm going to show you an example of actually like take you through my screen
0:38
and show you an example of Google Docs and why I love it so much if you haven't really played around in it very much I
0:43
think you'd really enjoy it so I'm really just gonna kind of give you a walk through but first let's talk about
0:48
why I love Google Docs as much as I do first of all the number one absolute
0:53
number one thing is that because Google Docs is a cloud-based internet based
0:59
program it saves automatically as I type so I can literally type three letters
1:05
and it's going to be saving those three letters so if my computer gives out or
Saving
1:10
the internet blinks off or you know some some kind of storm hits and my computer gets hit by lightning whatever it is
1:17
saved automatically to the cloud so it's not just saved locally on my computer I'm not just worrying about like have I
1:24
saved recently or am I going to lose several paragraphs it is saving pretty much constantly and this is the number
1:30
one reason why I love Google Docs now I'm not necessarily doing I guess a comparison between Google Docs and
1:36
Scrivener but let's just say I know that Scrivener if you haven't heard of it it's one of the more popular and it's
1:43
very robust program that is wonderful for writing novels there's a lot you can do in Scrivener that you cannot do in
1:49
Google Docs so I'm not at all saying like you know Google Docs is better for everyone if you love Scrivener and you
1:55
love the like outlining and the ability to bring in images and you know put your
2:02
cork board and different things like that into Scrivener and you can move your chapters around and there's all
2:07
kinds of features in Scrivener a lot I didn't even get to use because they're just so many it's a very robust pro
2:13
but the deal-breaker for me with Scribner as much as I loved it as a program for writers is that I lost
2:19
things and if I didn't remember to save every single time or you know wouldn't
2:26
know exactly which version because every single time I would finish writing in Scribner I would have to save it and
2:32
because I was using multiple devices I would have to zip up the program put it
2:38
up into the cloud like into Google Docs or into Dropbox and then I would have to
2:43
go home locate the most recent file and then open it unpack it and it was just kind
2:49
of a hassle now it's been years since I used Scrivener so maybe they've made the process easier and if they have and you
2:55
know they have comment down below and let me know that but back in the day you had to zip it up when you were done find
3:01
the file when you get home in the cloud download it unzip it Brent you know import it into the Scrivener on your
3:08
desktop or whatever and it was just really difficult because I had a Mac laptop and a pc desktop so I was
3:15
constantly like feeling like I'm missing little pieces I could never find the right version it was just kind of a
3:22
hassle for me so one of the things that I love about Google Docs is I never couldn't lose anything unless Google's
3:29
entire servers go down which I think at that point we're at the apocalypse anyway
3:35
you pretty much are going to keep every single thing and you can edit and save
3:40
your Google Docs even when you don't have an internet connection you just have to set it up inside Google Docs to
3:46
allow you to save offline so I write on a Chromebook which you can't download
3:52
something like Scrivener to a Chromebook it's just purely web-based programs and I love it because the second I open it
4:00
up it's on I don't have to wait for it to like boot up or anything like that it's super fast the battery life lasts
4:06
all day so I never worried like when we go out riding with friends on Wednesday I go right with my NaNoWriMo Crew every
4:11
Wednesday I don't have to worry about finding outlet like so many of them do because my computer just will last for
4:17
days and days without me having to plug it in or find an outlet and of course the Chromebook goes so well with the
4:23
Google Docs but if I don't have an internet connection which I often don't when I'm at Barnes & Noble because
4:28
if you've ever tried to write the Barnes & Noble cafe if there's a lot of people there sometimes you don't get a great internet connection but anyway I don't
4:35
have to worry about that because I have it set up where I can still continue to write in Google Docs and it will just
4:40
save it there on my hard drive of the Chromebook and then as soon as I connect up online when I get home it just saves
4:48
all that to the cloud so it's pretty much a seamless process even if you don't have internet access so constantly
4:54
saving especially saving to the Google cloud because I'm on the internet probably 99% of the time is a lifesaver
5:01
I don't have to worry about losing my work and as writers if you are somebody who has ever lost some of your work you
5:08
know how heartbreaking it can be I have lost work when I had a word
5:13
processing file like just from word that got corrupted and I lost like 10,000
5:18
words and it was just devastating that kind of stuff just doesn't happen in Google Docs and even if you get worried
5:24
about it you can always just click file and make a copy and now you've got an extra copy just in case something were
5:29
to happen to it so just the fact that you're never gonna lose anything is number one reason why I
5:35
love Google Docs the number two reason also goes back to that same thing that I was having that frustration with
5:40
Scrivener where I had two different types of devices and would have to constantly be you know shifting from one
5:46
to the other Google Docs is seamless when it comes to using your other devices so if I want to you know I'm
Seamless
5:53
sitting there while my son's at his dentist appointment and I'm like oh I've got a really good idea and I want to
5:59
write and work on that then I can just open up my phone open the Google Docs app and I've got my document right there
6:05
and I can be writing in it right here I can be speaking into it with the text to
6:11
our speech to text part of the app or I can just be typing things in or swiping
6:16
them on my keyboard if I'm on my laptop I can do the same and I can literally pull it up seconds later I don't have to
6:23
like zip anything or put it in the cloud or save it to the cloud or email it to myself which I know a lot of people
6:28
email their documents to themselves to save it I can just literally type a few words here put my phone down open my
6:35
laptop and it's already so it's just the seamless process of it saves not only to the cloud but it also
6:41
seamlessly works from one device to the other so I can be riding all day at Barnes & Noble cafe have gotten you know
6:48
a couple thousand words I can get home start dinner and then I can just walk over to my PC sit down pull up that
6:54
document and it's exactly where I left off at the cafe and I can start writing a few sentences here and there then
7:00
after dinner I can sit down on the couch and type up a few things or edits what I wrote earlier in the day on my phone
7:06
I've got a tablet also that's in my bedroom sometimes that I will like play around with Pinterest and stuff in the
7:12
evenings I could pull up my document and be reading from there so the fact that it works seamlessly over all your
7:17
devices is like a number one absolutely amazing part of using Google Docs ok and
Collaboration
7:23
the third reason this is the other like these are my three big reasons why I love Google Docs the third reason is the
7:31
collaboration and this is something that I don't think you can do on Scrivener and you can't really do as well on word
7:37
so this is what is like boom the number one like one of the number one reasons that I use Google Docs and love it so
7:44
much because as a writer who is self-published I like to you know make
7:50
the process as seamless as possible when it comes to my beta readers and my editors because I don't want to be
7:56
spending weeks like sending files over waiting for things to come back you know and so on so this is part of why I know
8:02
a lot of you were like how do you get your books edited and out and published so quickly and this is part of why
8:07
Google Docs is a savior when it comes to this so I will show you when I show you
8:12
the kind of screen share and we're gonna walk through but one of the reasons is because it's so collaborative so since
8:18
it's all available online when I finish my document all I have to do is share it with my beta readers and with my husband
8:26
who is kind of my alpha reader he's the first person who reads my documents usually my novels and I can share it
8:32
with them and I can say okay I'm ready for you guys to take a look at it and they can go ahead and be commenting even
8:38
if I'm editing chapters down the road so we can all be collaborating on the same document at the same time so let's say
8:45
I've got a 5 chapter I'm going to show you short story that have that has fourth
8:51
chapter so let's say I've finished editing chapter 1 and now I'm moving on to the final read-through of chapter 2 I
8:57
can go ahead and share that document with my beta readers and say I'm ready for you guys to get started and while
9:03
they're reading through I'm reading through an editing chapter too so that saves me so much time because I don't
9:08
have to get all the way to the end of the novel or all the way to the end of the short story before they can start on
9:13
it alright so they can go ahead and be adding comments and then as soon as I'm done with my edit or my final
9:19
read-through I can go back to the top and see where their comments have been and I can start going ahead and making
9:24
changes which makes the collaborative process extremely quick I don't have to wait for my beta readers to finish the
9:32
entire novel before I can go ahead and be making changes on edits and this saves me weeks literally weeks worth of
9:38
my time and I love it then the other big thing with the collaboration is that I
9:43
don't have to marry a bunch of documents so if I have say three beta readers that
9:48
I'm using on a regular basis if they get three different you know they get the same document but they're getting three
9:54
different documents so when they start editing it you know the beta reader number ones comments are going on to
10:02
document number one beta reader number two is going on a separate document and three is going on a third document so
10:08
then when they're finished and they email me they're emailing me three different documents so I would have to go through beta readers number ones
10:15
comments anything that I'm going to change I would need to change it in my main document same thing with two and
10:22
three so then I've got to do three complete read-throughs of all of their changes and everything's all in separate
10:27
places and hope that I've remembered to make all those changes and all those edits in my main like base file with
10:36
Google Docs I don't have to do this because all three beta readers are commenting on the same online file this
10:43
just blows my mind in terms of how much like this has changed my process it has
Saves Time
10:48
saved me so much time so much aggravation it is so amazing to just have my base document my final edited
10:56
document have all three beta readers and my husband all commenting on the same document so that also saves them time
11:02
because if beta reader number one gets to a typo and they see that beta reader number two has gotten there before them
11:08
they don't have to mark it again there's also a chance for them to have a dialogue and so what means what I mean
11:14
by that is sometimes beta reader number one will say I don't know I don't think
11:19
that Harper would be acting like this she's acting kind of like a spoiled child and I just think she's crying too
11:25
much or you know whatever I don't think she would be doing like this it doesn't seem true to her character well beta
11:31
reader number two can come through and see that comment and say whether they agree with it or not so they can say you
11:37
know what I get what you're saying here maybe she's crying a little bit too much but I don't think she's acting like a spoiled child because this whole thing
11:43
has just happened to her so maybe what you need to do is just really beef up like this emphasis on this event that
11:50
happened and then this reaction will seem more valid I mean I don't know I'm just making things up but then beta
11:55
reader number three could come in and say I totally agree with number two and that you know this is how it should be
12:00
but I agree that she is not overreacting then I kind of have an idea of how they all feel about it and it gives them a
12:06
chance to sort of see what other people have said and whether they agree and when you have a group of beta readers
12:13
that are really good at working with each other and kind of helping each other then it just enhances the entire
12:19
process and enhances that the novel and the characterization so much but the
12:24
main thing there is this the time that it saves me I don't have to wait until I'm finished with the entire novel if
12:30
I've got like the first act is edited I can go ahead and move the first act to a final document and I can go ahead and
12:38
have my beta readers working on that and so they're working on act 1 while I'm
12:43
finishing up the final edits of act 2 and by the time they get done with it they can send me a text that says hey
12:48
I'm done with act 1 when is that two gonna be ready and I say hey I'm ready for you now and then while they're doing
12:53
act 2 I'm finishing up the final pieces of act 3 and then as soon as I'm finished with that part I can go all the
13:00
way back to act 1 and be working on their comments and implementing their changes while they're reading act 2 so
13:07
hopefully that makes a lot of sense in terms of how fast that can make the process I also am super
13:12
I know that I have beta readers that at this point are willing to usually just kind of drop everything and read through
13:19
stuff like in a couple of days which is amazing but it just saves me so much time in the process because I don't have
13:26
to wait for them to finish they don't have to wait for me to finish we can be sort of collaborating on the document at the same time and it's been a lifesaver
13:32
so what we're gonna do now that I've kind of given you my top three reasons why I love love love Google Docs is I'm
13:38
gonna actually take you to my screen and I'm gonna show you what it looks like once you're inside the docs this story
Inside Google Docs
13:45
Locksley is not a novel this is just a short story that I wrote for a recent anthology that came out last week called
13:51
once upon a star which is a fairy tale retelling anthology and it has a sci-fi
13:57
twist so this is kind of like a virtual reality story that I wrote and really enjoyed and I wanted to kind of show you
14:03
just an example of what it looks like when you're inside Google Docs so this is my story Locksley if I click up here
14:10
I can actually rename it so I could name it you know Locksley Once Upon a star sorry my keyboard is
14:18
super clicky and then I can also change to where it's saved inside my drive so I
14:23
could change it in and put it inside you know a different folder if I wanted to have just a folder of short stories or
14:30
my different pin names you know you can always organize Google Docs in that way and then this is the main document so as
14:38
you can see over here on the left side if you use titles and so see here where
14:44
you click through style if you use titles or headings then it will auto create this sort of outline on the side
14:50
which I really like that this was a feature that wasn't available in Google Docs a few years ago but it is now so I
14:56
like that because I can go to chapter 2 chapter 3 chapter 4 and so on without having to you know just scroll down like
15:04
you do in Word and I think word now has outlines too but it's nice that they add it into Google Docs all right so if I
15:10
wanted to go to the bottom and I wanted to so I just liked it a command-return
15:17
that creates a page break here and then I could create you know chapter 5 and
15:23
give it a name and then what I would do is I would actually go ahead and return there so that I can save my little like presets
15:31
up here then I can highlight chapter 5 go to normal text and give it a tough
15:39
you know title or I've been calling these headings so as soon as I give that a heading you see it pops up over here as another piece of this outline so I
15:46
usually will call my chapters headings if I have a POV like carassius POV then
15:52
I will often highlight that and I will give it I'll call it heading 2 and if you see how this works then that will
15:58
put her like just a little bit tab 2 over so if I had a POV for each one of
16:05
these let me just do that here just to
16:11
show you an example because I write a lot of multi POV and I know a lot of you write like romance where you have two POVs and so on so I could have a chapter
16:18
title and then if I put that as heading or I could do title and subtitle if I
16:24
wanted and it would do the same thing so I would call the chapter title heading 1 or title and then I would call the POV
16:30
either heading 2 or subtitle and then that way when you're doing your outline it will show you which POV so that way
16:38
when I'm kind of looking through and I want to pick out like all of parish's chapters or all of harpers chapters or
16:44
whatever then I can easily see what chapters belong to her and which ones don't so just just a little I guess bonus
16:51
feature there if you were interested in seeing kind of the capability of how it taps out the outline another thing I
16:57
wanted to show you is that here's part of that collaboration that I was talking
Collaboration with beta readers
17:02
about now I do actually this is already a document that's been published the short stories
17:08
already been published so I have already resolved all of my beta readers comments and I actually don't want to just like
17:14
show their names and and like out them as my beta readers so I won't show you
17:19
that but what I had was I just grabbed a my husband and asked him to make a couple comments so that you guys could see an example of how the comments look
17:25
when they're you know inside the document so this is what I'm talking
17:31
about the collaboration so when I was finished with you know like I'm ready
17:36
for other people to look all I have to do go to share and then I can put in people's email addresses and I can even
17:42
send them a little message so I could say share I won't click it because it'll show you the email addresses of my beta readers but I would say share I would
17:49
put in their email addresses and then I would say hey guys the first part of Act one is ready for you guys to go over
17:55
text me when you're finished reading and I'll let you know when Act two is ready to go so I can leave them little
18:01
messages and then what they can do is when they come into Google Docs all they have to do is highlight something and go
18:09
to this little plus sign over here where they can add a comment and it will put their name up here so I know who's
18:15
making the comment and they can say you know should this be italic and yes it
18:20
should but you know I'm just saying like they could leave a comment like that and even me as an author can go in and leave
18:27
a note to them so I could if I wasn't sure about this I would say how do you guys feel about this opening sentence
18:35
does it bribe you and I can leave that
18:42
here for them so that when they open that document and they're you know first opening it they could come in and they
18:47
could actually comment on my comment so see how when I click on it it says reply
18:53
so beta reader number one could come in the mail like it beta reader two could come in and respond and say this is the
18:59
hex fix it I want something more interesting and now we've got a
19:07
collaboration going so I could see at that point where their comments are and
19:12
their replies to each comment so that's one of the really cool things then when it's my turn to come back through it I
Resolving comments
19:18
can just click on it and I can say okay I'm gonna fix this a little bit and then I'm gonna resolve it and when I resolve
19:24
it it goes up here now if I clicked on this where it says comment history then it would show you all of my beta readers
19:30
comments so if you accidentally resolve something or you want to go back and see it later it does save it in your comment
19:36
history but like I said I'm not going to open that because I don't want to show their names but so if they said should
19:43
this be italics you know somebody could reply to that by clicking on it and reply and say no I don't think it should
19:48
Sarah what do you think you know whatever and when I'm ready and I've fixed it in the document I can click resolve so I just
19:54
had my husband kind of go in and give an example so we can see it says George Pitman and they'll say oh should we come up with a more interesting name for the
20:01
Iron Guard at that point another beta reader could come in and say I really like the Iron Guard I think it is
20:06
interesting or somebody else could say yeah I agree this is kind of a boring or like predictable name let's come up with
20:13
something cooler and then I would know that I could work on it so that's the great part about the collaboration that
20:19
you can do between your beta readers and when I'm done with it I either decided to keep it Iron Guard or not I can resolve it and if I want to
20:26
bring it back up I can always pull up the comment history and show it there so as I go through the
20:32
document I can easily see where people have commented and so then I get down to
20:38
the bottom of the chapter and my husband has made another comment here so you can
20:43
comment down below if you know what this link star is from where I use the word connect when he's connecting to the
20:49
virtual world there's another show that we absolutely love and anime that we love where they say links start instead
20:55
of connect so that's where his look cute little comment came from from there so if you know it comment down below and
21:02
let me know because it's one of my favorite animes of all time so I could resolve that and now that comet is gone
21:08
but it lets me know what I've worked through and what I haven't so like let's say I had to stop at the end of chapter
21:15
2 because oh my gosh I was just so tired so when I close the document and I come
21:21
back tomorrow I can know that I'm starting on chapter 3 and I can start there and see if there's any other you
21:28
know comments that have gone here so you can see here here's one that he made on February 1st when he was going through
21:33
it and I marked it as resolved and then I reopened it so that you could see an example of you know how the comments
21:40
looked but it's pretty cool the way that you can collaborate inside Google Docs
21:45
and I just absolutely loved it and of course just like any typical like word processor you can change you know up
21:53
here you've got bold italics underline and they're short keep codes like for each one of those you can add links you
21:59
can change the color you can change the font I usually stay in Ariel you can change the size of
22:05
the font pretty much anything anything that you can do in any other type of word type
22:11
processor you can do inside Google Docs you can also like if I highlighted a
22:17
certain section here I can go to tools and word count and I can see here like
22:24
that I've just highlighted two hundred and eighty five out of eighty 658 words
22:30
and characters and so on I know that one of the more popular add-ons here is
22:36
called track my words I haven't actually used it myself but it's probably one of the only like word count kind of add-ons
22:42
and I think it brings up something on the side so you can set targets and stuff like that but I haven't personally used it if you know of any other add-ons
22:49
that work really well with Google Docs for writers let me know I haven't really looked into it very much because just
22:54
the base program works really well for me and so I just haven't really used it you can also do if you see here you can
23:01
do voice typing which allows you to do text I mean speech to text so you can
23:08
kind of use it sort of like Dragon Dictation or something like that so if you want to use dictation I have not
23:14
found it to be as beefy or as robust as Dragon Dictation it does a pretty good
23:20
job but it's not amazing but I don't tend to do much dictation so I don't really use it too much anyway but it is
23:28
there just in case you were interested in knowing and of course you've got you know up here you've got the spider bar
23:33
that you can use to create your you know instead of tabbing or whatever this is
Auto indent
23:40
your like Auto indent I usually set mine at point 1 9 here and that looks nice
23:45
and it's you know stays one of my only complaints like something you kind of have to learn is that if you like say
23:51
you're here and you're in a subtitle or subheading if I click return on that it
23:57
sends this all the way back to the beginning and I have to restart my where I want my auto tab so typically the way
24:04
that I will get around that is when I'm first creating the chapter see how it
24:13
will keep it when I first do the page break it'll keep it here so I like to tap down a couple and then
24:19
just go up arrow to get here so I got chapter five parish and then all I have
24:25
to do is click down here and it's kept it for me just like a tiny little thing I don't even know if that made sense to
24:31
you guys but anyway it keeps it from me having to reset that auto tab every
24:38
single time I start a new chapter just you kind of learn the hacks as you go
24:43
what makes things faster but for the most part I have to tell you I super love Google Docs I think that it's an
24:50
amazing way to write your documents as a writer because you can see up here I
24:55
just type a little bit of things and it's already saving it and every change you make is automatically saved in Drive
25:01
so it's it's saving it as I go and I just think that is absolutely amazing
25:06
and I don't have to worry about anything getting lost or misplaced because it's
25:11
always here inside if I click on this Doc's home over here it's gonna take you to all my documents which is all my
25:18
heart breathing stuff and just everything I have like personal addresses and you know different things
25:24
like that but you can see I also have some of my novels like shallow and I
25:29
have pandemic which is an old novel I've been working on fate surrender which is right here and there's a search function
25:36
so if I wanted to look for thanks surrender I can search for it and of
25:41
course it's going to show me everything that is related to faith surrender so
25:47
I've got the document here I've got old old titles or old chapters of pandemic which is what has become faith surrender
25:55
so there's a search function that you can always find and I think that you can even search for like characters names
26:01
and it's gonna pull things out of the text so it's like Harper is my main character so now it's pulling up any
26:06
document that minjun's Harper which is all of these books of my shadow demon
26:12
saga so the you know the search I think could actually be a little better than it is but it's really not so bad and
26:18
it's nice to actually have that search and you can see like when was the last time I opened this document and you get
26:24
kind of some of that data but those are basically the number one things that I love about Google Docs and
26:30
the reason I love to use it pretty simple things but it makes life so much easier and so much less stressful to not
26:37
have to worry about losing things to be able to access it from anywhere on any device and to be able to collaborate
26:43
with other people which saves me so much time I hope that that gives you guys a really good idea of why Google Docs is
Conclusion
26:50
such an amazing program for writers and like I said I know that it's nothing compared to like all of the beefy things
26:57
that you can do with Scrivener Scrivener is incredible and I really love to using it but I found that I wasn't using a lot
27:03
of the things like when it comes to the corkboard with the different index cards I like doing that stuff on paper I'm
27:09
just kind of if you haven't guessed from my channel before I'm kind of a paper person so I like doing stuff on paper so
27:16
I want to have those physical index cards so it wasn't really using that now what I did use is some of the color
27:21
coding that you can do with the POVs and stuff and I missed that and I'm hoping that maybe eventually Google Docs will
27:27
get a little bit more robust or people will do add-ons for Google Docs that will make it a little bit more Scrivener
27:32
like but for now the pros far outweigh the cons and even though there's a lot
27:38
of really cool stuff inside Scrivener for me just the peace of mind the collaboration and all of that that
27:44
goes into working in Google Docs is kind of a lifesaver for me and it sort of
27:49
cancels out the desire for me to use Scrivener if you love Scribner you might
27:54
could do both that you could use Scrivener for your main writing and then import that document into Google Docs for your beta
28:01
readers so that you can still use the collaborative things even if you're not using it to write normally so that's an
28:07
idea for you as well you could kind of use both things if you're in love with Scrivener which I don't blame you because it is an amazing program and one
28:16
of the other things that is kind of a downside I guess is that compared to like a program like word Google Docs
28:23
does not seem to have a super beefy grammar checker so sometimes it will tell me words are misspelled that I know
28:30
are not misspelled sometimes it will it you know it doesn't catch a lot of the more grammar things like double words
28:36
and missing words and sentences or like commas and stuff like that now if you guys know of an add-on for Google Docs
28:42
that is better grammar checker please let me know I know that grammerly is something that you can use inside your
28:48
browser but I didn't particularly like grammar early so I'm not really up for using that one but if there was an
28:54
add-on for Google Docs I might be interested in trying that but what I do now because I love word in terms of
29:01
their grammar checker sometimes they're wrong because it's still a computer checking your grammar but it's that kind
29:07
of like a final read-through thing for me so usually my process is once my beta readers are done with the document I've
29:14
implemented all the changes and they've caught all the typos they can catch and everything else I will take my Google Doc and I'll go to file and then I will
29:20
export it as a word doc and then I will upload that into just my word program by
29:27
Microsoft Word program and then I will run the grammar check on it and a lot of times that will catch any further like
29:32
typos that Google Docs didn't check and that my beta readers didn't catch and it will catch like compass and commas or
29:40
you know different things like that and like I said you have to be careful with words grammar checker because sometimes
29:45
it will recommend things that actually actually aren't correct because it's just like their computer is picking up
29:50
things but it's not really the right way to do it or it'll be like an incomplete sentence and it's trying to I don't know
29:56
it just doesn't get it a hundred percent right so you can't just like accept everything you need to read through and
30:01
make sure that it's really correct but I find that to be another way to clean up
30:06
my document at the very end before I send it to my editor and then I let her you know fix it the final time but she
30:14
always comments about how cleaning my documents are and I know that it's twofold it's well it's threefold because
30:21
I actually am kind of a grammar nut myself so I'm I write very clean when it comes to my writing anyway but also the
30:28
collaboration with my beta readers where they're kind of checking each other inside the same document is one really
30:34
great thing and then the second thing is using that word final check to just go through spell check grammar check
30:41
because it's a lot beefier than the Google Docs grammar check which I don't even think there is a grammar check inside Google Docs so that's like one of
30:48
the downsides to it but if you also have Microsoft Word anyway then you can do like me and kind of double use the
30:54
process there and of course everybody should be using an editor anyway so you've got that final look but it is
31:00
helpful when you want to turn in a clean document to an editor because the less
31:06
errors you turn into them the more errors the more percentage of errors they're going to catch so other than
31:11
that I can't really think of many drawbacks to using Google Docs I mean if maybe you don't like the interface or
31:18
something like that or you just really love all the extra things that you get with scribner then you know you won't
31:24
get that with Google Docs but other than that I mean to me there's no better program because you're always going to
31:30
have everything saved you're gonna be a hundred percent like safe when it comes to that you've got the collaboration and
31:36
you can access it and work on it from any device at anytime like even if I left everything of mine home and I was
31:45
visiting a friend as long as I know my Google login I can log in as a guest to
31:50
her computer or her phone login and I have access to my document whereas if I
31:55
was trying to carry around a USB key or trying to you know save things on to a
32:01
you know in to my email or something like that it just wouldn't be as accessible because maybe that person
32:06
doesn't have Scrivener on their computer or whatever but everybody has access to Google Docs since it is just an online
32:13
web-based program so to me it is absolute like number one best thing that you can use to write and this is why I

33:35
[Music]
your novel so welcome to the second
0:19
video if you haven't yet watched my plot
0:22
overview I will stick a card up here
0:24
somewhere so that you can go back and
0:26
watch that if you would like there's
0:27
also a free principle over on my website
0:30
at heart breathing's calm slash plot
0:33
your novel you can get free downloads
0:34
for all these guides that I am talking
0:36
about in this series so the first video
0:38
we talked about just an overview of
0:40
story structure but today we're going to
0:43
start diving into characters so you may
0:50
be wondering why is she including a
0:52
whole section on characters when we're
0:54
supposed to be talking about plot well
0:56
it doesn't matter if your story is
0:58
character driven or plot driven you
1:01
cannot have a great novel without great
1:04
well-developed characters and it can add
1:07
so much to your plot if you take some
1:10
time in the beginning to really think
1:12
about who your characters are what their
1:14
journey is because you can't just take
1:17
any character and plop them into a story
1:21
that story is going to be affected by
1:23
what that character is going through who
1:25
they are and if you can find that great
1:28
synergy between the characters story arc
1:30
and the plot of the story that's when
1:33
you really get something special so it's
1:35
worth it I believe to take the time out
1:38
to really think about your character and
1:39
how your character story arc relates to
1:42
the plot in general now sometimes for me
1:45
this doesn't fully solidify itself until
1:48
after I'm halfway through the novel or
1:50
even sometimes when I'm all the way
1:51
through to the end of the novel
1:53
sometimes I'll be like oh that's why
1:55
this thing wasn't coming together or
1:57
that's why she wasn't wanting to do this
1:59
sometimes I've got character where I'm
2:01
like okay this is how she's going to be
2:02
and then somewhere during the plot I'm
2:05
like nope she's not gonna do that cuz
2:06
that's just not who she is and I have to
2:08
recalibrate but I do find that planning
2:10
in the beginning does help me at least
2:13
have a starting point and kind of a
2:15
basic idea of where this character is
2:17
going and how they would react in these
2:20
story situations all right so the things
2:22
that I have found to be most helpful for
2:25
me as far as resources are km Rylan's
2:29
character arc book and I will link that
2:32
down below for you as well as a series
2:35
of articles that I have read online and
2:37
workshops that I've been to from Michael
2:40
hang but I have read I've been to one of
2:42
his workshops before and I have read
2:44
several articles that other people have
2:46
written about his workshops he does also
2:48
have some books on writing screenplays
2:50
and story structure in most bookstores
2:55
and in the library so I will link some
2:57
of those down below even though I
2:57
haven't read them I've just read the
2:59
articles that he has about character art
3:01
and finally one of my favorite of all
3:03
time resources for working through
3:06
character arcs stuff is Debra Dixon's
3:08
book goal motivation and conflict and I
3:10
will also link that for you down below
3:11
most of the information that I'm going
3:14
to talk about through this plot series
3:15
is a combination of things that I have
3:17
gotten from reading a lot of really
3:20
great books on these topics as well as
3:22
just my own personal experience from
3:24
writing these novels so I will be
3:26
putting some of this stuff into my own
3:27
words but if you want to dive deeper
3:29
please check out those resources from
3:31
these other great authors who have put a
3:32
lot of time into teaching others how to
3:35
do this okay so I did mention to you
3:38
that I have a guide that I've put
3:40
together for this entire plotting series
3:42
and you will find in that guide a
3:43
section on the characters inner journey
3:46
now this is just something that I print
3:48
out and I fill out for every POV
3:51
character in my story and by point of
3:53
view character I mean a character that
3:55
were actually in their head and we're
3:56
seeing their thoughts and their actions
3:58
are what is helping to shape the story
4:00
in a lot of my y-a I started out with
4:02
just first-person single point of view
4:05
but then I gradually branched out to
4:08
writing multiple points of view so my
4:10
main series like my shadow demon saga
4:12
started off with just one main character
4:14
and then as of book 7 it now has four
4:17
main POV characters so in the beginning
4:20
I just started out with one character
4:23
now that I have four main POV characters
4:25
I will print out and fill out this
4:27
character's inner journey sheet for each
4:29
one of those main multiple point-of-view
4:32
characters and it is super valuable for
4:34
me to be able to do that for every
4:35
single character that I am writing
4:37
doesn't mean all the side characters are
4:39
the best friends or anything else but a
4:40
character who actually becomes a point
4:42
of view character this is very important
4:44
so basically what I'm gonna do is I'm
4:45
gonna take you through the characters
4:47
inner journey based on what I what I
4:50
usually fill out and we'll just kind of
4:52
talk about some of the details of it as
4:53
we go one of the main things to keep in
4:55
mind is that your characters provide the
4:58
emotional depth to your story their
5:00
story arc influences the plot and who
5:03
they are influences what actions they
5:05
will take and how they react to things
5:07
throughout the story so coming up with
5:10
and really diving into who your
5:12
character is how they would react what
5:14
kinds of things they based in their past
5:16
and what kinds of feelings and
5:19
challenges that they have is going to
5:21
greatly impact your plot and what
5:24
happens throughout the plot so as we go
5:26
through this characters inner journey
5:27
just keep that in mind that everything
5:29
we do here is going to influence your
5:31
plot itself because certain characters
5:34
are going to act and react certain ways
5:37
to different plot points and different
5:38
antagonists first thing I do is just
5:41
fill out what my character's name is
5:42
their age I color hair color height and
5:45
any other kind of appearance things that
5:48
I might want to note so for example I'm
5:50
gonna go all the way back to my
5:52
character of Harper from beautiful
5:54
demons which is the first book in my
5:56
shadow demon saga I wrote this book all
5:58
the way back in 2010 so even though I'll
6:01
be taking you through some spoilers
6:02
hopefully anyone who wants to read it
6:05
can either go grab it right now for free
6:06
I will link that book down below
6:08
beautiful demons or you can just deal
6:10
with there being some spoilers here okay
6:12
so she's 15 she has brown eyes and
6:15
blonde hair and she's about five foot
6:19
five she's fifteen when the story opens
6:21
any other appearance things are she
6:24
often will wear a ribbon around her
6:25
wrist and she explains why in the story
6:27
and it does actually become important
6:29
plot point that ribbon does thematically
6:32
later in the series but she often wears
6:35
jeans or
6:36
she'll wear clothes that kind of look
6:38
more Punk or a lot of black stuff like
6:40
that now what I do after just the basics
6:43
of the description which is good to have
6:45
for reference is getting more into who
6:49
the character is so I ask a series of
6:52
questions about my characters and then
6:54
fill them in as best I can at the
6:55
beginning of the story and like I said
6:57
some of this might change as time goes
6:59
on but this is where I am at the
7:02
beginning of getting to know this
7:03
character so what is their deepest
7:05
desire like this is something they know
7:09
that they want what is it her deepest
7:11
desire so for Harper it's to be loved to
7:14
fit in she wants nothing more than to
7:17
feel like she's a part of something to
7:19
feel like she is accepted and loved for
7:22
who she is that is her deepest desire
7:24
now she may not admit it to anyone else
7:26
but she knows deep down this is her
7:28
deepest desire then I ask what does she
7:30
truly need even if she doesn't realize
7:33
it yet so this may be something that she
7:36
doesn't even know she needs instead of
7:38
something that she wants this is her
7:40
true need like what does she need to
7:43
truly be happy and for Harper it's to
7:46
truly love and accept herself she knows
7:48
or thinks that she wants to be loved by
7:50
others but what she doesn't realize that
7:52
she needs is to truly love and accept
7:56
herself what happened in her past that
7:58
hurt her or made her who she is now so
8:01
for Harper you know sometimes you'll
8:03
hear this called a character's wound or
8:07
their ghost
8:08
this is something that happened in their
8:09
backstory that profoundly shaped who
8:12
they are and what they believe about
8:14
themselves so this is usually some sort
8:16
of really deep-seated event or fear or
8:20
you know just something that happened
8:21
and you don't have to explain this right
8:24
away in the backstory but it's just
8:25
something good that you should know
8:27
about your character because it is gonna
8:28
shape who they are and what they believe
8:30
about themselves so for Harper she was
8:32
orphaned by her parents so she's grown
8:34
up in foster care and there was a fire
8:37
when she was 8 years old where her
8:39
adoptive father died and that fire was
8:43
her fault and so that night that night
8:46
shaped her life forever
8:47
because she internalized the fact
8:50
that it was her fault that it was her
8:52
strange abilities that caused this to
8:54
happen and so knowing that that wound
8:58
that she carries with her not only of
8:59
being abandoned once by her parents
9:02
whoever they were but also that you know
9:05
once she finally found a family that was
9:07
willing to adopt her she was the
9:10
catalyst behind one of those people
9:12
dying and being abandoned again and
9:15
going into the foster system
9:17
so it's this feelings of abandonment in
9:21
her past that shaped who she is now and
9:23
obviously shaped her deepest desire and
9:25
her deepest need so then what does she
9:28
now believe to be true about herself
9:30
because of this past pain so it's kind
9:32
of like asking yourself what did that
9:34
thing that happened in my character's
9:36
past how did that affect them and how
9:38
did that change who they are and how
9:41
does it change who they believe
9:42
themselves to be so for Harper fact that
9:45
she finally got what she thought she
9:47
wanted which was a loving family that
9:48
adopted her and then she ruined it she
9:52
now believes that she is a broken person
9:54
that she is not worthy of love she wants
9:58
it desperately but she feels like
9:59
everybody who gets close to her is gonna
10:01
get hurt in some way or that she's just
10:04
going to continue to get Bandhan so she
10:06
feels that she is unworthy of love she
10:08
truly believes that she is a damaged
10:11
person sometimes you will hear this
10:13
called the lie your character tells
10:15
themselves but it can also just be the
10:17
belief that they have and it is usually
10:18
not true but this is how they believe or
10:21
see themselves so for like Harper she's
10:24
broken she's trouble she's dangerous to
10:26
be around and she's unworthy of love and
10:28
that all stems from this fire where she
10:31
accidentally killed someone she loved
10:33
what are they most afraid of due to that
10:35
wound and what are their worst fears
10:38
so usually their worst fears come out of
10:41
whatever it is that happened in their
10:43
backstory whatever that wound is it
10:45
affects their fears because they're
10:47
usually your character is afraid of that
10:51
same thing happening all over again
10:53
so for Harper her worst fears is that
10:55
she's gonna lose control of her powers
10:57
again and hurt someone else which is
10:59
going to leave her being alone and
11:02
and yet again those are her greatest
11:04
fears how did they portray themselves to
11:06
others what is their false self or the
11:08
armor they wear to protect themselves
11:10
so because Harper is afraid of being
11:13
abandoned and afraid of hurting other
11:16
people she comes off really sarcastic
11:18
and like she doesn't care she comes off
11:20
like she's a loner like somebody who is
11:22
perfectly fine on their own thank you
11:24
very much
11:25
that is kind of the armor she wears
11:27
around her self because she truly
11:29
believes that if she allows anyone into
11:31
her life they're either gonna get hurt
11:32
or they're gonna hurt her
11:33
and so that is in direct conflict with
11:36
her deep desire to be loved she pushes
11:39
people away before they can push her
11:41
away what is their true self who are
11:42
they deep down truthfully Michael hey I
11:45
think calls this their essence deep down
11:48
truly Harper is a deeply feeling person
11:51
who she has such a great capacity for
11:53
love that she would be willing to give
11:57
up everything and sacrifice everything
11:59
for the people she loves
12:00
but she's never really been able to
12:02
express that part of herself because
12:04
she's never let down these walls or
12:06
truly believed she was worthy of love
12:08
but that's who she is deep down is
12:10
someone who is fiercely loyal and
12:12
fiercely loving so once I go through and
12:15
I have all of those things figured out I
12:18
have a much better picture or clearer
12:21
picture of who my character is in this
12:23
moment now I'll talk a little bit more
12:26
at the end about how you deal with this
12:27
when you're writing a series character
12:29
that will be you know featured
12:31
throughout many books because you don't
12:33
want them to fix everything that's wrong
12:34
with them and be perfectly happy forever
12:36
after at the end of book 1 so you have
12:38
to kind of paste their character arc but
12:41
we'll talk about that a little bit more
12:42
at the end so once I have this first
12:44
part of the inner journey figured out
12:45
then I go and I fill out on page 2 the
12:49
outer and inner goal motivation and
12:52
conflict remember I mentioned this book
12:54
by Deborah Dixon it's amazing and I've
12:55
pulled this table directly from her book
12:58
so please go and get that book if you
13:01
want to really understand how to fill
13:03
this out for yourself but basically all
13:05
the work that we just did figuring out
13:07
your character's deepest fear they're
13:09
wound what they really want but what
13:10
they need all of that is going to play
13:12
into the inner goal of motivation
13:15
clicked on this sheet let's go ahead and
13:17
look at that so I've got the outer gold
13:19
a division conflict in the first table
13:21
there the first column and then the
13:23
inner is in the second column so let's
13:25
go ahead and fill out the inner column
13:27
here Harper's goal this is when we're
13:30
talking about the inner conflict or
13:32
inner goal motivation of conflict we're
13:35
often talking about what does she need
13:36
what not what does she think she needs
13:38
but what she her true inner goal or her
13:41
inner need is to believe in herself and
13:43
be accepted for who she is
13:45
motivation is why does she need that
13:47
well she needs it because she will never
13:48
fit in and find her heart's desire of
13:51
being loved if she's trying to be
13:53
someone else and if she doesn't truly
13:55
love herself the conflict there is that
13:58
she doubts herself she gets in trouble
14:00
when she tries to be truly herself and
14:03
she's afraid of being abandoned
14:05
and because of that fear she doesn't
14:09
allow herself to see who she truly is or
14:12
what you know that she's truly worthy of
14:14
love so that helps it to easily fill out
14:17
that inner goal motivation and conflict
14:19
now going over to the outer goal
14:21
motivation conflict this is directly
14:23
related to your plot so this is more of
14:25
the outer things that she needs
14:27
so her outer goal when she starts this
14:31
story is to fit in at peach Ville high
14:34
school and be on her best behavior the
14:36
motivation or her why behind that is to
14:39
avoid the juvenile detention center at
14:41
the very beginning of the story her
14:43
social worker has told her this since
14:46
she's been kicked out of yet another
14:47
foster home for messing ups her her
14:50
powers actually are what are getting her
14:52
in trouble when she gets angry she you
14:54
know things fly around the room and she
14:56
gets in trouble for like attacking
14:57
people even though it wasn't something
14:59
she did on purpose but her social worker
15:01
has told her that this shadow fir'd home
15:05
for troubled girls in peach Ville is her
15:07
last chance absolutely her last chance
15:09
and if she messes things up here she's
15:11
going into juvenile detention center
15:13
until she graduates so if she truly
15:16
wants to fit in and find you know place
15:18
where she can be accepted this is pretty
15:20
dire circumstances he or she has to be
15:24
on her best behavior and not get into
15:25
any trouble so the motivation there is
15:27
to avoid juvenile
15:29
Detention Center because this is her
15:30
last chance and the conflict often will
15:33
be multiple tiers of conflict so the
15:36
first conflict for her is that she can't
15:37
control her powers or her ability she
15:39
doesn't have the skills or the tools to
15:41
control them and in order to be on her
15:44
best behavior she needs to learn to
15:45
control them so those are at conflict
15:47
with each other and then the biggest
15:48
conflict of the story is that a
15:51
cheerleader at this high school is
15:53
murdered and there's evidence that
15:55
points to Harper being the murderer so
15:58
there goes her best behavior because now
16:00
people believe that she has actually
16:02
killed someone which is pretty much the
16:04
worst thing she could have possibly done
16:05
and of course plays again on her
16:07
greatest fears after what happened to
16:10
her adoptive father basically all you
16:12
need to do is figure out what is your
16:14
character's goal why do they want that
16:16
goal and what is keeping them from
16:18
achieving it on both a plot standpoint
16:21
and an inner standpoint if you filled
16:24
out the characters inner journey at the
16:25
beginning then filling out the inner
16:27
goal motivation conflict is going to be
16:29
super easy the outer goal motivation and
16:32
conflict you may not hundred percent
16:34
know all of that right away but you
16:36
might work through a little bit more of
16:37
that as we get into the plotting but if
16:40
you can just sketch out a basic what
16:42
does your character want to achieve like
16:43
what is their goal or their quest and
16:45
why do they want it and what's keeping
16:48
them from it you'll be so much better
16:50
off when we go to start plotting the
16:51
story then just as this final character
16:55
arc section here I like to always mark
16:57
where my character is at the beginning
16:59
of the story the middle of the story and
17:01
the end of the story this is you know
17:04
not really doing something so different
17:06
from what I've done but it's just sort
17:08
of clarifying it so that I know and can
17:10
very easily see where my character is
17:12
going from the beginning to the end
17:14
sometimes I will also fill this out as a
17:16
as a triangle with the mid middle at the
17:19
top so I've got the beginning the middle
17:21
and the end over here so at the
17:23
beginning of my story Harper is scared
17:25
of being abandoned so this is like all
17:28
of this prolonging her need all that
17:30
plays into this what her fears are she's
17:32
scared of being abandoned or being sent
17:34
to juvenile detention she's trying to
17:36
hide who she really is
17:38
and she doesn't truly love and accept
17:40
herself by the middle of the story or
17:42
the mirror moment if you really want a
17:44
good explanation of the mirror moment
17:46
you can pick up James Scott Bell's
17:47
superstructure but she also wrote a book
17:50
called I believe it's called write your
17:52
story from the middle and it is all
17:54
about the midpoint or the mirror moment
17:56
so I will link that down below as well
17:57
he covers some of what he says in that
17:59
book in superstructure but he just goes
18:02
a little bit deeper into it in this
18:03
other book but she for harper it's this
18:06
moment of who-who am i really like
18:08
realizing for the first time that there
18:10
are others who have powers like her and
18:13
understanding that there's more to the
18:15
story more to her own story than she
18:18
believed so it's the first time that
18:20
she's starting to really see that there
18:23
is more to her story than she ever knew
18:26
before which is kind of the one of the
18:29
first steps into her accepting herself
18:31
for who she is because she never really
18:33
understood who she was in the first
18:34
place then the end of the story she has
18:37
finally found someone else to accept her
18:39
for who she is and she finally feels
18:42
that she is starting to fit in somewhere
18:44
so one thing that you will see about
18:46
this particular thing this is where I'm
18:48
gonna get into a little bit about your
18:51
characters arc when they're when you're
18:53
writing a series so my character if
18:55
Harper started out when she was 15 she's
18:58
now 20 years old when she when I'm
19:00
writing the books now so this is she's
19:02
we've been through years of her life
19:04
with her she's grown up throughout the
19:06
story so she's very different now that
19:07
I'm working on book 10 than she was all
19:09
the way back in book 1 and I did not
19:12
want her to be a static character now
19:15
sometimes an episodic like mysteries
19:17
where you have a detective or the same
19:19
character that recurs it's really so
19:22
plot driven that you're not seeing a lot
19:24
of changes in that character as it goes
19:26
but with my type of story and with a lot
19:28
of stories you're gonna have substantial
19:30
character growth and one of the things
19:32
that readers don't want to see is a
19:34
character growing to a certain point and
19:36
then when you get to the next book
19:38
they're right back to being the same
19:40
person they were before so for that
19:42
reason you need to make sure that you're
19:44
you know taking that character down
19:47
specific steps along their journey to
19:49
who they
19:50
will someday become so for example with
19:53
Harper she doesn't really get to a point
19:55
where she fully loves and accepts
19:56
herself in at the end of book 1 she
19:59
makes a tiny step on that journey
20:01
because she begins to understand a
20:04
little bit more of her own backstory in
20:06
her own past and she's finally been
20:09
accepted by another group but you start
20:12
to see in book 2 how she really still
20:14
isn't being true to herself and is still
20:16
trying to pretend to be someone else or
20:18
something that she's not so she hasn't
20:20
fully evolved yet but she's made a small
20:22
step into who she will eventually become
20:25
so when you're writing those characters
20:27
in a long series you need to think about
20:29
how many books you're going to be
20:31
writing and where you want the character
20:32
to end up at the end of this epic saga
20:35
or if it's just three books or two books
20:37
how long does your character have to
20:40
make that true character arc and how can
20:43
you allow them to grow a little bit in
20:45
each story so that they're slowly
20:47
getting to be who they are
20:48
now she may reach a point where she
20:51
truly believes and accepts herself you
20:53
know by book five or six but then she's
20:55
got new inner journey that she begins in
20:58
book seven and that is in fact what
20:59
happens with Harper but characters
21:01
wouldn't want to see her you know coming
21:03
against this wound of feeling that she
21:06
can't control her powers and that she's
21:07
a broken person and then she evolves
21:10
past it and she's feeling like she
21:11
believes in herself and then in the next
21:13
book she's suddenly a broken person who
21:16
doesn't believe in herself anymore that
21:18
would just be really difficult to read
21:20
as a reader you want to see this
21:21
character evolve and then grow and grow
21:23
and grow and they're always going to
21:25
have things that they have that are
21:26
challenges to them but it's just
21:28
important to make sure that when you're
21:30
writing a series that you do allow that
21:32
character to grow and then stay in that
21:35
state of growth as they're facing yet
21:37
another challenge okay
21:40
I think that is enough about character
21:41
arc be sure to check out the resources
21:43
that I mentioned down below also be sure
21:46

hey guys welcome back to heart
0:01
breathing's we are towards the end of an
0:04
eight part series on the top tips and
0:07
advice that I have for you after eight
0:09
years of self publishing as an indie
0:12
author and if you are new to the series
0:14
or new to my channel my name is author
0:16
Sara cannon I write mostly young adult
0:19
contemporary fantasy fiction and I have
0:22
been self-publishing since october of
0:24
2010 in that time span i have published
0:27
about 25 books a little over 25 books
0:30
and i have sold nearly 3/4 of a million
0:33
copies of my ebooks so what I decided to
0:36
do to celebrate those eight years in
0:38
indie publishing is to give you guys
0:40
some of my top tips and lessons learned
0:42
over the course of this you know pretty
0:45
short career but eight years feels like
0:48
quite the milestone for indie since I
0:49
got in kind of at the beginning but I
0:52
hope that guys have been enjoying this
0:53
if you are new to it like I said I will
0:55
link for you the other six videos down
0:58
below but we today are on video number
1:00
seven of eight and we are gonna talk
1:02
about why you should never stop learning
1:09
so even Stephen King in one of his
Keep Learning
1:12
recent short story collections whatever
1:14
his most recent one was he had this
1:16
little snippet toward the beginning
1:18
where he was talking about his writing
1:19
and he was like you know even though
1:21
I've gotten you know all these awards
1:23
I've had this amazing career I still
1:26
feel like I'm just a newbie at this
1:27
whole writing thing and you know I'm
1:29
paraphrasing him there but that really
1:31
struck a chord with me because I thought
1:33
you know I definitely feel the same way
1:35
I go back and I look at my first book
1:37
beautiful demons and I think gosh I've
1:39
learned so much and I I guarantee you
1:41
eight years from now I'm gonna look back
1:43
on this book that I just released last
1:44
week and go wow I've learned so much
1:46
because there's always another level to
1:49
unlock with our craft there's always so
1:52
much more to learn and it is super
1:53
important if you want to have a long
1:55
career that not only feels emotionally
1:58
satisfying to you but that is fun and
2:01
that you continue to challenge yourself
2:02
and continue to get better then you need
2:05
to keep learning and of course I am sort
2:08
of one of those like natural learners
2:10
like for example I had friends literally
2:13
mailing me and calling me when the Harry
2:15
Potter books came out because they were
2:17
like oh my gosh there's this character
2:18
called Hermione and she is you with our
2:20
hand always raised and always got to
2:22
know all the information and yes that
2:24
was me growing up and still to this day
2:26
I am a natural learner I would be in
2:29
school you know I kind of self-inflict
2:31
school upon myself at all times I am
2:33
taking business courses all the time I'm
2:36
learning you know constantly reading
2:38
books on crafts reading books on mindset
2:40
and trying to better myself
2:41
but even if you are not someone who
2:44
really enjoys learning I think that one
2:47
of my top tips for you is to always keep
2:49
trying to get better and trying to grow
2:52
in this career and of course I am
2:54
talking about the craft things so I'm
2:56
talking about you know if you're writing
2:58
mystery continue to get better at like
3:00
upping that tension and revealing those
3:02
twists and writing better detectives or
3:05
better mysteries that really you know
3:07
people don't see coming or whatever it
3:08
is that you're writing that applies or
3:10
if you're writing romance like how can
3:12
you continue to get better about really
3:14
like pulling putting your heart into
3:17
that characters arc or if you're writing
3:19
romantic comedy like how can you get
3:20
even better at making people laugh and
3:23
surprising them with your comedy
3:24
whatever that is for you with what your
3:27
writing should always be working to get
3:29
better at you know how to plot your
3:31
novels how to pace your novels how to
3:33
write better dialogue how to write
3:35
better characters there's always more to
3:36
learn and sometimes we learn just of
3:38
course by writing the books but also you
3:41
know reading new books like I doesn't
3:43
matter that I've been at this really a
3:45
lot longer than eight years but you know
3:48
I've read lots and lots of books on
3:50
craft but I'm always still looking for
3:52
more I'm always looking for that next
3:53
plotting book that's gonna unlock a new
3:55
level for me or another book on writing
3:57
great characters or strengthening
3:59
character arc or writing better dialogue
4:01
and those things are always there I'm
4:02
still going to workshops at places like
4:04
rwa and I got to learn from the Michael
4:07
Haig this year at the rwa why a day of
4:11
why a at the rwa conference this year
Balance
4:13
and it's like they're still just there
4:15
are so many masters still to learn from
4:17
and it doesn't matter if you've written
4:19
two books or 200 you can always get
4:22
better so on the craft side keep
4:24
learning but with that being said
4:26
keep learning on the business side too
4:28
because there is a balance here to being
4:31
a self-published author you have to be
4:33
good at the craft you have to be writing
4:34
good books and getting better and better
4:36
but you also need to be learning the
4:39
business as you go learn the nuances of
4:41
the genre that you're writing like what
4:44
makes character what makes reader's fall
4:46
in love with that genre what are the
4:48
tropes what kind of covers work best for
4:51
this and the answer to that question
4:53
might be different in 2016 than it will
4:56
be in 2020 but continuing to learn
4:58
learning better strategies learning
5:01
better tactics learning better pricing
5:03
techniques or better ways to communicate
5:06
with your fans there's always so so much
5:08
to learn and we are so very lucky in
5:11
this digital age that we have things
5:13
like YouTube and you to me and skill
5:15
share and you know courses and Facebook
5:18
groups and masterminds and all of these
5:20
resources at our fingertips that people
5:22
never had before and we have the world
5:25
at our fingertips so there's never been
5:26
an easier time to continue learning and
5:30
of course I was just talking about in a
5:32
previous tip that you can't do it all
5:34
and you really can't but I would love
5:36
for you to prioritize somewhere in your
5:39
schedule every 90 days continuing to
5:42
grow and to learn more so always like I
5:45
almost always have you know things up on
5:47
my 90 day board that are related to
5:50
learning so right now I'm in a course
5:51
called the blog tube is hive where I'm
5:53
learning more about you know how to be a
5:56
better blogger and how to get better SEO
5:58
and get more people on Pinterest if I'm
6:00
focusing on the business side of that
6:02
but I also on the yellow tab those are
6:05
my personal goals I have some books that
6:08
I'm reading for personal development as
6:10
well as I'm reading The Wheel of Time
6:11
series I'm on book 4 by Robert Jordan
6:14
and that is something that I'm learning
6:16
from because he is just a master at
6:19
description and multiple POV and
6:21
planning out this really long series so
6:24
I'm learning from him just by reading so
6:26
you know read continue to learn in all
6:30
these different ways but as a side tip I
6:33
just want to add this to be careful who
6:35
you're learning from and make sure that
6:38
you're you know the credential
6:40
of the person you're learning from so
6:41
for example don't sign up for a course
6:44
from someone telling you that they're
6:46
gonna teach you how to successfully self
6:48
publish your books if you look at them
6:51
and you find out that they've only sold
6:53
a hundred copies of their own book I do
6:55
know that sometimes the best teachers
6:58
are not necessarily you know the biggest
7:00
authors or the you know the best of the
7:02
best but if someone is going to be
Best Teachers
7:04
teaching you how to do something they
7:06
should have some sort of track record of
7:08
doing it themselves and proving to you
7:11
that they know what they're talking
7:13
about and unfortunately the more popular
7:16
indie publishing becomes the more sort
7:19
of I guess you could call them scammers
7:21
come out of the woodwork because they
7:23
see an opportunity because as authors
7:26
we're all wanting so desperately to
7:29
learn how to make a living and so if
7:31
they come up with this really great
7:33
spiel about how they're gonna teach you
7:35
to make twenty thousand dollars a month
7:37
all you have to do is pay you know two
7:39
thousand dollars and they're gonna show
7:41
you all these secrets it can be very
7:43
tempting to want to sign up for that
7:45
course especially if you've been
7:46
publishing for a while and you're not
7:47
getting where you want to go and of
7:50
course there are some amazing teachers
7:53
out there that can really teach you how
7:55
to run better advertising and how to
7:58
have better strategies and how to upload
8:00
your books and how to you know all of
8:02
the things that you need to learn but my
8:04
warning to you is just check out that
8:06
person and make sure that who they are
8:09
and what they're doing and what they say
8:11
aligns with what you want to learn and
8:13
who you want to learn from so if it
8:16
turns out that this person who's
8:17
charging two thousand dollars for the
8:19
self publishing course ends up that
8:22
they've never really self-published
8:24
their own books or they can't prove to
8:26
you how they got where they got or it
8:29
turns out that that course is really all
8:30
about like teaching you how to buy
8:32
someone's ghostwritten books and then
8:34
how to market those using Facebook Ads
8:36
maybe that's not exactly the kind of
8:38
person you want to learn from because
8:40
what you want to do is write your own
8:42
books I think that it can be easy
8:44
sometimes to just want to take advice
8:46
from anyone out there who seems to know
8:48
or seems to be having a little bit of
8:50
success but one of the reasons I'm
8:52
giving you this Warren
8:53
is that there are a lot of people out
8:55
there who want to give you advice and
8:58
there they don't really have your best
9:00
interests at heart and one of the main
9:02
reasons that I wanted so badly to start
9:05
this channel to start heart breathing's
9:07
and start getting some of this
9:09
information out there that I have
9:10
learned is because I just started to see
9:12
a lot of people pop up with really bad
9:15
advice and bad information like I was in
9:18
a forum of authors once we're not that
9:21
long ago where somebody said hey guys
9:24
what was the best advice you've ever
9:26
gotten in your career and sadly there
9:28
were many authors in that thread that
9:30
said something along the lines of the
9:32
best advice I ever got for my indie
9:34
career was that I had to stop treating
9:36
it as an art and stop thinking I could
9:39
write the books that I wanted to write
9:41
and I had to start treating it like a
9:42
business and then if I wanted to be
9:44
professional I was gonna have to make
9:45
the really tough choices and forget
9:47
about trying to be you know an artist at
9:50
this and just stick to the business and
9:53
you know that advice broke my heart
9:56
because the truth is you know yes there
9:58
are some jaded people out there that
10:00
just have had to you know they feel like
10:01
they've had to turn away from the books
10:03
they want to write because they couldn't
10:05
make money doing it but the truth is it
10:08
is not an either/or scenario there is no
10:11
truth to people saying you cannot write
10:15
what you want to write you have to see
10:17
this as a business and you have to
10:18
abandon all hope of this being an art
10:21
there is a way to write books that you
10:24
truly enjoy and truly love writing and
10:27
that you can pour your heart into and
10:29
make money doing it and I am proof of
10:31
that and I have many friends that are
10:33
proof of that now
10:34
you can't ignore the business side of it
10:37
it would be very difficult for you to
10:39
just popcorn like 12 different genres
10:41
and you know never coming up with any
10:43
kind of strategy we've talked about this
10:45
before in my series on how to write a
10:47
best-selling series strategy is
10:49
important book covers are important the
10:51
business side of this is very important
10:53
but if you end up with someone giving
10:56
you advice and they're telling you that
10:59
you cannot be you know a creative person
11:02
and put your art into this and write the
11:04
books you love and make money those are
11:06
not the kind of
11:07
people you want to be listening to if
11:09
you truly care about your art and I was
11:13
feeling very very passionate about
11:16
starting this channel because I wanted
11:18
to let you guys know that you don't have
11:21
to abandon the books you want to write
11:22
you just have to learn to package them
11:24
and you have to come up with a strategy
11:26
that allows you to put your best foot
11:28
forward when it comes to writing what
11:30
you truly want to write but there is no
11:33
either/or there there's no like you
11:35
either get to be creative and get to be
11:37
an artist who writes what you love or
11:38
you get to make money those things are
11:41
not mutually exclusive that's why I got
11:43
this quote tattooed on my arm that says
11:45
fill your paper with the breathing's of
11:47
your heart and that's why I called this
11:48
heart breathing's because I wanted to
11:50
help you guys know that you can write
11:52
what you love and you can make money
11:54
doing it I'm not saying it's gonna be
11:56
easy but it is possible and I wanted to
11:59
give you guys that hope but when you go
12:01
out there and you're trying to learn how
12:03
to do that on the business side and on
12:05
the craft side of it the art side of it
12:07
then I hope that you will pay attention
12:09
to who you're learning from and make
12:11
sure that whoever that person is their
12:14
values align with yours so for example
12:17
someone who really wanted to learn how
12:19
to make money as fast as possible their
12:21
values may not align with mine and they
12:23
may not enjoy this particular channel
12:25
because I don't really talk about how to
12:27
make as much money as possible what I
12:29
talk about is how to write the books
12:31
that you truly love and how to organize
12:33
your life in a way that makes you happy
12:35
and that gets you through all of this in
12:37
a sane and joyful way and so if that
12:40
aligns with you then maybe I'm exactly
12:42
the kind of person you want to be
12:43
learning from it's important to keep
12:45
learning to keep learning the craft and
12:47
to keep learning about how to run this
12:50
business as best as possible but I can
12:52
promise you that there is always a way
12:55
to write the kind of books that you most
12:58
want to write and still make money doing
13:00
it it just might take learning a little
13:02
bit more trying some new things and
13:04
finding teachers whose goals align with
13:07
yours
13:07
so that is kind of a little soapbox item
Outro
13:10
for me today but it is so important to
13:13
keep learning guys and I hope that you
13:15
will take this part to heart and we only
13:18
have one more video left in
13:20
series so video number eight will be
13:22
coming tomorrow I hope that you will hit
13:25
that notification bellow subscribe to
13:27
this channel so that you'll get notified
13:28

13:30
heart breathing's also I would love for
13:32
you to hit that like button and comment
13:34
down below about what is some of the
13:36
best advice you've ever received as a
13:38
self-published author or as an aspiring
13:40
author if you haven't yet self-published
13:42
so I hope this wasn't one that was a
13:45
little bit too depressing because I did
13:46
kind of stand on that soapbox for a
13:48
while
13:48
but it just bothers my heart to see
13:50
people giving advice that discourages
13:52
you from following your true dreams
13:54
because as we'll talk about in tip
13:56
number eight whether or not you're happy
13:58
doing this is extremely important so
14:01
it's very very important to me
14:04
that you find a way to be happy and to
14:07
also make money so hopefully this will
14:10
inspire you to do so and just continuing
14:13
to learn is a great way to do that and
14:15
if you're here on YouTube looking for
14:17

14:18

14:20

14:22
it for me for today but I will see you

14:31
will see you in the last video at the
14:33
series alright bye
14:35
[Music]

everybody I am here today to talk to you
0:02
real quick about some tips on how to
0:04
reclaim some of your time for writing so
0:07
that you can write every single day okay
0:13
so one of the biggest tips and
0:15
strategies that I really found that
0:17
changed my entire writing career was
0:19
writing sprints and I know a lot of you
0:22
out there do writing sprints this came
0:24
from NaNoWriMo they started doing this
0:26
and I was like okay I'm gonna try this
0:28
and this was way back in like I think
0:30
2008 when I first started doing it they
0:33
were running some writing sprints on
0:35
Twitter and I was like oh my gosh this
0:37
is brilliant
0:38
and then after Nana was over I sort of
0:41
stopped doing it and found that it was
0:44
difficult like if I said to myself okay
0:46
I've got from 10 a.m. to noon to write I
0:50
would come out of that two-hour section
0:53
of writing time with almost nothing done
0:56
and it was like oh my gosh how was it
0:58
that I was getting so much done during
1:00
those you know writing sprints when I
1:03
only had 20 minutes or something to
1:04
write and then I give myself two hours
1:06
and I can't to write anything well I
1:09
don't know I'm sure there's you know
1:11
probably all kinds of studies done on
1:12
the psychology of giving yourself that
1:14
focused time limit and I am NOT gonna go
1:17
into all that but I do know just for
1:19
myself for a personal from a personal
1:21
perspective when I focused my time in
1:24
and I say okay I only have from this
1:26
time to this time to get my writing done
1:28
or it's not getting done at all I'm
1:30
gonna focus in but if I give myself a
1:32
really long stretch of time like two
1:34
full hours to sit down and focus without
1:37
running a timer or tracking my word
1:39
count I will get less done than if I try
1:42
the Pomodoro Technique if you're not
The Pomodoro Technique
1:44
familiar with the Pomodoro Technique
1:46
this was a technique developed in the
1:48
80s by I think a guy named Francis
1:52
Francesco Cirillo I don't know if I'm
1:55
saying that correctly but he developed
1:58
this with a kitchen timer that looked
2:00
like a tomato so that's where Pomodoro
2:02
comes from a tomato in Italian I believe
2:05
so he had that old-fashioned kitchen
2:07
timer and he would turn it to 25 minutes
2:09
and he would work on one single project
2:12
one single focus for those 25 minutes
2:15
and then when the 25 minutes was over he
2:17
would put a little checkmark for one
2:19
session completed and then he would take
2:22
a three to five minute break
2:23
set the timer again and go to work and
2:26
after he finished and had four check
2:29
marks he would take a 15 to 30 minute
2:32
break to just clear his mind to go for a
2:36
walk to go to the bathroom and get some
2:37
coffee whatever and then he would come
2:39
back and start it over so he would work
2:40
in these sections of four 25-minute
2:44
Pomodoro is this why he started calling
2:46
them that's what he called that section
2:48
of time so I started doing some research
2:50
after Nano was over and I was no longer
2:53
following this really great system of
2:55
you know focusing my time it was like
2:58
what in the world was going on and my
3:00
husband was playing this game at the
3:01
time and I cannot remember what it was
3:03
called but it was a it was a science
3:06
fiction game where he would go in and
3:08
you would do a battle and then once the
3:12
battle was over it's like a PvP battle
3:13
once the battle was over you know you
3:15
would get spit back out into a waiting
3:17
room until the next battle began and so
3:19
we started instead of me setting like a
3:21
25 minute timer we started doing this
3:24
thing where it was like okay every time
3:26
he would go into a new battle I would
3:27
start writing and whenever he would get
3:29
out I would see how many words I got and
3:32
it was kind of like a race against
3:34
myself to see if I could get more words
3:36
and we tried to pair it up with his
3:38
points for his battle and it was just
3:40
kind of a fun thing to do and there's
3:42
something about adding that game aspect
3:44
to the writing that like okay no matter
3:47
what I've got 20 minutes or I've got
3:49
this specific amount of time that I'm
3:52
going to focus toward my writing and
3:54
then I'm gonna see what I ended up with
3:56
at the end that makes it somehow more
3:58
fun more focused just plain more
4:02
productive and I think that for me also
4:04
it's a matter of telling myself it
4:06
doesn't matter if the words I write in
4:08
this 25 minutes are any good I may not
4:10
feel like writing but all I'm going to
4:12
do is I'm going to set that 25 minute
4:14
timer and I'm gonna get something done
4:15
no matter what even if it's the worst
4:17
words I've ever written in my life I'm
4:19
going to focus for this 25 minutes and I
4:22
don't allow Facebook pain
4:24
I turn off you know I do listen to music
4:26
a lot of the time but I turn off you
4:28
know Facebook Messenger if somebody text
4:31
me I just ignore it because this is my
4:34
writing time and I know that I have that
4:36
three to five minute break afterward to
4:38
answer them or to get up and get coffee
4:41
or do whatever it is I need to do so
4:43
something about being able to focus my
4:45
time in that manner really helps me be
4:47
more productive the way that the
4:49
original Pomodoro Technique went was
4:51
exactly like I said you do for 25
4:54
minutes prints or Pomodoro's with a five
4:57
minute break in between and then you
4:59
take a longer break like fifteen to
5:01
thirty minutes now for me personally I
5:04
have found that I like to do three
5:06
chunks of time and then the longer break
5:09
because going for that fourth one I
5:11
usually end up with diminishing returns
5:13
because I'm so tired during that fourth
5:15
one I'm just like ready for a break so
5:17
for me I'll do one two three 25-minute
5:20
sprints is what I call them instead of
5:22
Pomodoro's where I'm writing or working
5:24
on something focused for twenty five
5:26
minutes three times in a row then after
5:29
the third one I will take a 15 to 30
5:31
minute break usually more like 15
5:33
minutes then I'll come back and work
5:35
again so here's where we go and we talk
How To Use The Technique
5:38
about how you use this to reclaim some
5:41
of your writing time number one you need
5:44
to identify what time you have during
5:46
the day now it doesn't matter if you're
5:48
working a full-time job if you've got
5:50
children at home and your full time mom
5:52
if you are just super busy working on
5:55
the house or if you maybe you don't even
5:57
have a full-time job but you have a
5:59
part-time job and you're available some
6:00
days but you're not available others
6:02
what I would recommend you do is you sit
6:05
down and you figure out in your schedule
6:07
in your calendar exactly where you have
6:10
time to write the following day or you
6:13
could plan out the entire week I tried
6:15
to keep up with a schedule and a routine
6:17
so that I know all the time what I have
6:19
but I do sit down on Sundays and I plan
6:22
out my entire week and then I went ahead
6:24
and filled this out usually I would do
6:25
this tonight but I did it already so
6:29
that you could see it but I have I use
6:30
that opening and I have a date they have
6:35
daily pages so every night before I
6:37
to bed I would go through these daily
6:39
pages and I would say like here's what
6:41
I'm gonna do and I write out like I
6:44
don't have any meetings or anything
6:46
going on tomorrow but if I did I would
6:47
write out the meetings and everything
6:49
else but what I have identified for
6:51
tomorrow is that I have from 8:00 to
6:53
noon to write so that gives me 4 hours
6:57
from writing time and I may be able to
6:59
find some time throughout the day later
7:02
to write but these are going to be my
7:03
dedicated hours I do this the day before
7:06
because if I get up in the morning and I
7:08
don't have a specific plan for what I'm
7:10
gonna do that day it's not going to get
7:13
done I will always feel too tired I will
7:16
always feel unmotivated and it's not
7:18
going to get done but if I commit to it
7:20
the night before and I say I am writing
7:21
from 8 to noon no matter what if I feel
7:24
like it it doesn't matter I'm going if I
7:26
don't feel like it doesn't matter I'm
7:28
going to get this writing done so I know
7:30
I have from 8 to noon so what I will do
7:33
is I will say ok so that's going to be
7:35
me writing from 8:00 to 8:30 so it'll be
7:38
8 to 8 25 with a 5 minute break to 8:30
7:40
then I'll have a second sprint from 8:30
7:44
to 855 with a 5 minute break so that
7:47
brings me to 9 o'clock then from 9 to
7:49
9:30 is sprint number 3 then I'm going
7:51
to take a break till about 10 o'clock so
7:53
that's three sprints then from 10:00 to
7:56
10:30 10:30 to 11:00 11 to 11:30 that
8:00
gives me 6 Sprint's and then usually
8:02
that last sprint between 11:30 and noon
8:05
is going to be another break and that's
8:07
when I'm going to check up check my
8:09
email for the day see if I've been
8:10
tagged on Facebook and any groups that I
8:12
need to respond to and that sort of
8:14
thing so I will not check my email my
8:16
facebook messages nothing until that
8:19
11:30 to 12 and then I'll stop for lunch
8:22
so I know that during those 4 hours I'm
8:24
going to get 6 Sprint's done so what
8:27
I've already done is written into my
8:29
planner 1 2 3 4 5 6 sprints and then
8:33
what I will do tomorrow is right at 8
8:35
a.m. or as soon as I can after that I
8:38
will sit down and I will start my timer
8:40
now what I have personally is I have an
8:42
app on my phone
8:44
hopefully it will show up a little bit I
8:46
have an app on my phone called the right
8:49
amador a right o meter it's
8:51
WI te om ET ER I don't know if this is
8:55
available on iPhones but it is available
8:58
on Android and I have my writing you
9:01
know my sacrifice me too is what I'm
9:03
working on right now it tells me what my
9:04
daily progress needs to be my overall
9:06
progress and then up here you'll see it
9:08
has a little timer so I will when I'm
9:10
ready to start that timer I will click
9:12
the timer and it goes for 25 minutes
9:15
then at the end of that 25 minutes it
9:17
has a place for me to put in it never
9:21
wants me to stop it is the problem it
9:24
has a place for me put in what word
9:26
count I got so I don't actually have to
9:28
track it like this but I like to be able
9:30
to look back later on paper and see
9:32
exactly what I did just to give you an
9:34
example of how I would do this if I was
9:36
doing you know morning sprint so usually
9:40
on my piece of paper here I'm going to
9:42
write down you know my Sprint's and I'm
9:44
planning to do 6 then I'll write my
9:46
starting word count so let's this is
9:48
just an example so let's just say when I
9:51
sat down today my starting word count
9:53
was already in the document at 27,000
9:56
359 so then I set my timer I do my 25
9:59
minutes and let's say I ended up with
10:02
28,000 110 so I would write down the new
10:07
word count and then I'm going to go to
10:08
my calculator because I do not do math
10:11
in my head and I would just do the 28 1
10:15
1 0 minus 27 359 to get my word count
10:21
for that sprint which would have been
10:23
751 so I just write a little like a
10:28
little less than sign and a 751 which
10:33
gives me the word count for that
10:34
particular sprint then I would start my
10:37
I would take my three minute break I
10:38
would start my timer again and let's say
10:40
I ended up with 2905 2 so then I would
10:46
do the little sign again and I would say
10:51
2905 2 minus 28 1 1 0 which was my
10:55
previous word count and that would give
10:57
me a total for that sprint of 942 so I
11:00
would also write that in
11:02
I would create a third column where I am
11:05
adding together those two sprints and
11:08
saying 942 words plus 751 words gives me
11:12
a total of sixteen hundred and
11:14
ninety-three words so if you see that I
11:17
end up with three columns so what I
11:18
always end up doing is saying you know
11:20
this first column is the actual word
11:23
count in the document now the second
11:26
column is how many words I got that
11:27
particular sprint and then the third
11:29
column is the total words that I've
11:31
written during this entire session
11:33
that's the way I usually keep track of
11:35
it so that by the time I get down to the
11:37
end I can see now what you could do is
11:39
instead of adding up those totals every
11:41
single time is you could just write down
11:44
your new total word count all the way
11:46
through what you could do is instead of
11:48
adding it up or subtracting it every
11:50
single time as you could just take this
11:52
final number 32 oh five six - you're
11:56
starting word count up here at the top
11:58
which was 27 359 and you would know that
12:02
during today's six sprints you wrote
12:05
4697 words but for me I like to see it
12:11
as the day progresses like I it
12:14
encourages me every single time I finish
12:17
a sprint to be able to say wow I got
12:19
another 780 words and that brings me to
12:22
2500 now I know I've got 2500 to go to
12:24
hit my goal or I've got 600 left to hit
12:26
my goal I like seeing that progression
12:28
as the day goes on because it can it
12:31
encourages me to keep going so number
12:34
one if you want to reclaim some of your
12:36
writing time is you need to figure out
12:38
where you have time during the day so
12:41
for me like I said it is figuring out
12:44
the night before where am I gonna have
12:46
time let's say I had a full-time job or
12:48
I had a bunch of things going on
12:50
tomorrow I would just sit down and go
12:52
okay well where where can i reclaim a
12:55
little bit of time for you it might be
12:58
even you know especially if you're super
13:01
busy it might be something like okay I'm
13:03
gonna be waiting in the carpool line
13:04
from two o'clock to 2:30 tomorrow so I'm
13:07
gonna get that one sprint in and I'm
13:09
gonna sit here and do voice dictation on
13:11
my phone or I'm gonna bring my keyboard
13:13
in the in the car and I'm gonna do it
13:15
not where my daughter has swim team
13:17
practice so I'm gonna sit on the
13:19
bleachers and I'm gonna write for those
13:21
two hours while she's swimming whatever
13:23
it is for you you need to identify where
13:25
you have time to write during the day
13:28
and I would look for those chunks of 25
13:30
minutes we can talk about this again
13:32
later
13:32
but you may find that you work better
13:34
with 15-minute Sprint's or some people
13:36
work better with hour-long Sprint's when
13:38
they give themselves the whole hour but
13:40
that's a matter of experimentation and
13:41
I'll cover that in another video how you
13:43
can go about experimenting with those
13:45
timings but for now let's just say the
13:46
25 minute Pomodoro if you can look
13:50
throughout your schedule for tomorrow
13:51
and say where do I have 25 minute
13:53
pockets of time or an hour pocket of
13:56
time where I can split it into two
13:57
Pomodoro's or two writing sprints once
14:00
you are able to start looking at your
14:02
day in that manner and you commit to it
14:04
the night before like okay I have 30
14:07
minutes during my lunch break where I
14:09
could eat really quickly and then take
14:11
you know 30 minutes to write in the
14:14
break room
14:14
then you commit to it and say that's
14:16
what I'm going to do every single day
14:17
then you sit down and you do it that's
14:20
how you start to reclaim your time if
14:22
you just tell yourself maybe I'll sit
14:25
down and do it or I have this like three
14:27
hours when I get home from work I
14:29
guarantee you that when you get home
14:30
from work you're gonna be like too tired
14:32
and there was that show I really wanted
14:34
to watch and I really should also be
14:35
working on this other thing I was
14:37
thinking about and I kind of want to
14:38
read this book you're you're just gonna
14:40
go off in a million different directions
14:42
you have there's something about making
14:44
that commitment to yourself the night
14:45
before where you say this is my you know
14:48
if you really want to watch that TV show
14:50
and you've got this book you really want
14:52
to read and you know you have four hours
14:54
when you get home from work sit down
14:56
first thing you do is say I'm going to
14:58
get these two writing sprints in then I
15:01
can watch that show then I can read that
15:03
book if you don't commit to it you're
15:05
never going to do it but if you start
15:06
looking for where you can reclaim these
15:08
25 minutes here and there in your
15:10
writing schedule you're gonna start
15:11
seeing a lot of opportunity and you're
15:13
going to start seeing those words counts
15:15
go up and up and up because you're going
15:17
to begin to really find that momentum
15:20
and find that commitment that you needed
15:22
now later we're going to also be talking
15:24
about I'm going to show you different
15:25
ways that you can track your word count
15:27
overall like I have a
15:29
wall calendar here that I tracked my
15:31
word count also track it in my Hoban et
15:33
I used to track in my bullet journal so
15:35
I'll show you that but identify that
15:38
time use the Pomodoro Technique where
15:41
you set a timer there are plenty of
15:43
resources online like I was talking
15:45
about this right o meter app that I use
15:47
on my Android so you could look that up
15:49
I can try to link it below if I remember
15:51
there's also Chrome extensions so if you
15:53
write in Google Docs or somewhere in
15:54
your Chrome
15:55
there are chrome extensions that you can
15:57
download for Pomodoro where you can set
15:59
the 25-minute timer or you know what you
16:01
can just take your phone or any other
16:03
timer and click like if I click on top
16:07
clock and then set my timer I can just
16:09
go start and it begins a 25 minute timer
16:12
right here on my phone you don't have to
16:14
get high tech about this you can just
16:16
literally do it like that the guy that
16:19
invented this he was using one of those
16:21
kitchen timers and I actually tried to
16:23
do that but it makes that little sound
16:26
the entire 25 minutes it was driving me
16:28
insane
16:28
so I don't I don't use those anymore but
16:31
I did go and buy pretty one and then I
16:33
wanted to throw it across the room but
16:35
other than that you can just use your
16:36
phone or you can try to download an app
16:38
if you search for Pomodoro Technique you
16:40
will find several apps that you can
16:42
download that will give you that timer
16:44
and not only just the 25 minute timer
16:46
but it will auto set that five minute
16:48
break or whatever but you'll start to
16:50
see over time how you begin to reclaim
16:53
that time and turn it into words just 25
16:57
minutes here and there it doesn't have
16:58
to be three hours worth of time it
17:00
doesn't have to be you know huge chunks
17:04
where you've got all this time you can
17:05
just literally even if it's 10 minutes
17:07
Sprint's for you in the beginning
17:08
because you're just that busy maybe you
17:11
don't have a lot of time when your kids
17:12
are napping or you are working three
17:15
different jobs or you just have very
17:17
little time in between identify the
17:20
moments that you have even if it's 10
17:22
minutes here and there in the carpool
17:23
line at swim practice and stop giving
17:26
yourself the excuse of like I don't feel
17:28
like it or it's too hard to jump in
17:30
train yourself to believe that the
17:32
second you start that timer it's time to
17:35
write and it doesn't matter if those
17:36
words are any good it doesn't matter if
17:38
they're usable if you're going to end up
17:39
throwing
17:39
way later start that timer sit down and
17:42
record it and I promise you you will
17:45
start to get into the habit of
17:47
reclaiming this time for yourself
17:48
alright guys I hope this has helped a
17:51
little bit I am going to have another
17:53
video later in the week that shows you
17:56
how I use my simplified planner to use
17:59
to do these Pomodoro's not just with my
18:03
writing time but with all my marketing
18:05
and everything - so that I don't spend
18:06
off too much time on social media when I
18:09
should be marketing so I'm going to go
18:10
over how I color code my days and my
18:13

you
World building setting the time and place of our story all of that can often
0:05
seem like background information just the backdrop of our story world and for
0:10
some novels that's maybe all it really is but if you really want to create a story world that your readers want to
0:18
just step into and they wish they could live there where your characters really come alive then you need to spend some
0:25
time thinking about your world building and this is not just for magic systems and big fantasy worlds there's a lot of
0:31
World building that goes into small town contemporary stories or cozies or detective stories or horror even if your
0:39
setting is just one single haunted house there's still a lot of World building that you might need to think about of
0:45
course if you are writing an Epic Fantasy or a multi-book series there might be more World building involved
0:51
especially if there's magic or paranormal but what we're going to talk about today is this idea of World
0:56
building what it is what you need to take into consideration how much of it you need to have planned before you
1:01
start your book setting which is more just the time and place and environment
1:07
your story takes place in more specifically and then also description how do you describe this world once you
1:14
get into your book so if you're excited for this I am to it is preptober 2023
1:19
and we're going to talk about some World [Music]
1:25
building First Things First World building is really every everything about your story world that affects your
1:32
characters or that your readers need to know in order to get what's happening in this story so that's literally
1:39
everything not just this house that your character is sitting in but it's the culture that your character lives in
1:44
it's the population so for some books it's even the geography or the technology it's the history of the place
1:51
the wars of a place it could be the weather that happens here it could be the supply chain and economics it could
1:56
be the religion the language literally everything that comes into your story and of course how deep you go into that
2:03
it's really going to depend on your genre and your particular story there are some stories that happen everything
2:10
in one tiny room and then there are stories that take place across multiple
2:15
Generations so it's going to depend on you how much World building you need to do and sometimes we're going to discover
2:22
that as we go through the story so don't freak out and think that you have to have all of this figured out before
2:28
November 1st or before you start wrting your book because that is not true when we talk about setting though we're
2:34
talking more about what's the time period this is set in or the temporal setting what is the actual location so
2:43
what's the place that this is set in and this can be uh country it can be the
2:48
city or town and it could be even just which rooms or which house this is happening so it could be a very specific
2:54
interior setting or it could also include the world setting itself
3:00
or the environment which is sort of a grander view of the weather and types of
3:05
things that are affecting your character's world on a bigger scale sometimes people will also include
3:11
psychological setting meaning because so much of our stories often happen Inside
3:17
the Mind of a certain character sometimes their psychology can also be a setting of its own we're not even going
3:23
to dive into that into this video we're going to pay attention more to things external to our characters like time and
3:29
place place or location description obviously is just how we describe that
3:35
with words on the page so we're using our five senses here and we're showing what do we see what do we hear what's
3:41
the smell of this place what is the feeling or general tone of it and what are the textures and the things that we
3:47
can move around or touch and so all of this stuff is going to play a part in
3:52
our world building now if you're new to this Channel and you aren't familiar
My Experience As An Author
3:58
with me and you're wondering okay well what's your your expertise on World building my name is Sarah Cannon I am
4:03
the author of 27 novels almost finished with book number 28 I just finished my
4:09
second round of edits on that book and I have written mostly young adult
4:14
contemporary portal fantasies so that means part of my stories happen here in our contemporary world but with
4:21
speculative elements like witches paranormal ghosts like different things like that depending on the story and
4:27
then most of my stories include some kind of portal to another world so my popular Shadow Demon Saga goes from our
4:34
contemporary world into a portal to a place called The Shadow World which is a fantasy world filled with Shadow Demons
4:42
but it's not just fantasy or speculative type stories that have World building to
4:47
them I also am the author of The Fair Hope series which is a completed new adult contemporary series set in a small
4:54
town in Georgia and this still has a lot of World building because because it has
5:00
to do with the characters their relationships to each other the culture of that town and a lot of other things
5:06
like their economics and the history and the culture of that place and so there's still a lot of World building that goes
5:12
into contemporary stories in terms of building up the town or the tone or the
5:18
environment and history and the rich location of an area so don't count yourself out of World building just
5:24
because you're writing contemporary stories so those are just a few examples
5:29
of what I've written and at this point I have sold over 1 million copies of my books yay and that is a recent Milestone
5:37
that I've achieved and so I do have quite a bit of experience at creating worlds so what we're going to talk about
5:43
first is what does World building entail and how much of it do you need to know before you start your story sometimes
Start High Level :When & Where
5:51
people get setting and World building confused but really setting is just one Piece of Your World building so the
5:58
World building is every everything about your character's World in terms of their
6:04
history the politics potentially the rules of this world especially if we're talking about a magical system the
6:10
locations and the actual physical buildings the layout of your town or the layout of your country could be the
6:16
geography it could be the animals or creatures nature magic the weather
6:22
culture trade and supplies language the religion of a place the population of a
6:27
place their beliefs their myths conflicts or Wars economics all of these
6:33
types of things go into your world building but how deep you go into this
6:38
and how much of this you actually need to know really depends on the type of story that you're writing so if you
6:45
already have decided a few things about your story or even if you've already begun plotting Your Story one of the
6:50
first things you're going to do is go high level with where is this story
6:55
taking place so a lot of times when we're World building we start with setting so we say where is this
7:01
happening on a big level what country is this in is this a madeup place is this a
7:06
fantasy world what type of fantasy world is this in terms of is it a high fantasy
7:12
world where there are elves and dwarves and it's very Lord of the Rings or is this more of a fairy world what are we
7:19
looking at here another question when it comes to World building is when is this story taking place is it happening in a
7:26
contemporary time period or is it set in the 1950s in Oklahoma that is going to have a very different feel and the level
7:32
of research and detail you're going to need to put in there in order for your reader to really feel like they're a
7:37
part of it is going to be very different so if you're writing just a contemporary New York City a lot of people in the
7:43
world are already going to be familiar with what New York City looks like and
7:49
feels like from television movies and other books that have been around however if you're writing medieval
7:55
castle you might have to put in more detail as to exactly which time and place and what's the politics and the
8:01
culture like there so that people will understand the motivations and why your characters are reacting to certain
8:06
things the way that they are because people were very different technology is another piece of world Building
8:11
Technology was very different in medieval times a lot of times too even if you are writing something that is
8:18
fantasy and something that is not set in our real world if it's even a fantasy world if you look at something like Lord
8:24
of the Rings or Game of Thrones those authors were still anchoring their stories in history here in our world and
8:32
so you might have something like Game of Thrones that's based on something like medieval times and the culture of that
8:38
time but it's set in a fantasy world so that author is able to draw elements from history real life history and then
8:45
weave in his own elements to that story and the same thing is true when we're writing any type of fantasy or
8:53
paranormal or speculative things like science fiction or horror or witches or anything like that that is that we often
9:00
will basee it in a world that we understand as readers that most people will understand and then we weave those
9:06
magical and Fantastical elements on top of those things so a lot of that
9:12
beginning stage of World building is just saying what type of world are we dealing with here and then asking
9:18
yourself I'm going to give you a list here at the end of this video that you can grab from Google Docs that I made
9:24
just for things to think about when you're World building in terms of religion technology and all those things
9:29
I listed earlier if you want to be able to reference that and just start asking yourself which of these pieces do I
9:36
think right now before I start writing are going to affect my characters or my story World in some way are my
9:42
characters going to need to travel across the United States and if so how
9:48
much of that weather or culture or situation do I need to understand so for example I have a series called The
9:55
Eternal sorrow series it's another portal fantasy but part of but the majority of the books take place here in
10:01
the United States but it's after the zombie apocalypse so we have a postapocalyptic scenario which is our
10:10
characters are making a trek from the DC area to New York City and so I had to do some research and World building not
10:17
based on what is actually happening in the world but what people think would happen if we lost access to phones and
10:23
internet and that kind of thing and that was super super fun to be able to do that but it was anchored of course in
10:29
our everyday world and then I had to weave these imaginary things on top of it based on other people's predictions
10:35
things we've seen in movies and things that readers would already be familiar with so as you go down that list and you
10:42
think about the story that you're trying to create and the world where this is set I want you to start to make lists of
10:49
things that would potentially affect your story so is there going to be something about the actual land itself
10:56
that is going to play a role in your story so this could be that there's like in My Shadow Demon Saga there are Woods
11:03
surrounding the house where my main character goes to live at the very beginning of the series and those woods
11:09
and the Earth around it are filled with this sort of magical energy that she draws from and so that becomes a part of
11:15
the culture of this world and I needed to explain the way that that felt and the way those woods looked and how dense
11:21
they are so that's the first things first we start with the big picture of where is this happening when is this
11:27
happening which is going to tell you how much research you may have to do into a historical time period if you need or is
11:33
there any historical time period that is playing a role in what's happening in my
11:38
story even if it's contemporary then you can start to drill down more
11:43
specifically into these specific categories like religion and Technology
11:49
now this is where the procrastination can come in is that sometimes we can
11:54
start brainstorming lots of things about oh the technology the religion the
11:59
language the people and some of this stuff will make it onto the page and some of it won't so I think that one of
12:06
the warnings I have for you about World building is do as much as feels
12:11
necessary for you use your intuition but also be self-aware that you're not
12:18
spending just six months a year doing nothing but World building and not
Procrastination warning
12:23
actually writing your story unless that was your intention so put some time limits on to Your World building and
12:29
remember that you don't have to have all of this figured out before your Story begins that you can also start writing
12:35
and then as you're writing you're going to come across things that you're like oh I guess I'm going to have this setting here that's this Hospital in DC
12:42
what does that hospital look like what's the floor plan and then you'll have to do some extra research as you're writing
12:48
so be open to both what do you need to know ahead of time to get started and then how much of this will you begin to
12:54
figure out as you write now as you start asking yourself like what are the politics ICS of this area what's the
Decide The Scope
13:00
language of this area some of it might come to you really easily because you've already put a lot of thought into the
13:05
characters that you have and the setting might already play such a huge role in terms of maybe it's set in Africa and
13:12
you know know certain types of languages that you need and certain types of geography or culture or history or war
13:18
or politics that you're going to have to deal with because it's written into your plot and you know that your readers are
13:23
going to need to understand it before they can understand your character's motivations or the state of the story
13:30
but there's also going to be situations where you're like I don't know I'm setting this in a fictional small town in the middle of Texas and there's not
13:37
really a lot of World building because I don't want to bring politics and everyone here speaks English so there's not a lot of language maybe there's some
13:43
dialect here that I might want to pull in but really it's just the culture of this small town and so something you can
13:49
think about from the beginning is what is the scope of my world building how big is this world how many locations is
13:55
it going to take place in and where do I need to focus in and then go down this list and think which of these things do
14:01
I immediately know are going to play a role in my world in terms of my
14:07
characters world and World building really is all about making sure that your readers understand what's happening
14:12
and why your characters are doing the things they're doing or why this environment is affecting your characters
14:18
in this way and like I said that's going to come down to the type of story that you're writing so as you go through this
14:25
list just give that highlevel opinion of okay this is definitely going to be important this is not important this is
14:32
important and I need to start making some decisions and go ahead and write down everything that you already know
14:37
you either need to research or that you need to decide and any decisions you've already made so far so that you have a
14:43
starting document this can be something that I feel is better to do in digital format rather than writing down just
14:50
because you're going to expand on these ideas and you want to make sure that you don't lose them on just some random
14:55
sticky notes or anything so I'd recommend either starting a Google doc or a word doc or opening up scrier and
15:01
doing your world building in some kind of digital document so that you don't have to constantly erase or be writing
15:07
in the margins or deleting things and so forth another important thing to think about when it comes to Fantasy or
Rules & Magic
15:14
science fiction or anything that is not set specifically in uh the real world
15:19
that most readers would be familiar with is what are the rules of this world when
15:25
you start talking about magic systems or space travel or even just if we're
15:32
sitting in a lab in a computer lab with a set of chemistry people what are the rules of this particular setting or this
15:39
particular world that govern my character's actions my character's power
15:44
my character's agency in this world what are the rules here now when it comes to magic rules I am not going to be able to
15:53
go into how to create an entire magic system in this particular video but I
15:58
will point you in the description to some other resources that will help you with magic systems just because it can
16:05
be really tough to create Magic systems and it can be tough to make sure that they're balanced and that they work and
16:11
that the rules are consistent across a series so that would be probably a potential entire series here on YouTube
16:17
but I will link some good resources that are a good place to start but if you are going to have a magic system like in My
16:24
Shadow Demons World witches use Shadow Demons as batteries for magic and there
16:29
are gemstones and there are you know different types of creature Magic and different things
16:35
like that that get used through that series and I had to build that system in a way that felt like it was consistent
16:42
and it was realistic in my eternal sorrow series it's Elemental Magic and so going back to other stories that use
16:49
Elemental Magic like certain anime or even cartoons like The Last Airbender or
16:54
other types of series that have strong Elemental Magic was a great resource for me to see what other authors have done
17:00
and then turn it and make it my own but that is also a great resource is reading other books in your genre like fantasy
17:07
to sort of understand how that World building works or how those rules work
Get More Specific
17:12
so once you have that high level view you start to narrow down and you start to look at each of the individual Pieces
17:18
Of Your World building and also setting so this is probably one of the most important pieces of Your World building
17:25
is the specific setting of your book so setting is like I said it could be the
17:31
environment so it could be everything that's around your character's world like geographically or the location but
17:38
it can also be a very specific setting like inside a house or inside someone's
17:44
office and so we've got multiple layers potentially of setting so we have maybe
17:49
this room we have the house as a whole we have the grounds outside of it then
17:54
we have the city and then maybe you're also going to see the state so sit and think about in this book so far when I
18:00
think about the plot that I have laid out how much how many layers of setting
18:05
do I need specific setting all the way out to a bigger setting now with my Shadow Demon Saga in the first book we
18:12
see the interior of Harper's room her high school we see the town of
18:17
peachville but we don't really see outside of peachville she has some memories of her life in Atlanta but we
18:22
don't really have a physical setting on the page outside of the town of peachville and there are very specific
18:28
settings there like the grounds of shatterford home for girls and her high school and that's most of where the book
18:34
is set and so it's easy to just take one single sheet in my Google Docs and say Here's Shadow for home for girls and I'm
18:41
going to write out everything that I know something else I really love to do is to go on to Pinterest and create a
18:46
Pinterest board that's called shadford home for girls or Harper's bedroom or Harper's high school and find other
18:52
images on the web that remind me of the type of place I'm trying to build these
18:58
visual images help me to then figure out how I'm going to describe how is my
19:03
setting or my high school slightly different from this one what do I need this High School to be set up like in
19:10
order for the events of my story to happen so for example there's a big important event that happens at a
19:16
football game so I know I need a football stadium I need a parking lot because that's where she meets with Jackson for the first time so there's
19:22
going to be specific settings that you'll need and you can either jot those down as you're writing and then make
19:28
note of how you've described them so you can stay consistent over time and that's more of a series Bible type action or
19:35
you can figure all of this stuff out before and then reference it as you're writing and in fact I find that the more
19:40
I can figure out within reason before I start writing the easier the story is to write because it I have to make less
19:47
decisions as I'm writing when I'm making decisions about character Arc and plot and dialogue I don't have to think about
19:53
what does this High School look like and how is it set up and I find that to help speed things along with my writing like
19:59
I said figure out how many layers you have to your story and then start with
Build In Layers
20:05
the biggest layer or the smallest layer and work your way backwards or forwards depending on where you want to start so
20:10
let's say I'm going to start with the town of peachville this is a fictitious town but it's based on the town I grew
20:17
up in Hawkinsville and so I could sit down and I could create a map and I could sit and think about what types of
20:22
trees sidewalks what are the roads like here how many people live here and start doing that world build within my setting
20:29
so I'm going to think about peachville and I'm going to think about all those aspects of World building religion
20:36
population their past conflicts the culture of the place the racial makeup
20:41
the social norms I'm going to think about all those things how many people go to the local high school how many people still live there that went to
20:48
high school there is it that kind of small town how many people know each other and how weird is it that this girl
20:53
is coming from Atlanta to live here as like a in a home for troubled girls like how much of an outcast is that going to
20:59
make her in this small town versus what it would have been like for her in Atlanta and so really figuring all that
21:05
out for the big town and that does include like specifics of the setting like the buildings and how tall are the
21:12
buildings how many apartments are there versus homes are their historical homes here all of this stuff does come into
21:18
play with the setting and the World building and then once I have just brainstormed as much of that as possible
21:24
now I'm going to go to a more specific setting like the high school and I'm going to start to think about what the
21:30
layout of that high school is what are the smells are there is there a lot of grass is there AstroTurf are there
21:36
tennis courts what pieces of this might come into play like for me when I started to Envision that high school I
21:42
could see a statue of a demon and I thought oh my gosh that statue matches one that's on the grounds of shadford
21:47
and how do these play into each other so going through this process of figuring out your setting can not only be really
21:54
really fun and creative but it can also start to give you ideas for what's going to happen in your plot and this is where
22:00
the magic starts to happen as well then you can go even more granular so one of
22:05
the most pivotal scenes in the first book of beautiful Demons of the Shadow Demon Saga which is called Beautiful
22:11
demons happens in the high school cafeteria it's not a very long scene it's a pretty short scene and I don't
22:17
even get into too much description of what's happening in that scene but you get an idea of the way the tables are
22:24
set up how the girls come into the room how Harper has to cross in front of the popular girls table to get to put her
22:30
lunch tray away we get all of that stuff because I could see it in my head in terms of where she's sitting how the
22:35
tables are arranged and how that room is arranged and then you can begin to map
22:41
out those specific locations so I would have the high school cafeteria then I also have Harper's bedroom and I have
22:47
the entire Woods that surround shadower and what is the kitchen look like and where does she eat her breakfast so
22:54
start to think about all the small locations where your story takes place or where your characters are going to
23:00
appear in the current book that I'm writing it's called The Disappearance of Vanessa Shaw the setting is very very
23:05
small so everything happens in this story in the present timeline in this
23:11
one location of a cabin on the river in the woods and everything that happens in
23:16
the past timeline happens in and around that cabin or in the town itself where
23:21
they live and so it's very small setting I didn't have to know a lot of things there's just a few rooms some Woods the
23:28
river itself and a few other locations but it can be super helpful to create visuals of it to sit down and describe
23:35
that so let's talk a little bit about description one of the best things that you can do for yourself when it comes to
Description
23:40
description is sit down with a Google doc or whatever you have open for each
23:46
location of setting in your book the specific locations and start to think
23:52
about your five senses so we're talking about sight we're looking at the lighting of a room we're talking about
23:57
about the visuals the things that someone can actually see with their eyes and that is going to not only paint a
24:03
picture for the reader but it's also going to give a tone of the location the
24:09
way that you describe it we're going to think about sound so what is your character hearing are there birds in the
24:15
forest or is everything dead quiet is it a really noisy place like the football stadium there's just people talking
24:22
there's cheerleaders there's football players clapping you know all these different things cars are honking so think about the sound that's really also
24:29
going to enrich your story a lot with the sounds of each setting think about
24:34
the smell so the smell inside Harper's room that's filled with antique furniture and dark mahogany might be
24:40
very different than the smell out in the woods near this um interesting magical
24:45
location with this statue right so think about the smells and even the feel of
24:52
things so as she's walking through the woods is there a light Breeze blowing through the trees and you can hear the leaves rust Ling so we also have things
24:59
that we're hearing so as you write down each location mark down your five senses
25:06
of sight sound smell touch and taste and see if any of those start to bring up
25:14
different descriptions about this area now obviously taste is not going to be something that comes up probably as
25:20
often as what you see but don't forget especially the smell and the sound and
25:25
the texture and the way things feel to your characters because that is what is going to make this world feel real so
Final Tips
25:32
biggest tips before we go number one I have left a Google doc I didn't put this into the preptober planner but I do have
25:39
a 95 page preptober and nanor rimo planner for you if you want to grab it you can just sign up for my newsletter
25:45
list down below and I will send you that along with worksheets on how to Plot a novel how to edit a novel and so on but
25:51
I didn't put this setting worksheet or Google doc in there for you because I wanted you to do it digitally instead of
25:59
writing it out by hand so I have created that so go check it out it's linked Down Below in the description of this video
26:05
you will just click on that Google doc link and it will take you to a page where you can make a copy of it so that
26:10
you can use it for yourself or you can print it out or whatever you need to do but that is going to have some of these
26:16
basics of the World building and setting and some questions that you want to ask yourself but I want to leave you with a
26:21
few tips before we go number one start high level where is the set when is this
26:28
set what in the world does my reader need to know or understand about this world in order to understand the
26:34
sequence of events and my character motivations that's where you start second think about the central conflict
26:42
of your story and the specific settings of each scene in your story that you know so far and go down the list and
26:50
figure out which pieces of World building and setting you are going to need to start with in your story in
26:56
order for you to start writing and write as start as high level as you can and then narrow yourself down to where
27:02
you're describing the sounds the sights the feel the touch the taste of everything that's happening in that
27:08
location and that's going to help you write faster once you get started but
27:13
another big tip is you do not have to have all of this figured out before you start have fun with it figure out as
27:19
much of it as you can within reason don't procrastinate doing it but just figure out however much feels intuitive
27:26
to you and then it will naturally weave itself into the story but my next tip is
27:32
that as you begin writing make sure that you have some sort of method to capture
27:37
the questions that you have as it comes up so that you don't have to sit down and research every little question so
27:43
let's say you had all these settings figured out and then suddenly a scene pops up where your character goes into a
27:49
church and you did not have this church in your original World building or setting but now you're thinking maybe
27:55
religion and this specific Church is going to play a role and you don't have time during nanoro to sit and think
28:01
through all of that how are you going to make a note for yourself where are you going to note that down so that you know
28:07
to do research later I put those notes directly into my manuscript I will do XX
28:14
Capital XX which then is something that doesn't occur naturally in my actual writing so I can do a search and replace
28:20
or find all when I'm done with nanor rimo and I can search for xx and that's going to show me all the places in my
28:26
Google doc that I have questions that need to be researched so I might not describe this
28:32
church very much except what comes to my imagination as I'm writing but I'll put XX describe this church or figure out
28:39
what religion this is or how this plays a role and then I'll go back in my editing and do that so I don't stop the
28:45
flow of my writing and finally give yourself permission to put as little or
28:51
as much World building as you feel is necessary for your story some people are
28:56
writing literary or high fantasy and they love the world building so if you
29:01
read Robert Jordan who is one of my favorite authors literally everything from the character's braids to exact
29:08
clothing of each culture within that story in The Wheel of Time is described in detail it's a lot of World building a
29:16
lot of description and it's very helpful throughout the story to understand that oh that's this kind of person or that
29:22
person's from here or they're one of these people and that has is a way to connect this really big story world but
29:28
if you read Orson Scott Card there's almost no description it's very Li
29:35
handed when it comes to the description but you still can see this world vividly through the character's eyes I also
29:42
don't put a ton of detailed description into my books but people still say they can see my stories happening like a
29:48
movie in their mind even though I'm not describing every little detail of her strand of hair sometimes I don't even
29:55
say what character color hair they have or anything else about them sometimes I keep it really light and you but you
30:01
still get an idea of these characters so feel free to do it the way that you best
30:07
want to do it listen to feedback from your editors but don't feel pressure to put in tons of World building and in
30:13
fact sometimes too much World building can really slow your story down and make it more boring so make sure that you're
30:19
staying true to your pacing which we will talk about later in preptober a lot of information covered in this one short
30:26
video but I hope this was helpful if you have any more questions about World building which is such a huge topic feel
30:31
free to leave them down below and I will answer as many as I can also if you're looking for a great course on World
30:37
building my friend Leslie Penelope has a course on World building that I would highly recommend to you so I'm going to put her website and information for you
30:44
down below as well and don't forget to grab your free Google doc your free prep over planner when you sign it for my
30:50
newsletter and don't forget to subscribe like this video and come back for more because we have lots of not only
30:56
previous years preptober content but also more to come in 2023 if you're looking for a craft book specifically
31:03
about description or setting this one is one that I started out with in my own writing Journey years and years ago so
31:09
this is part of the WR great fiction series it's called description and setting and it's by Ron Roselle so I
31:15
will link that for you down below this doesn't go as much into like a lot of World building but it does talk a lot
31:21
about description which I think is hard for some people so I will link that for you down below as well if you know of
31:27
any other great world building resources other than the ones I've shared in the description go ahead and put them in the comments Let's help each other out and
31:33
find success this Nano so I will see you in my next video bye for [Music]
31:51
now
we are almost halfway through the year
0:01
and that means that a lot of us are
0:04
sitting here looking at that last six
0:07
months of the year and thinking how can
0:09
I make this the six months that I follow
0:12
through on my biggest dreams that I
0:14
start to actually see momentum and start
0:17
to change my life well I have three
0:20
major reasons today why you might not be
0:23
following through with the plans that
0:25
you've made in the past and how you can
0:27
change that for the last half of this
0:30
year and truly change your life forever
0:35
thank you
0:38
so raise your hand if you have made
0:41
elaborate plans in the past goals you've
0:44
set goals you've decided the person you
0:46
want to be you've gotten everything in
0:48
order and then
0:50
when it comes time to actually follow
0:51
through you just haven't been able to do
0:54
it
0:55
this was my life for so very long and
0:59
after working on myself for a very long
1:03
time researching lots of productivity
1:05
tools and working with thousands of
1:07
students now in my hb90 course I have
1:11
some reasons why you might not be
1:14
following through and some solutions for
1:16
you that I want to share today that I'm
1:18
hopeful will really help you so one of
Your Plan Is Impossible
1:21
the first reasons you might not be
1:22
following through is that your plan is
1:25
impossible
1:26
this is really confusing for us
1:29
sometimes because we sit down we think
1:32
we've created the perfect plan but I
1:35
really and truly feel like when we plan
1:38
we are pretending or kind of trying on a
1:43
different personality that we are
1:46
getting super optimistic about this time
1:48
I'm gonna really follow through this
1:50
time I'm gonna do the routine this time
1:52
I'm gonna be different this time I'm
1:54
going to write 3 000 words a day instead
1:55
of a thousand and it's almost as if
1:59
we're planning for a different person
2:01
we're planning for this paper doll
2:03
Pinterest worthy you know that girl
2:05
whatever perfect version of ourselves
2:08
and we think we're gonna have better
2:11
habits this time I'm gonna have better
2:12
routines this time I'm gonna actually
2:15
follow through 100 I'm gonna get up
2:16
early I'm going to not be so distracted
2:19
by my phone and we sit down and we
2:21
create a plan
2:22
that doesn't really take into account
2:25
how we are now it's as if we're planning
2:27
to Quantum Leap into this better version
2:30
of ourselves without actually creating
2:33
that person without creating those
2:34
habits so we're planning for habits we
2:36
don't even have yet and I have been
2:39
notorious about doing this in my past as
2:42
well is I would sit down with my plan
2:44
and my color code and I would get
2:46
excited and it would be like this
2:49
putting on rose-colored glasses and I
2:50
was planning for this better version of
2:52
myself the version of myself I wish I
2:55
could be and I would create my plan for
2:57
her hoping that she was going to show up
2:59
on day one and save me from this life of
3:03
feeling frustrated that I never follow
3:05
through with my goals
3:06
but day one of the plan executing it
3:10
following through with it I wasn't that
3:12
person and she didn't show up and so it
3:15
was always frustrating because I would
3:17
get one or two weeks into my plan and
3:19
I'm already so far behind I'm not
3:21
following through and that just made me
3:23
feel worse and worse about myself so why
3:26
do we do this to ourselves let me know
3:28
in the comments if you have been guilty
3:30
of doing this as well why do we do this
3:33
my theory is one that we're scared we're
3:37
scared that we're running out of time
3:38
that we're already too late that if we
3:40
don't accomplish this as fast as
3:42
possible that we're never going to be
3:44
able to accomplish it we're too old we
3:46
missed the boat we're too young we don't
3:48
have the right experience like I have to
3:50
get it done in the next 90 days or it's
3:52
never going to happen for me or we see
3:54
examples of other people living that
3:56
life and we think I need to get there as
3:58
fast as possible and when we put that
4:00
time pressure on ourselves and we tell
4:02
ourselves if I don't do it I'll never do
4:05
it if I don't do it fast I'll never do
4:07
it then we create unrealistic plans that
4:11
don't really meet us where we are and so
4:13
it's like self-sabotage basically we're
4:16
creating plans out of fear that we're
4:18
not going to be this person and then the
4:19
joke's on us because we if we want to be
4:22
that perfect version of ourselves that
4:24
person with better habits and better
4:26
routines we have to actually take the
4:28
time to create and cultivate those
4:30
habits
4:31
and we so often don't do that we just
4:34
want to become that person overnight so
4:36
that fear is there and believe me I
4:38
relate to that so much
4:40
another reason besides just that we're
4:43
afraid we're going to run out of time is
4:45
that when we sit down to plan we get
4:47
excited for the possibilities of our
4:49
lives and we're planning often from that
4:52
place of excitement for that outcome
4:55
that we're going to achieve oh my
4:56
goodness if I could just finish this
4:57
novel think of how my life could be and
5:00
so then we want that effect now so it's
5:02
kind of uh instant gratification issue
5:06
and it could be a mixture of both those
5:08
things which seem like they're at odds
5:09
with each other like fear and excitement
5:11
but often they do exist inside of us and
5:14
we say okay I'm scared I'm going to run
5:16
out of time but I'm so excited that if I
5:19
could just follow through this one time
5:20
I could change my whole life and we end
5:23
up creating a plan that isn't realistic
5:25
we plan for the person we wish we were
5:28
we plan for the time we wish we had
5:30
rather than planning for our reality and
5:34
it can be a very sobering experience to
5:36
sit down and plan for the migraines the
5:39
responsibilities the lack of time the
5:42
lack of energy the days when you're not
5:43
going to feel great like it can be hard
5:45
to plan that way but when we plan to be
5:48
perfect all the time we're just really
5:50
setting ourselves up for getting even
5:52
more behind for not following through
5:54
and the other thing that sometimes makes
5:57
our plans impossible is like I said
5:59
we're planning for the time we wish we
6:01
had so we're just thinking okay I've got
6:03
this project do I think I can finish
6:05
that in the next couple months yeah that
6:07
seems achievable and then we take an
6:10
entirely different project project B and
6:12
we say well does that seem achievable in
6:14
90 days yeah that could be done
6:16
and we don't consider the fact that
6:18
we're trying to do both of these big
6:20
projects in the same 90 days we're just
6:22
thinking okay this this one I'm going to
6:24
take this one in a vacuum I'm going to
6:26
look at only project C can I finish that
6:28
in the next couple months yeah I could
6:30
do that and before we know it we have
6:32
six huge projects that are going to take
6:34
90 days and we think we're going to do
6:36
them all in the same 90 days and instead
6:38
what we've ended up doing is putting 540
6:41
days worth of plans on our plate for the
6:44
next three months and then when it's
6:47
impossible to follow through because we
6:49
can't work 75 hours a day we blame
6:52
ourselves and we say we're lazy and we
6:54
look at as evidence that we can't ever
6:56
follow through that we're not good
6:57
enough that we're running out of time
6:58
that we're getting so behind and that
7:01
just completes this negative cycle so
The Solution
7:04
what's the solution well for me the best
7:08
most effective solution has been to
7:10
create a plan that meets me where I am
7:13
that's takes into consideration the time
7:16
I need to spend with the kids the time
7:17
cleaning the house the grocery shopping
7:19
I have to do the fact that once a month
7:21
I'm maybe having a really bad day
7:24
those kinds of plans can sometimes feel
7:27
difficult because we wish we had more
7:30
time we wish we had more habits that
7:33
supported us we wish we had better
7:34
routines but what I find is that if I
7:37
can let go of that expectation of myself
7:40
to be perfect and to go fast and to get
7:42
it all done at once that when I meet
7:45
myself where I am and I say okay I'm not
7:47
going to be this perfect Pinterest Sarah
7:49
I'm just gonna be me
7:51
and I really look at the time that I
7:53
have then I can effectively plan for
7:57
what is my main priority here what are
7:59
the main things I want to get done and
8:01
that's when I stop wasting my time on
8:03
comparing myself to other people putting
8:05
things on my plate that really aren't
8:07
going to move the needle I get really
8:09
hyper focused on okay if this is all the
8:11
time I have how do I make the absolute
8:14
most of it and that starts to build
8:16
momentum and I'm going to talk about
8:18
momentum a little bit later but creating
8:20
a plan that meets me where I am that
8:22
plans for the time I actually have and
8:24
the routines and habits I actually have
8:26
right now
8:27
makes it achievable and the more I start
8:30
to realize that it's possible and it is
8:32
achievable the more I naturally follow
8:34
through with it so try that on for
8:37
yourself and of course if you want a
8:39
step-by-step guide of how to do this you
8:41
can grab my hb90 planner on Etsy or if
8:44
you're watching this as it comes out
8:46
originally hb90 bootcamp is open for
8:48
enrollment for this Sunday so you just
8:50
have a couple more days to join or it
8:52
will be open at the end of every quarter
8:54
to plan for the next upcoming quarter
8:56
and I promise you this will give you a
8:59
whole new look at how to plan for your
9:01
time and how to make your plans
You Focus on A Vague Outcome
9:03
achievable reason number two you're not
9:05
following through with your plan is
9:07
because you're only focused on this big
9:10
bag final outcome so what I mean by this
9:14
is that instead of giving yourself clear
9:17
small micro tasks or micro actions you
9:21
just have this big idea of what it is
9:23
you want to accomplish so an example
9:25
might be I just want to publish a book
9:28
by the end of this year and in some ways
9:30
that sounds really simple and it sounds
9:32
really clear but when you sit down to
9:34
work on that goal
9:36
where do you even start should I work on
9:38
my writing is this the right book to
9:40
write what should my pen name be so what
9:43
this might look like in a typical day is
9:45
you've got two hours that you've set
9:47
aside to write you sit down
9:49
but you're not 100 clear how much you
9:52
need to write right now it just feels
9:54
like I need to get it done as quickly as
9:55
possible so maybe you write a little bit
9:57
but then you also start to think oh my
9:59
gosh I really should be starting on my
10:01
website and maybe I should post this to
10:03
social media because I need to start
10:05
building up my social media following so
10:07
because you have all these other tasks
10:10
that go along with publishing your book
10:11
when you sit down to write it feels like
10:15
I've got all these thousands of tasks
10:17
that are kind of distracting me in my
10:20
brain you might sit down to write 90 000
10:22
words but it feels so big how do I even
10:25
get this done I'm not even sure what I'm
10:27
doing so then we try to soothe ourselves
10:29
by going to social media and it feels
10:32
like research because we really should
10:34
be more active on on Tick Tock and then
10:37
we think okay I could actually record a
10:39
tick tock real quick of how my desk
10:41
looks or what my writing process is like
10:43
so you post that real quick even though
10:45
you haven't been very active lately and
10:47
you're not really building your social
10:48
media a following and then you notice
10:51
that some other author on there is
10:53
talking about her new book and so you go
10:55
to her website to go look at it and then
10:57
you think oh my goodness I should be
10:59
working on my own website so then you
11:01
spend 45 minutes to an hour stuck in a
11:03
rabbit hole of Wix versus Squarespace
11:06
versus WordPress and then you start to
11:08
realize I can't even start a website
11:10
until I have a brand so you're off to
11:12
Pinterest to start looking at branding
11:14
boards and then you start getting into
11:16
well should I use Pinterest is that
11:19
something that would help me as an
11:20
author and before you know it you've
11:22
followed this rabbit hole
11:24
from one to another to another and
11:26
you've spent your two hours that you
11:28
could have been writing or working on
11:30
your website or building your brand or
11:32
whatever it is you could do in a focused
11:34
manner instead you've been kind of
11:36
ping-ponging around between lots of
11:38
different things and before you know it
11:40
at the end of three months you've been
11:42
really busy but you've really
11:44
accomplished almost nothing and part of
11:47
that comes from having this vague goal
11:50
I'm gonna publish a book by the end of
The Solution
11:52
the year so what's the solution the
11:55
solution is to get super clear on
11:57
exactly what it is you're trying to
11:59
accomplish in this period of time this
12:01
is why I love to plan for 90 days
12:03
because if I start even now and say I'm
12:06
going to plan everything I'm going to do
12:07
for the rest of this year I can get too
12:10
distracted because the projects get too
12:12
big and I followed this Rabbit Hole of
12:15
maybe I should do this but maybe I
12:16
should do this and it becomes very
12:18
difficult to manage six full months but
12:20
90 days is just long enough to focus on
12:23
a project and act actually see momentum
12:26
see results see if it's working or not
12:28
but it's not so long that we allow
12:30
ourselves to get too distracted or so
12:33
long that we get so off course that we
12:35
can't correct so 90 days for me has been
12:37
perfect and what I love to do to get rid
12:40
of this distraction cycle is to get
12:43
really clear on the exact outcome so
12:46
instead of saying I want to publish a
12:47
book by the end of the year what I might
12:49
say is two separate goals I would say I
12:52
want to finish writing 40 000 words by
12:54
the end of this quarter in my second
12:57
part of my goal is I want to get my
12:59
brand and my website completed by the
13:01
end of this quarter then I'm really
13:03
focused on which pieces of that publish
13:06
my book puzzle I'm going to do in the
13:08
next 90 days and I take into
13:10
consideration that first step which is
13:12
how much time do I really have what
13:14
habits do I actually have and once you
13:16
combine those things you start to get
13:18
really clear on exactly what it is you
13:20
want to do and when you set those goals
13:23
like I'm gonna write 40 000 words of
13:25
this book by the end of the quarter then
13:27
you can break that down into micro
13:29
actions like I'm going to write a
13:31
thousand words today or when it comes to
13:35
your website you have it broken down
13:37
into not just I'm gonna complete a
13:39
website but step one research which
13:43
website platform step two make a
13:46
decision and sign up for an account step
13:48
three and you create a list of micro
13:50
actions that you're going to take to get
13:53
you to that final result of my website
13:55
is completed and part of what that does
13:57
for our brains for many of us is that
14:00
Clarity of a single micro action that we
14:03
can complete in a single day or a single
14:05
hour gives us focus on exactly what we
14:09
need to do when we sit down when we sit
14:11
down and there's a potential for 50 000
14:14
different things that we could be doing
14:15
it becomes really easy to say this is
14:19
too big I'm just gonna distract myself
14:20
but when we sit down and we say I'm
14:23
gonna decide today Wix Squarespace or
14:27
WordPress then we have a very detailed
14:31
focus on exactly what we're going to
14:32
accomplish and that leads me into step
14:34
number three which is positive momentum
14:36
so I'm going to talk about that in just
14:37
a second
Self-Assessment
14:38
Clarity equals focus and I do know that
14:42
we have a lot of people here who have
14:44
ADHD or who because of social media and
14:50
all the things that have been going on
14:51
you have symptoms of ADHD and it makes
14:54
it difficult to focus this is why
14:57
self-exploration getting to know
14:59
yourself your own patterns can be super
15:01
super powerful because you can take my
15:04
advice and then you can take your
15:06
knowledge of how you work how your brain
15:08
works how you best Focus yourself and
15:11
then you can arrange your day and your
15:14
tasks like that so for me one of the
15:16
biggest things that I did to create
15:18
focus in my life was to create a kanban
15:21
board where I had those little micro
15:23
actions written down on sticky notes
15:25
where it wasn't out of sight out of mind
15:27
in some planner it was literally up on
15:29
my wall and all I had to do was pick out
15:32
a sticky note and say this is the thing
15:34
I'm going to get accomplished right now
15:36
and that has been a focus tool for me
15:38
but there might be other things that
15:39
work for you so it could be body
15:42
doubling it could be setting a timer for
15:44
yourself it could be as simple as
15:46
figuring out what's the most exciting
15:48
way for me to really get you know hyped
15:52
up and focused and excited to complete
15:54
this task what can I do to gamify it so
15:57
that I can give myself Rewards or give
15:59
myself points there are lots of options
16:02
as to how you can bring in Focus but
16:04
when we have this huge focus of I'm
16:07
gonna publish a book it lacks Clarity
16:11
and it makes it so much easier for us to
16:14
get distracted so the solution get
16:16
really clear on the outcome that you're
16:18
trying to achieve finish the website get
16:21
this many followers start my Tick Tock
16:23
whatever it is create that project and
16:26
then break it down into micro actions or
16:28
tasks that you can complete in a single
16:30
session and see if that type of clarity
16:33
that level of clarity helps you focus
16:35
and follow through reason number three
Negative Momentum
16:37
you're not following through I told you
16:39
we would come back around to this is
16:41
that you've been building negative
16:44
momentum that you're in a cycle of
16:46
negative momentum and what I mean by
16:48
this is that you haven't followed
16:51
through on so many of the tasks like
16:53
this big impossible plan for yourself
16:55
you've been busy but you're not seeing
16:58
the results and so when you look at your
17:00
goals and you start to think about all
17:02
the work you've done and you feel like
17:04
you haven't really made any progress it
17:07
can start to feel really heavy like this
17:09
isn't going to happen for me it's not as
17:11
easy for me it is as it is for other
17:13
people I'm working so hard and I'm not
17:17
seeing the results I want I never follow
17:18
through with my plans I'm just not the
17:20
kind of person you get the idea we can
17:22
start really negative talk to ourselves
17:25
and we can actually begin to look for
17:29
evidence in our world of why we're not
17:31
good enough for our goals of why we're
17:34
too late of why it's never going to
17:35
happen for us of why we just aren't the
17:37
kind of people that can follow through
17:39
with plans or why we're not a good
17:41
enough writer why we're not interesting
17:42
enough for social media there's a
17:44
million things that you might be
17:46
thinking in your head
17:47
and tell me like really take a moment as
17:50
you're watching this and be thinking do
17:52
you have a constant negative
17:54
conversation going on in your head about
17:57
what you're capable of and what you're
18:00
going to accomplish in your life
18:02
sometimes we can get ourselves hyped up
18:04
especially when we're creating that plan
18:06
right we can get really excited for the
18:08
plan but then when we start to follow
18:10
through and we're just not doing it
18:13
we're not doing the work we're not
18:15
showing up we're getting too distracted
18:16
we're seeing evidence everywhere that
18:18
we're not good enough we start to spiral
18:21
into negative headspace
18:24
and I will tell you because I tracked
18:27
this very religiously for myself for a
18:29
little over a year that when I am in a
18:31
negative headspace where Everything
18:33
feels overwhelming where I feel like I'm
18:35
not good enough where I'm saying
18:36
negative things to myself in my head or
18:38
I feel negative I feel like I'm
18:40
comparing myself to other people I am
18:42
maybe 1 8 as productive as when I'm
18:45
feeling joyful and excited about the
18:47
work that I'm doing
18:49
and there's an absolutely a correlation
18:51
for so many of us between how we feel
18:54
and how we produce and so often we tie
18:59
our self-worth to how much we're getting
19:01
done and so we put more on our plate
19:05
than we can handle and we basically make
19:08
an impossible plan like I was talking
19:09
about in Step One
19:11
we don't have Clarity so we get easily
19:14
distracted like I was talking about in
19:15
step two and all of that what we
19:18
sometimes perceive as failing to follow
19:21
through leads to this negative spiral of
19:24
I don't believe that I'm capable of this
19:26
I don't know that I can accomplish this
19:28
and it really takes away our excitement
19:31
and motivation to continue to follow
19:33
through
19:34
so what's the solution what do we do
The Solution
19:37
about it so one thing is to zoom out
19:40
until you can find evidence of your wins
19:46
so what this might mean is that maybe
19:48
over the last week you've had a few hard
19:50
days but if you zoom out and you really
19:52
start to reflect on how far you've come
19:54
in the last month maybe you can see a
19:57
little bit of progress there if not if
19:59
it still feels like wow I've just had a
20:00
really bad month or even 2023 has been a
20:03
really hard year then Zoom farther out
20:05
what I've what about the last two years
20:07
have you finished a book have you
20:09
actually like written your first rough
20:11
draft if you can't find evidence in the
20:13
last couple of years Zoom even further
20:15
out what about 10 years ago where were
20:17
you have you seen progress in your life
20:19
over the last 10 years and sometimes you
20:22
zoom out as far as you need to until you
20:24
find some evidence of wins in your life
20:27
what were times when you actually
20:28
followed through with something and it
20:30
felt really good when you were really
20:31
proud of yourself what are you know
20:34
sometimes when we're just looking at the
20:36
last little bit we don't give ourselves
20:39
credit because we didn't follow through
20:40
on this big impossible plan we think
20:43
that we're not really getting anywhere
20:45
but when we zoom out when we look at the
20:47
last year we realized oh my gosh I
20:49
actually gained a thousand followers on
20:51
Instagram or I actually completed that
20:52
project and sometimes we're just not
20:54
giving ourselves credit for those
20:56
Milestones so one of the first things
20:58
for your mindset that you can do is to
20:59
zoom out until you begin to see the wins
21:04
and then I want you to start collecting
21:06
the wins so either it becomes a weekly
21:09
review process or whether it becomes a
21:12
file on your computer where you're
21:14
taking screenshots of that first review
21:16
or it just becomes a gratitude Journal
21:18
that you keep start collecting your wins
21:22
start looking for evidence of all the
21:24
ways that you are winning in life you've
21:26
made a difference for this person you've
21:28
made a difference in your own life
21:29
you've followed through with this you
21:31
got your room clean you made a step and
21:33
it could be really really small things I
21:35
made my bed today I got out of bed and I
21:38
wrote 500 words today
21:40
any tiny wins start writing them down
21:43
and understand that all progress is a
21:47
win so this is another small but
21:49
effective mindset shift is that
21:52
sometimes we think if I set a goal to
21:54
publish a book by the end of the year
21:56
and I didn't actually publish it and
21:58
start my whole career by the end of the
22:00
year I'm a failure but the truth is
22:02
there are lots of wins that you did
22:04
achieve within that goal you just didn't
22:07
achieve the final outcome and sometimes
22:09
we place way too much importance on that
22:11
Final Destination it's like okay so you
22:14
didn't get the book published by the end
22:15
of the year but you'll get it published
22:16
by next year but what you did do was you
22:19
made significant progress on your
22:20
website you made a decision about your
22:22
pending you did this course called
22:24
publish and Thrive and it started to
22:25
catapult you into this other level of
22:28
understanding how to Market your books
22:29
and get your LLC started and so
22:31
sometimes we just look at that end goal
22:33
and say well I didn't hit 10 000
22:35
subscribers so it was a failure but
22:37
maybe you got a 5 000 subscribers and
22:39
that was double where you were at the
22:40
beginning of the year so finding a way
22:42
to celebrate All progress as a win and
22:46
be just as excited for a little bit of
22:47
progress as a Quantum Leap can do
22:50
wonders for starting to build positive
22:53
momentum because we've heard people talk
22:55
about spiral rolling like I'm spiraling
22:58
right I'm out of control and it's
22:59
usually used in a negative context but I
23:02
promise you that you can also spiral
23:05
your way to Joy you can spiral your way
23:08
to feeling positive and it's as simple
23:11
as looking for those wins celebrating
23:14
all progress as a win and then following
23:17
through with these other two steps that
23:18
I was talking about creating a realistic
23:21
achievable plan that meets you where you
23:23
are breaking that plan down into really
23:26
clear achievable steps that you can get
23:28
done today and then at the end of every
23:31
day saying well I may not have gotten
23:33
all 10 things done that I wanted to but
23:35
I got this one main thing and that is
23:37
progress and that is a win begin to use
23:39
that as a staircase and stack win on top
23:42
of win on top of win a win does not have
23:45
to mean I achieved every single thing it
23:47
just means I made a little bit of
23:49
progress today and whatever that looks
23:50
like for you that's a win
23:53
the more you celebrate it the more you
23:55
start to move forward and the more
23:57
things feel achievable and possible and
23:59
exciting
24:01
and the more you start to follow through
24:03
with your plans so those are my biggest
Final Thoughts
24:06
tips for how to start following through
24:08
with your plan and of course we're all
24:10
different we all have different
24:11
challenges we all have different
24:13
personalities and things that spur us on
24:15
but the more we can create clear steps
24:18
for ourselves believe in ourselves take
24:21
a true realistic look at our time and
24:23
plan for the time we have it's going to
24:25
help all of us and this is one of my
24:28
great passions in life is figuring out
24:30
this puzzle of productivity finding this
24:33
balance of getting it done but also not
24:37
beating myself up when I'm not the most
24:39
productive person learning how to
24:41
celebrate a little bit of progress step
24:43
by step and really enjoy the journey
24:45
that is one of my like true purposes in
24:48
life if this really resonated with you
24:51
and you think gosh I really do want to
24:54
learn to plan this way to learn to
24:55
appreciate the things that I've done
24:57
make an achievable plan and start
24:59
building positive momentum then I hope
25:01
that you you will come and join us in
25:02

general as I'm recording this it is my
0:08
birthday and I love birthdays I love to
0:11
make a whole week or even a month out of
0:12
it and I find that it's the perfect time
0:14
to sort of step back and just feel the
0:17
Gratitude of all the blessings that are
0:20
in our lives and this year I have so
0:22
much to be grateful for including this
0:25
crazy Journey that we've been on over
0:27
the past year getting settled into our
0:29
new home and just all the opportunities
0:31
that have been flowing it's been a
0:33
really great year and you're a part of
0:35
that so thank you for being here thank
0:37
you for being part of this community you
0:39
guys mean the world to me and you know
0:41
part of that gratitude is really also
0:43
looking back to all the changes that
0:46
have happened in my life over the past
0:47
15 even 20 years because it wasn't that
0:51
long ago that I was stuck in a job that
0:54
I did not love really in a life that I
0:56
did not love but I had these Big Dreams
0:58
for who I wanted to be how I wanted to
1:01
show up in the world and a big part of
1:02
those dreams for me was that I really
1:04
wanted to be a writer and I had no idea
1:07
how I was ever going to get my books
1:09
published or get them in the hands of
1:11
readers but I had been passionate about
1:13
stories for most of my life and I wanted
1:16
so badly to learn not only how to write
1:18
the best books that I could write but
1:21
also how to sell those books and that
1:23
led me down this journey of creating my
1:25
own publishing company and Publishing my
1:28
own books and just thinking about how
1:31
far I've come in my journey in my career
1:33
since then and how much that decision to
1:36
self-publish my own books has changed
1:38
not only my life but the lives of
1:40
everyone in my family is just staggering
1:43
and the fact that I now have the
1:46
opportunity to teach some of you how to
1:48
change your own life how to make money
1:50
publishing how to get your books into
1:52
the hands of readers how to change not
1:54
only your lives but the lives you touch
1:56
through your writing and the impact
1:58
you're going to have on the world
1:59
writing is so powerful whether you're
2:01
writing poetry or non-fiction children's
2:03
books fiction we have the power to
2:07
change the world and it's so amazing
2:08
that we live in a time where we can
2:10
publish those books ourselves and really
2:12
take control of our own career so I am
2:15
just super grateful for that my course
2:17
publish and Thrive is currently open for
2:19
enrollment we close enrollment on
2:21
February 4th at noon and then we're
2:23
going to start later that afternoon with
2:25
our kickoff call and module one and I am
2:28
actually heading to Disney World uh
2:31
tomorrow with my best friend Kelly so I
2:33
will not be here uh this week to record
2:35
a new video for you so I thought it
2:37
would be the perfect time to give you a
2:39
little bit of a sneak peek of what's in
2:40
the course and this is going to be a
2:43
video that comes from module one where
2:45
we discuss the importance of
2:46
understanding genre and truly this is at
2:50
the core of all success now it if you
2:54
understand what type of genre you're
2:56
writing that helps you position your
2:58
book in terms of your cover your title
2:59
title all of your metadata all of your
3:02
packaging all of your books product and
3:04
even the elements that go into your book
3:06
so this is a super important topic and
3:08
it'll give you a little bit of a taste
3:09
of what's in the new version of publish
3:12
and Thrive because I first recorded this
3:14
course back in 2019 and then I have
3:17
learned so much over the last few years
3:19
of not only teaching It But continuing
3:21
to publish that I was very excited to
3:24
have the opportunity to completely
3:26
re-record the course with all new
3:28
information with even better
3:30
explanations of the foundational
3:32
material and so alumni you can come back
3:35
through it with us for free anybody who
3:37
hasn't joined before this will give you
3:39
a little bit of an idea and then even if
3:41
you're not interested in the course
3:42
hopefully this video will still be
3:44
really valuable to everyone on my
3:46
channel so let's get started in a
3:48
discussion about the importance of genre
3:55
okay so let's start talking about what
3:58
actually goes into a great book that's
4:01
going to sell that's gonna make you
4:03
money so the first topic that we have to
4:05
address here is genre genre is defined
4:09
as a category of literary composition
4:12
characterized by a particular style form
4:15
or content so genres are typically
4:18
arranged in a hierarchy where you have
4:21
the main umbrella genre and then that's
4:23
broken down into multiple sub-genres and
4:26
sometimes it goes really deep into
4:28
different niches this is basically how
4:31
all bookstores are arranged right you
4:33
walk into a large Barnes Noble and you
4:36
can see the title of the genre like the
4:38
young adult travel self-help and romance
4:42
they will have different sections in the
4:44
bookstore right virtual bookstores which
4:47
is where you will sell most of your
4:48
books as an indie whether directly on
4:50
your website or at Amazon or Google or
4:52
Barnes Noble online
4:54
have unlimited shelf space which means
4:57
that they are able to break down their
4:59
genres into smaller and smaller
5:01
sub-genres or categories and
5:04
understanding how that hierarchy works
5:06
and where you fit into it is essential
5:08
to selling books so for example the
5:11
biggest genre umbrellas are poetry
5:14
fiction non-fiction drama and prose most
5:19
of the people in this course will be
5:21
dealing with probably fiction but we do
5:24
have some people here with non-fiction
5:26
and maybe we have a few poets but those
5:28
are just the huge umbrellas and then
5:30
think about how many different types of
5:33
fiction there are so you've got romance
5:36
mystery science fiction fantasy young
5:39
adult middle grade there's lots of
5:41
genres underneath that umbrella of
5:43
fiction but then if you go to romance
5:46
for example you've got fiction romance
5:49
and then you have a lot of categories
5:51
underneath that or sub genres underneath
5:53
that such as paranormal romance
5:55
contemporary romance science fiction
5:58
romance fantasy romance then if you take
6:01
let's say contemporary romance you can
6:03
Niche that down even more into Mafia
6:06
romance small town romance sweet romance
6:09
erotic romance so there's lots of
6:11
different categories and even underneath
6:13
those you can go down even further so
6:15
when it comes to contemporary romance in
6:17
a small town you might have different
6:19
types of tropes that you would find in
6:21
there like enemies to lovers or second
6:24
chance romance or secret baby there's
6:27
lots of tropes that go under that now
6:29
the way the vendors are arranged when we
6:31
talk about the shelves in a virtual
6:33
vendor like an Amazon or Barnes Noble is
6:36
not exactly niched down in every single
6:40
category as what you can imagine so
6:43
there's not a secret baby small town
6:45
romance category at Amazon or genre at
6:48
Amazon however
6:50
you can help readers find your
6:53
particular sub niche of contemporary
6:55
Romance by the right kind of cover the
6:58
right kind of title and the keywords
7:01
that you use which we'll get into in
7:03
next week's module so how do we
7:05
categorize all of these different genres
7:08
and subgenres well they're categorized
7:10
by things like setting characters plot
7:15
mood tone and theme
7:19
these are just some of the ways that
7:21
readers and vendors and movies and TVs
7:25
and all kinds of places will
7:27
sub-categorize So based on setting or
7:30
the time in which this is set is it set
7:33
in Regency is it set in the Victorian
7:35
area is it contemporary it could also be
7:37
the types of characters if you have a
7:39
male and female lead and they're falling
7:41
in love and that's the tone or the plot
7:43
of the book then it's going to be a
7:45
romance so it's all of these factors
7:47
that play together and each of those
7:49
genres and sub-genres have their own
7:51
conventions and expectations and
7:54
expectations is sometimes a difficult
7:57
thing to come to terms with as a writer
8:00
but it is one of the most important
8:01
things that if you can understand this
8:03
now it is going to help your career so
8:05
much because when we start talking about
8:08
writing great books and actually selling
8:11
them part of that equation that is a
8:14
huge percentage of that equation is
8:16
understanding what genre you're writing
8:18
and what elements readers expect to see
8:21
and feel and experience in that book or
8:25
genre think of these expectations or
8:27
conventions like a list of elements that
8:30
readers expect to find when they open
8:32
your book so remember we talked about
8:35
the reader's journey and they're in that
8:36
consideration phase and they're trying
8:38
to make a decision about which book to
8:40
buy well when they're browsing on Google
8:43
Play books or Koba books or Apple Books
8:45
or Amazon or any of these online vendors
8:48
they are looking at a variety of things
8:50
there may be inside a category Or
8:53
subcategory List like maybe they're
8:55
specifically looking at contemporary
8:57
romance books on Amazon and they're
8:59
looking at your cover art they're
9:01
looking at your description if you're
9:03
lucky your tagline they're looking at
9:06
what other books you might have written
9:08
they're looking at what other books
9:09
other people have read that also bought
9:11
lists and recommendations and because of
9:15
those elements
9:17
mainly your cover art and your blurb
9:19
they're feeling like you're making a
9:22
promise to them
9:23
this is the type of book you're going to
9:25
get and the magic comes in when a reader
9:30
is looking for a contemporary romance
9:33
secret baby small town book and your
9:36
book has the perfect cover it's giving
9:38
them the perfect tone that this is going
9:40
to be a sweet like Second Chance kind of
9:43
book and then they read that blurb and
9:45
it says secret baby and it's got all the
9:47
romance feels and they're like this is
9:50
exactly what I've been looking for so in
9:52
that consideration phase they see that
9:54
this is the genre or sub-genre or Niche
9:57
that I really want this is the Trope I
9:59
was looking for this is the information
10:01
I was looking for so if you're talking
10:03
about non-fiction maybe it's like they
10:05
were specifically looking for a book
10:07
that was going to help them overcome
10:09
anxiety in a way that feels really good
10:13
to them that understands that they grew
10:15
up with a narcissistic parent and then
10:16
you've got this cover that feels exactly
10:19
like what they were looking for it looks
10:21
like it has scientific evidence mixed
10:23
with you know therapy and other things
10:25
and then they read that blurb and it
10:26
just makes them feel like this is
10:28
exactly what I was looking for those
10:30
elements that you put on the page make a
10:33
promise to that reader that when you
10:35
purchase this book and you put down your
10:37
money this is what you're gonna feel
10:39
this is what you're going to experiment
10:41
this is what you're gonna feel this is
10:43
what you're going to experience and this
10:45
is the kind of information or the kind
10:47
of you know feeling that you're gonna
10:48
get from this book or novel
10:53
so if a reader purchases your book we
10:57
talked about that decision phase and
10:59
then they get into that consumption
11:01
phase and that book delivers it's the
11:03
secret baby of their dreams it has all
11:05
those elements that they were looking
11:07
for in that Niche and that is usually
11:09
based on the fact that they've read 50
11:12
other secret baby romances and that's
11:14
why they love them so much or they've
11:16
read 50 other sci-fi Alien Invasion
11:19
books and that's the type of thing they
11:21
love and they love to see that type of
11:22
hero and the you know aliens and they
11:25
want to visually experience this world
11:28
where there's aliens landed on Earth
11:30
they already are coming into it with a
11:33
set of expectations based on books
11:35
movies and things they've consumed
11:37
before in that genre or sub-genre so if
11:41
your book is not like that at all the
11:43
aliens Never Land there's never any of
11:45
that same conflict that they expected or
11:48
it's you know we're back to the secret
11:50
baby romance and it's like well she ends
11:52
up falling in love with with the guy
11:53
that's not the dad of the baby like what
11:55
is happening here you know however that
11:57
may work there are certain elements
12:00
based on things that readers have read
12:01
before that they're hoping for now they
12:04
want to see it in your way they want to
12:07
see it in your voice in your style with
12:09
your brand of humor or your brand of
12:10
emotion they want it to be different but
12:13
the same they want to see those elements
12:16
they love in a new way they want to
12:18
experience that story again or that kind
12:21
of story again for the first time or
12:23
when we're looking at non-fiction
12:25
there's certain things they expect they
12:27
want action steps or they want emotion
12:30
they want to feel seen and so they have
12:32
these expectations of what your book is
12:34
going to deliver on if they get into the
12:37
consumption phase no matter which genre
12:39
we're talking about
12:41
and they don't feel that you delivered
12:43
they don't they didn't get the feeling
12:45
they want they didn't get that fun meat
12:47
cute scene they didn't really you know
12:49
get to experience these people falling
12:51
in love or they didn't really care about
12:52
these characters
12:54
they're not going to want to buy the
12:55
next book in the series
12:56
and this is really where the magic of
13:00
selling books comes in
13:02
is understanding what you're writing in
13:06
terms of what genre and what sub-genre
13:08
and the sub-genre and the category and
13:09
the niche behind that and having such a
13:12
clear understanding of what are the
13:14
elements that people expect when they
13:16
pick up this type of book and then
13:18
delivering on that in your own unique
13:20
way twisting it when you want to like oh
13:23
this is the expectation but she did
13:25
something different here and I really
13:26
liked that and that was fun and exciting
13:28
you could put your own twist on it you
13:30
don't have to copy someone else you
13:31
don't have to boringly like you know
13:34
follow some kind of formula but you just
13:36
need to understand these are the types
13:37
of things readers like to see in these
13:40
kinds of books and if you can deliver on
13:41
that in your own way then they're going
13:43
to want to read every other book you've
13:45
ever published and they're going to want
13:46
to tell all their friends about it and
13:48
that's how you start to sell books this
13:50
is how important understanding your
13:52
genre is a lot of times I will hear new
13:56
writers say well it's not really like
13:59
anything that's ever been done before
14:01
and they'll start telling me about how
14:03
well it starts out as a mystery but then
14:06
Midway through the book he meets the
14:08
love of his life and then it becomes
14:09
more of a romance but then by the end
14:11
his new girlfriend is dead and now
14:14
there's aliens that come down and it's
14:16
never been done before this genre mashup
14:18
or whatever and I'm just gonna tell you
14:20
that you know I'm never the one to want
14:23
to tell people not to write what they
14:25
love but if you have such a
14:29
misunderstanding of what genre is and
14:32
why readers consume books that you put
14:35
something so wild on the page it's just
14:38
very very unlikely that you're ever
14:40
gonna sell that book to great success
14:42
unless maybe it was meant to be kind of
14:44
like a satire or a comedy of some kind
14:47
there are
14:49
Market conventions genre conventions and
14:52
no matter how much of a rebel you may be
14:55
it is important to understand that if
14:57
you want to sell books and you can
15:00
always do things in your own unique way
15:02
but it is so important to understand
15:04
what those elements are and be able to
15:06
take your book and your story and place
15:09
it into some kind of appropriate genre
15:12
so that you can say this is a secret
15:15
baby contemporary small town romance
15:17
this is a young adult contemporary
15:20
fantasy with a portal fantasy inside of
15:23
it this is a science fiction Alien
15:26
Invasion heroic adventure story and if
15:29
you can't describe your book in terms of
15:31
what genre or Niche or sub-genre it fits
15:34
into you will most likely struggle to
15:36
sell your book romances for example have
15:39
a happily ever after Mysteries have some
15:42
kind of usually murder or other mystery
15:44
that needs to be solved and specifically
15:46
psychological Mysteries and thrillers
15:48
will have their own set of elements
15:50
separate from detective Mysteries or
15:53
police procedurals cozy Mysteries will
15:55
have their own set of elements and so
15:57
it's important to kind of understand the
15:59
distinctions between those different
16:01
genres and I'm going to show you a
16:02
little bit about how to do that now it's
16:05
also important to understand that many
16:07
books are going to have multiple aspects
16:10
of these genres now you may have a young
16:12
adult contemporary fantasy like my
16:13
Shadow Demon Saga that also has elements
16:16
of mystery like the actual plot
16:18
structure of it is Mystery there's also
16:20
a strong romance in this series that
16:22
lasts throughout so you've got elements
16:25
of those things you may have a mystery
16:27
that has a romantic will they or won't
16:30
they kind of element in it for multiple
16:32
books that stretches out you may also
16:34
have an Epic Fantasy that has elements
16:36
of all of these different genres maybe
16:38
it's got humor maybe it has some romance
16:40
in it maybe it has mystery and action
16:42
adventure maybe it also has paranormal
16:44
elements or you know witchy elements to
16:47
it so it's going to have all of those
16:48
things but it's important to identify
16:50
what is the umbrella genre like what is
16:53
the main genre of this book because if
16:56
you can identify that then you can start
16:58
to figure out where it goes on those
17:00
virtual shelves and that's how breeders
17:02
will find you because if yours is an
17:04
Epic Fantasy that has all those
17:06
different elements you wouldn't put it
17:08
in contemporary romance or just a
17:10
romance category you would maybe put it
17:12
in fantasy romance and you would put it
17:15
inside the regular like Epic Fantasy or
17:18
high fantasy category so when you get a
17:20
choice and we'll talk about this in
17:22
module two
17:23
most vendors give you more than one
17:25
choice now apple is an exception you get
17:27
one category there and that's it but
17:30
most vendors will give you multiple
17:32
categories so you can put your romance
17:35
book in multiple places you can put your
17:38
non-fiction book in self-help and
17:40
Psychiatry and divorce so you can fit it
17:43
in multiple places where it's
17:44
appropriate however it's very important
17:47
to understand if I only had one choice
17:49
or one way to describe this in terms of
17:51
its genre or sub-genre where would it
17:53
belong and knowing exactly where that is
17:56
is super important so let me give you a
17:58
good example of what I mean by these
18:00
types of elements so let's just zero in
18:03
on contemporary romance what we would
18:05
call a romantic comedy or a rom-com here
18:07
are some elements that I would expect to
18:09
see after watching a bunch of romantic
18:12
comedies on TV and reading a lot of
18:15
romantic comedy novels now every novel
18:17
may not have each of these but it should
18:20
have a few of these elements because
18:22
these are things that readers look
18:23
forward to and especially if you can put
18:25
your own spin on it so here are some
18:27
elements for example of a romantic
18:29
comedy
18:31
a lot of times there are two lovable
18:33
main characters there's a meat cute
18:36
where there's something fun that they
18:38
meet for the first time
18:40
there's often a goofy best friend an ex
18:44
who complicates things there's the
18:46
breakup there's the light bulb moment
18:48
where they realize they should have been
18:50
together this whole time there's the
18:52
grand gesture where they apologize and
18:55
make up there's the happily ever after
18:57
and of course because it's a romantic
18:59
comedy there should be humor there's
19:01
funny situations that these characters
19:02
get them into there's funny dialogue and
19:04
banter between them and a lot of times
19:06
in a romantic comedy it's that banter
19:09
either between the protagonist and her
19:12
best friend or the protagonist or hero
19:15
and heroine who are bantering between
19:17
each other and bickering because they're
19:19
in some kind of funny situation that's
19:21
part of the fun of the experience if a
19:23
reader is going to pick up a romantic
19:25
comedy and they get none of these
19:27
elements that I just listed they're
19:29
going to be very disappointed and so one
19:31
of the things that you can do for
19:32
yourself as an action step is to first
19:35
of all establish what am I writing is
19:39
this a science fiction an alien invasion
19:41
is this a hard-boiled mystery what type
19:43
of romance is this what type of Niche is
19:45
it if you can't identify it come into
19:48
the Facebook group and let us know what
19:50
you're writing and maybe we can help you
19:52
if it's just impossible to identify
19:55
because it's like starts out this way
19:57
and it turns into this and it turns into
19:58
that you've got some serious problems
20:00
with your book and you need to start
20:01
focusing in on what exactly this is in
20:05
my experience the writers who are more
20:08
specific and know exactly which genre
20:10
and Niche they're writing in are the
20:12
most successful writers in this business
20:14
so how do you figure out what these
20:18
elements are
20:20
first of all I have given you a list
20:23
there's just a blog post that's really
20:25
great that has like 144 different
20:27
categories of genre and niches or
20:31
sub-genres that is a really good place
20:33
to start and in there they do give you
20:34
some examples of types of books that are
20:36
in each of these genres or subgenres so
20:38
that can be a good basic explanation I
20:41
have linked that in the description
20:42
above this video
20:44
other things that you can do Google
20:47
Search so let's say you know that you're
20:49
writing a young adult portal fantasy so
20:51
you could search what are the elements
20:52
of a young adult portal fantasy and
20:55
start reading some blogs or Goodreads
20:57
posts or other places that have already
20:59
listed out some of these potential
21:02
elements Google can be your friend in
21:04
this industry trust me you can also go
21:07
on to each of the vendors and you can
21:09
start keyword searching so just search
21:11
for young adult portal fantasy and see
21:13
what comes up at Google Play see what
21:15
comes up on Amazon and then start to
21:18
read these books and see what are the
21:20
common elements oh look there's another
21:22
scene where the protagonist does this oh
21:25
look in this Zombie thing like zombie
21:28
fiction it often happens where there's a
21:30
moment where one of the characters gets
21:32
secretly bitten but they don't tell the
21:33
rest of the crew and then of course
21:35
there's going to be a scene later on
21:36
where they turn into a zombie when
21:38
they're all stuck in some room and they
21:40
have to kill their friend like these are
21:42
tropes these are things that happen like
21:44
Universal all elements in these genres
21:46
and so the more you read this genre the
21:49
more you'll start to identify so take
21:51
your author's eye your analytical eye
21:54
and start reading as many books in your
21:57
chosen subgenre as you can and start
21:59
making lists of what are the common
22:00
elements okay A lot of times for example
22:03
if you look at young adult paranormal
22:05
books like mine young adult contemporary
22:07
fantasy you have missing parents parents
22:10
that have died or you're an orphan and
22:13
now you've discovered that you have some
22:15
kind of secret magical ability so this
22:18
happens over and over again where it's
22:20
either single parent or missing parent
22:22
or drunk parent or absentee parents in
22:24
some way and the young teen discovers
22:27
they have magical powers and belong to
22:29
some other type of Heritage these are
22:31
tropes elements that are common and
22:34
conventions so the more you start to
22:35
read in your chosen subgenre the more
22:38
you'll start to identify those elements
22:40
you can also if you want to take the
22:42
faster route you can use TV and movies
22:44
for the this as well because a lot of
22:45
times they're based on books or they're
22:47
the same genre so you can tell from
22:49
those TV and movies what elements people
22:51
expect from those types of books or
22:53
stories you can also ask your peers so
22:56
joining writers groups coming into our
22:58
publish and Thrive Facebook group and
22:59
saying okay this is the type of book I'm
23:01
writing what do you guys think are the
23:02
elements and start those conversations
23:04
so you start to understand you can also
23:06
ask readers or start to look at reviews
23:07
so if you wanted to see what's all the
23:10
fuss about Colleen Hoover for example
23:12
who's like one of the most popular
23:13
authors of all time you could go into
23:15
the reviews of her books and start
23:17
reading what is it that people love so
23:20
much about this oh my gosh it made me
23:21
cry this tore my heart out I loved these
23:23
characters I couldn't guess what was
23:25
going to happen I never saw that ending
23:26
coming and you can start to see those
23:28
elements of why people love Colleen
23:30
Hoover books and the same would be true
23:32
for any author that you went out there
23:34
to start researching you could find out
23:36
a lot from their reviews so these are
23:38
some of the ways that you start to do
23:40
market research to understand genre if I
23:42
could drive home to you just how
23:43
important it is to write in a clear and
23:46
established genre now like I said before
23:49
I never want to tell people don't write
23:51
what you love I want you to write what
23:53
you love but like we'll talk about in
23:55
the next video your sweet spot is going
23:57
to be figuring out how to write the
23:59
stories that you love in a way that
24:01
resonates with readers and that they
24:03
understand in terms of genre
24:05
expectations so if you have any
24:07
questions put them down below and I will
24:09
address them in our live q a but genre
24:12
is so important and like I said you may
24:15
find that your book fits into multiple
24:18
sub-genres overall because it has some
24:21
of the elements of things but there
24:22
should be one Central description one
24:25
Central genre that you are going to aim
24:29
for when it comes to your cover art and
24:30
your book packaging and this is
24:32
extremely important because if a reader
24:33
finally lands on your sales page and
24:36
they don't really understand what your
24:38
book is promising what kind of book is
24:39
this you're going to have trouble
24:41
getting that sale and that's we're going
24:42
to talk about next is writing books that
24:45
actually okay guys I hope you enjoyed

[Music]
hey guys welcome back to heart
0:01
breathing's today I am so excited to not
0:04
only share with you that I have just
0:06
recently celebrated eight full years as
0:09
a self-published indie author but also
0:12
my top eight tips for things that I have
0:15
learned for how to be a joyful indie
0:17
author how to navigate this very
0:19
difficult and emotionally challenging
0:23
career and come out on top not only
0:26
successfully as a self publisher but
0:29
also successfully as a human being who
0:31
is an artist and wants to make a living
0:33
doing something that you love so rather
0:35
than put all eight tips in one video
0:38
because I tend to talk a lot and I have
0:40
a lot that I want to share that I'm very
0:42
passionate about and making this like an
0:44
hour-long video I have decided to break
0:46
this into eight separate videos that
0:48
hopefully will come off a little bit
0:49
shorter so today we're going to be
0:51
talking about my first tip which is that
0:54
comparison kills your joy
0:56
[Music]
0:59
so I'm so glad that you're here today
Why Comparison Kills Your Joy
1:02
we're going to talk about one of the
1:04
number one things I have learned over
1:05
the last eight years and this applies to
1:07
you in every facet of your life not just
1:10
your indie publishing but the truth is
1:13
that comparison is truly the thief of
1:15
joy comparison can kill your joy for
1:19
writing your joy for creating your joy
1:21
for every little milestone that you hit
1:24
in your life and this is something that
1:26
I struggled with quite a bit in the
1:28
early days of my indie career and I have
1:30
really had to work on over the past
1:33
several years now I know that many of
1:35
you are hoping that oh gosh you know I
1:37
want to know how she sold over half a
1:39
million books and I want all the
1:41
marketing tips and I know that a lot of
1:43
you have asked me to share more
1:44
marketing tips on this channel and I do
1:45
have some things coming up for you but
1:48
one of the main reasons that I choose to
1:50
focus on the more emotional side and the
1:53
more organizational side of being an
1:55
indie author is that this is extremely
1:59
important when you are running your own
2:02
business as a creative entrepreneur like
2:05
you know there's lots of types of
2:07
entrepreneurs out there and what they do
2:09
is they write blog posts or they follow
2:10
a series of checklists and you know they
2:13
take courses and they learn how to do
2:14
stuff but when you're a creative
2:16
entrepreneur and you're writing fiction
2:17
and you're writing your own books you
2:20
put more of yourself into that creative
2:23
process and it's not something that you
2:24
can create in a week or create in a
2:26
weekend this is something that
2:27
potentially takes you months if not
2:29
years of your life to create and so it
2:31
is a more emotionally challenging type
2:34
of career to be an indie author and so
2:37
it is so so important to make sure that
2:40
your mindset is in the right place so
2:42
that you can continue to create I cannot
2:44
stress the importance of this enough and
2:45
maybe that should be a tip all on its
2:47
own but that is why so many of the tips
2:50
that you're going to hear from me are
2:51
more about navigating the emotional and
2:53
the mindset challenges of being an indie
2:55
author but there will be a few tips in
2:57
here also about the marketing side of
2:59
things and if you are looking for some
3:01
of my better marketing advice you might
3:02
want to watch my series on how to write
3:05
a best-selling series because writing
3:06
series with a loss leader and good
3:08
branding and I talk about all these
3:09
kinds of things enough
3:10
Cirie's is one of the best strategies
3:13
that still works to this day and helped
3:15
to launch my career and so you might
3:18
want to go back and watch that but in
3:19
this video series over the next few days
3:21
I'm going to be sharing with you some of
3:24
the more emotional tips and mindset tips
3:26
that I hope will help you to navigate
3:27
the more emotionally challenging waters
3:31
of the self-publishing career alright so
The Problem With Comparison
3:33
with that being said let's talk about
3:34
comparison like I said this is something
3:36
that I really really struggled with
3:38
early on because I think that it's just
3:41
natural in this type of digital career
3:44
where the numbers are out there you can
3:47
see very clearly how someone is ranking
3:49
you can see very clearly how many
3:51
followers they have you know we attached
3:53
these numbers to things all the time in
3:55
our culture right now where we've got
3:57
social media and digital you know
3:59
publishing and things like that so it's
4:01
very easy to see on the surface like
4:03
this person has 20,000 followers and
4:06
they're ranked 500 in the Kindle Store
4:07
and blahdy blahdy blah and then you look
4:10
at that and you can easily judge
4:12
yourself based on that well I only have
4:14
five thousand subscribers and they've
4:15
got twenty thousand that must mean that
4:17
I am no longer as good as they are and
4:20
this is just such a huge problem
4:22
emotionally for us because once you
4:25
start to compare yourself to other
4:27
people with they're not biet their
4:28
numbers be it how fast they write or you
4:31
know how many compliments or comments
4:33
they get on their Facebook page or you
4:35
know even there are certain Facebook
4:37
groups out there where people love to
4:39
share screenshots of how much money they
4:40
made every month but the truth is a lot
4:43
of what you see first of all is smoke
4:45
and mirrors especially when people talk
4:47
about their income there are some of us
4:49
out there who are very transparent with
4:52
our income or our sales used to share my
4:54
sales numbers monthly on my blog and I
4:56
stopped doing that years ago but there
4:58
are some of us who are transparent about
5:00
it and then there are other people who
5:02
will come out and say oh my very first
5:03
month I made $15,000 and I'm amazing and
5:06
they share screenshots and they tell
5:07
everybody what amazing job they did but
5:10
what you don't see is on the backside of
5:12
it you don't see that they spent nearly
5:14
fifteen thousand dollars to promote
5:15
their book and they got every friend
5:18
they know to share and to buy the book
5:19
and you know some of these things are
5:21
things that you can't do long-term it's
5:23
just I spend
5:24
all this money to launch that I can have
5:26
this great screenshot of my income and I
Comparing Yourself To Others
5:28
know it sounds ridiculous that people
5:29
would do that but it is true that they
5:31
do so you can't always compare yourself
5:33
to what someone else says their numbers
5:36
are and of course some numbers are just
5:38
transparent as they are like somebody
5:40
has 20,000 followers on their Facebook
5:42
or likes on their Facebook page you may
5:44
not have that but how does that mean
5:46
that you are not as good as them a lot
5:48
of times that person probably has you
5:51
know five years into that career and
5:54
you've just gotten started so why would
5:56
you compare yourself where you are on
5:58
your journey to that person who's
6:00
obviously been doing this longer or have
6:02
more time to build up that following
6:04
what you need to remember is that you
6:07
are on your own individual journey
6:09
this isn't about someone else's journey
6:11
and no one is sitting here going well
6:13
you know Sarah Canon has this and you
6:16
have this nobody is sitting there
6:18
judging you based on your numbers and
6:21
saying you know you're not good enough
6:22
because you don't have as many Facebook
6:24
followers as XYZ and if someone is doing
6:27
that that's someone that you don't need
6:28
to be associating with because they
6:30
don't have your best interests at heart
6:31
we have to try as creatives to step away
6:36
from all the numbers that are out there
6:38
that allow us to so easily compare
6:41
ourselves with other people and yes
6:43
there are going to be times when you
6:45
know it gets really hard like maybe
6:47
you've worked your butt off and you've
6:48
come up with this series and you've
6:50
spent six months prewriting and
6:52
launching and you've spent money and you
6:54
know you've done all this stuff and it
6:55
just doesn't launch the way that you
6:56
wanted it to and then you're gonna look
6:58
across the aisle there on your Kindle
7:00
and you're gonna see that somebody else
7:02
who's brand-new and never done this
7:04
before and you've been at this for six
7:05
years and they you know knocked it out
7:08
of the park and they've got all this
7:09
sales they've got everybody talking
7:10
about their book all these bloggers are
7:12
covering it you know and they're doing
7:14
better than you when you look at the
7:16
short term numbers and that is gonna
7:18
feel really really bad it happens to all
7:21
of us it happens to New York Times
7:22
bestsellers that this kind of comparison
7:24
becomes a problem and what you have to
7:27
remember when you start to feel that way
7:30
about someone else's career is that that
7:32
that's their journey and there's a
7:34
unique set of circumstances that has
7:36
gotten them to that level
7:37
and you also have to remember that that
7:39
is one snapshot in time that is your
7:42
journey versus that person's journey
7:43
right now and some of it is true some of
7:47
it isn't even true some of it's just
7:48
stuff that your mind tells you oh
7:50
they're better than me they're doing
7:51
better they're making more money or
7:53
whatever and the truth may not be that
7:55
they're making more money it may be that
7:56
they spent more money or it may be that
7:58
they're ranking better than you for this
8:01
exact moment in time but over the course
8:03
of the month they haven't sold as many
8:05
books as you our ego sometimes likes to
Comparison
8:07
lie to us in order to push us down and I
8:10
hate that about our ego but especially
8:13
as creatives we do get kind of get
8:15
caught up in our heads with these lies
8:17
like we're not as good or you know I
8:20
wish that I could be more like them now
8:22
I do understand that for some people
8:23
comparison can be a good thing you might
8:26
compare yourself like you might look up
8:28
to someone else and say you know I want
8:30
their career how did they do that and
8:32
you might be able to look at what they
8:33
did pull some strategies out of what you
8:36
know pushed them up to the top and use
8:39
that as inspiration or use it as
8:41
something you want to try in your own
8:42
career well that's great if it inspires
8:44
you and it feels good use that but the
8:47
kind of comparison I'm talking about is
8:49
when you look at how someone else is
8:51
doing and it makes you feel like you are
8:54
less of a person or that you are not as
8:56
talented that kind of comparison does
8:59
you absolutely know good because it is
9:01
lies it is lies something in you is
9:05
afraid to succeed something in you is
9:08
afraid that you're not good enough and
9:10
so it's lying to you to try to protect
9:12
you it's saying you look at this here's
9:14
proof that you are not good enough and
9:16
if you go around in your life looking
9:18
for proof that you're not good enough
9:19
and that someone's better than you
9:21
you're always going to find that and
9:22
what good does that do you to compare
9:25
yourself just to get proof that you're
9:27
not good enough and it fills you with
9:30
negative feelings it makes you feel like
9:33
you don't deserve to be where you are
9:35
and it's just not a great jumping-off
9:37
point to be extremely creative and to
Dont Compare
9:39
create an entire world out of your brain
9:41
so I don't recommend comparing yourself
9:43
to other people what I want you to
9:45
remember is this you always have a
9:47
choice of whether you want to focus on
9:49
the negative
9:51
here's the things I don't have because
9:53
in truth
9:55
that's what comparison is comparison is
9:57
looking at someone else and saying they
9:59
have this and I want it and I don't have
10:01
it or they have this that I feel like
10:04
they don't deserve it and I do and so
10:07
you're focusing on this lack mentality
10:09
of here's something I want that I don't
10:11
have and they're proving to me that it's
10:14
possible and it just makes me angry
10:16
because or it makes me hurt because or
10:18
it makes me feel like I'm not good
10:20
enough because I don't have it and if
10:23
you choose to focus on the things you
10:25
don't have then you're just going to
10:28
continue to focus on the things you
10:30
don't have you may actually be gaining a
10:33
thousand followers every couple of
10:35
months and selling a few more books and
10:37
moving forward and not even notice it or
10:40
be grateful for it because all you're
10:41
focused on is susie-q romance right over
10:44
here who's doing better than you are
10:46
where is the joy in that where is the
10:48
sense of accomplishment where is the
10:50
motivation in that it just does you
10:52
absolutely no good to continue to
10:54
compare yourself to other people so
10:56
instead of focusing on the things you
10:58
don't have and the things that other
11:00
people have that you wish you had try
11:03
focusing instead on the things that
11:05
you're grateful for the things that
11:06
you're good at the things that you get
11:09
inspired to do or that you get to do I
11:12
mean if I start to compare myself to
11:14
someone else and I say gosh you know
11:16
I've been working so hard for eight
11:17
years and I just can't break this
11:19
ceiling or I just can't you know get
11:21
seem to get this ranking on Amazon or
11:24
I'm not selling as many books as I want
11:26
if I focus on the lack of things or the
11:29
things that I don't have then I don't
11:31
feel motivated to get up and start
11:33
working on the next book I just feel
11:34
tired frankly but if I can shift my
11:38
mindset into this place where I start to
11:41
think oh my gosh I have this amazing job
11:44
I get it talked to characters in my head
11:46
I get to create worlds I get to you know
11:49
explore what it means to be a hero what
11:53
it means to you know to fall on your
11:55
face and get back up what it means to
11:58
confront evil I get to come up with
12:00
these cool spells and fireballs and orbs
Focus On Yourself
12:03
of light and
12:04
you know there's all these things that I
12:05
get to do and I get to be surrounded by
12:07
stationary it's like one of my favorite
12:09
things in the world and I have a job
12:11
where I get to you know actually use
12:13
colorful note cards and it becomes like
12:15
actually useful and functional rather
12:17
than just me playing around with no card
12:19
you know that kind of stuff it gets me
12:21
excited it gets me motivated I get to
12:24
focus on instead of like oh she's got
12:26
twenty thousand people in our newsletter
12:28
and I don't understand why she has that
12:30
and why don't I have that which only
12:31
makes me feel bad
12:33
I can choose instead to focus on things
12:35
like wow look at the 1,200 fans that I
12:38
have over here who are being interactive
12:40
in this Facebook group and look how much
12:43
they're enjoying the book and look how
12:44
much they're becoming a community and
12:46
even if that number was only 200 or 20
12:49
there's 20 people that are reading my
12:51
book that are so excited that they
12:53
wanted to join my group it's not a
12:54
comparison because you have 20 and she
12:57
has 20,000 does not make her better than
13:00
you and that's what you most you need to
13:02
understand the most out of everything in
13:04
this conversation is just because
13:06
someone has a better number than you you
13:09
know somewhere further down the road
13:10
does not make them better because you
13:13
have unique gifts you have unique
13:15
opportunities in your career so focus on
13:18
yourself this is something I talk about
13:21
some in my three day bootcamp course
13:23
where we talk about you know moving
13:25
toward what you want and how to really
13:27
get what you want get toward your vision
13:30
is you know if you're running and you're
13:33
just going straight toward the finish
13:35
line you're going to be going in a
13:37
straight line but if somebody passes you
13:39
and you choose to turn your head and
13:41
watch what they're doing you're going to
13:43
naturally we're into their lane and
13:46
you're gonna be now following their
13:47
finish line not your own this is an
13:49
analogy that comes from Todd Henry's
13:51
book louder than words and it really
13:54
struck home with me because you know the
13:57
more you compare yourself to other
13:58
people and you think about what they're
14:00
doing and you pay attention to
14:02
everything they're doing the more
14:03
instead of following your path toward
14:05
your dreams and your individual unique
14:08
vision for your life you're gonna veer
14:10
into their vision you're going to be
14:12
starting to follow their path and
14:13
hitting their goals and the truth is
14:15
you're always going to be behind them
14:16
you're always going to be several
14:18
behind because they're already on that
14:20
journey and hopefully they're following
14:21
you know the life path that they want to
14:23
follow but unless their life path is
14:26
your life path and your goals and it
14:28
lines exactly with what they're doing
14:30
why the heck are you trying to do what
14:32
they're doing why the heck are you
14:33
comparing your journey with their
14:35
individual unique journey it does you no
14:38
good and I cannot tell you this enough
14:41
comparison is truly the thief of joy
14:44
stop comparing yourself to other people
14:46
if it doesn't motivate you and it
14:48
doesn't make you feel good just stop
14:50
paying attention to it
14:51
focusing on the lack is never gonna
14:53
serve you but focusing on the things
14:55
that you have even if there's only a
14:57
couple of really amazing things like
14:59
this story I have this story that I love
15:02
I have these 20 devoted fans I have this
15:05
great supportive partner who is
15:06
listening to me I have this amazing best
15:08
friend who lets me talk through my
15:10
stories whatever it is I have this
15:12
NaNoWriMo community I have this youtuber
15:14
that I love to watch you know not saying
15:16
it's me but you know just in case focus
15:18
on those things because they bring you
15:19
joy and that make you feel good and the
15:21
things that don't make you feel good the
15:22
things that make you feel like you're
15:24
less than or you're not good enough
15:25
those things can just you can just let
15:28
them go
15:28
because they're truly lies the more you
15:31
can learn to switch that mindset to the
15:33
things that bring you joy the more
15:35
you're going to be joyfully creative and
15:38
the more you're going to be successful
15:39
in actually hitting your own goals and
15:42
moving towards your own dreams all right
15:44
guys so long enough conversation you can
15:47

16:37
[Music]

hey guys welcome back to heart breathing
0:01
we have been discussing over the last
0:04
couple of videos some of my top tips and
0:07
advice for self publishers that I have
0:09
learned and sometimes learned the hard
0:11
way over the course of the last eight
0:13
years and so today we are on to tip
0:16
number three which is think long term so
0:23
this is something another one of those
0:25
kinds of tips that I learned the hard
0:27
way but that is one of the absolute most
0:29
important things that I have learned is
0:31
you know this business moves incredibly
0:35
fast there are people who some you know
0:37
some people you will see will write a
0:39
book every two weeks or be publishing a
0:41
book every two weeks algorithms change
0:43
trends change what works one week
0:46
doesn't work the next week everybody
0:48
will say oh you know everybody's got to
0:50
have a newsletter and then before you
0:52
know it there's like 50,000 people doing
0:55
Kindle giveaways to get people on their
0:57
newsletter and then now no one opens
0:59
newsletters anymore
1:00
so it's kind of one of those businesses
1:02
like I was talking about in our last
1:03
video don't take things for granted it's
Dont take things for granted
1:06
one of those businesses where things are
1:07
changing rapidly so what I find is that
1:11
a lot of people tend to focus then on
1:13
things that work short-term so they
1:16
focus on you know okay right now this is
1:19
the big thing is everybody's trying this
1:21
one thing and if you run this kind of ad
1:23
along with this little hack you can get
1:26
50 extra sales or you know what if you
1:28
gift yourself 50 comp copies on Amazon
1:31
then it'll boost your ranking blah blah
1:34
blah well it's fine
1:36
to try things that work short-term like
1:38
little tactics or little boosts and all
1:40
that kind of stuff like go for it as
1:42
long as it's not breaking Terms of
1:44
Service you're not really getting
1:45
yourself in danger by trying some of
1:47
these little things that work so you
What works today doesnt work tomorrow
1:51
know go for it but one of the worst
1:54
things that you can do for your indie
1:55
career is to focus solely on things that
1:58
work in the short term because what
2:00
you're going to end up doing is like
2:02
basically giving yourself whiplash
2:03
because you're like trying this and then
2:05
that and then this and
2:06
that and then you're gonna have to be
2:08
basically changing your strategy in the
2:11
way you run your career every few weeks
2:12
or months because what works today
2:15
doesn't work tomorrow
2:16
a much more stress-free joyful way to
2:21
run your career is to really focus on
2:23
things that are going to be moving you
2:25
toward your long-term vision for your
2:27
life rather than things that like make a
2:29
quick buck today or things that work now
2:32
that you know are not going to be
2:33
working tomorrow so in the last video I
2:37
touched on like how when KDP select
2:39
first came out there was a thing where
2:41
they would allow you if you were
2:42
exclusive to Amazon to run a few free
2:45
days on your book and this is still
2:46
something that is there but the system
2:49
used to be a little bit different
2:50
because there was no Kindle unlimited
2:51
and what people found is that if you ran
2:54
a free day and you got your book let's
2:56
say 50,000 downloads on your book that
2:59
day then when the book went back to paid
3:02
your ranking would zip way up the chart
3:06
as if you had sold like 50,000 books it
3:09
wasn't quite like one to one like that
3:11
but let's say it would act as if you had
3:13
sold 5,000 books so you could come off
3:15
of a very successful run giving your
3:17
book away for free and hit the top 100
3:20
on Amazon and this was something that
3:22
people you know Indies we as a community
3:24
we're always looking for little things
3:26
that work quickly and you know that was
3:28
a great thing it actually launched
3:30
people's careers when they followed that
3:32
tactic but if you're gonna follow stuff
3:34
like that you have to know that it's
3:36
something short-term like any of us
3:38
could see most of us could see very
3:40
easily that like this is gonna be
3:42
something that works for a few months or
3:44
maybe for a year and then it's going to
3:46
change because things like this just
3:48
always change so that's part of what I
3:50
was talking about in the last video you
3:51
can't take anything for granted
3:53
including tactics or you know any of
3:55
that kind of stuff so what you need to
3:58
be doing in my opinion is really
3:59
thinking long-term because otherwise
4:02
where you get into trouble and this is
4:04
something that I experienced and I've
4:06
talked about on this channel before is
4:08
that if you're just thinking about the
4:10
here and now or just this year or just
4:13
what's going on you know in the past six
4:15
months or whatever you're going to be
4:17
making decisions that might be
4:20
very difficult to get out of - you know
4:23
rearranged to recover from for years to
4:27
come so for example from my own career I
4:31
started out writing one series and that
4:33
served me really well built up my
4:35
readership it built up a lot of loyalty
4:37
it built up a lot of sales and a lot of
4:39
momentum but when that series was done I
4:41
started a new series and then another
4:43
new series and then another new series
4:45
and to the point where you know I didn't
4:49
even realize it because I was really
4:50
just kind of following my passion of
4:52
like oh I really want to write this and
4:53
after six or after six books or two
4:56
years of writing the same series I was
4:58
ready for something new so instead of
5:00
thinking long-term about how am I going
5:03
to get so many books out in so many
5:05
different series at a reasonable rate I
5:08
was just focused on this is what I
5:10
really want to write and then when that
5:11
book was done instead of coming up with
5:13
a long term strategy I was like oh but I
5:16
really want to write this and I really
5:17
want to write this it's very shiny
5:18
object syndrome and I wasn't thinking
5:21
about how that might affect me long term
Multiple Series
5:23
not only switching genres and building
5:27
up different reader bases and how that
5:28
might fracture my brand I didn't think
5:30
about that all I was thinking about was
5:32
who I want to write this I also wasn't
5:34
thinking about how how difficult it
5:36
would be to keep up with multiple series
5:38
especially as someone who typically was
5:42
only writing about two books a year if
5:44
you've got five series going and you can
5:46
only write two books a year that means
5:48
only one book per series every couple of
5:50
years and that's just not the best way
5:52
to run an indie career so I shot myself
5:56
in the foot with that and so when I
5:58
started really understanding how that
6:00
was affecting my income how it was
6:02
affecting my joy and my stress levels
6:04
because every time I would release a new
6:06
book people would say oh well that's
6:08
great but where's this other one we've
6:10
been waiting for two years and so it was
6:11
like even when I had that accomplishment
6:13
finishing a new book there was still
6:15
that guilt and that pressure of like oh
6:17
yeah but now I'm Way behind on this
6:19
other series and I just don't want to be
6:21
in that place anymore so when I started
6:23
2018 this year I decided you know enough
6:28
of this I've got I had five series going
6:30
at the beginning of this year and I just
6:31
decided Oh
6:33
okay I am going to work my butt off for
6:35
the next few years to finish out those
6:37
series so that I can get back to a
6:39
focused long-term strategy but even
6:42
though I wrote and published five books
6:44
and I'm writing my sixth book which
6:46
makes this by far my most productive
6:49
year of all time
6:51
I still have five books to write to get
6:53
out from under the series that I was
6:54
writing now everything I'm writing is
6:56
something that I want to be writing but
6:58
it's just understanding that when you
7:00
start a series you're committing
7:03
potentially two years of writing
7:05
something or at least hundreds of
7:07
thousands of words depending on how long
7:08
it takes you to write that and it's very
7:10
difficult to abandon series without
7:13
upsetting your fans or losing fans and
7:16
it's very difficult emotionally to
7:18
abandon a series that you loved to write
Long Term
7:20
so when you make these decisions when it
7:23
comes to you know what books you're
7:24
going to write what strategies you're
7:26
going to follow what genre you're going
7:29
to write what your branding is gonna be
7:30
I would highly highly highly recommend
7:34
to you that you think about how it's
7:36
going to affect you long-term don't just
7:39
think about how oh this will bring in a
7:41
lot of money right now or this is really
7:43
what I want to write right now and
7:44
that'll be awesome before you start
7:46
publishing stuff and you start down that
7:49
road of like committing to a series or
7:51
committing to a genre or you know
7:53
putting yourself out there as a certain
7:54
type of brand or whatever I really hope
7:57
that you will take a minute to think
7:58
about where you're going where you want
8:01
to go what your long-term vision for
8:03
your life is and whether or not this
8:05
decision moves you further toward that
8:07
now this is something again we talked
8:09
about a lot in my three day bootcamp if
8:11
you guys are interested I will put a
8:13
link down below because that bootcamp
8:15
will be opening up again in December and
8:17
there will be limited slots available
8:19
for that so if you're interested in
8:21
joining the bootcamp on how to set your
8:23
goals for you know 90 days to start off
8:26
the year great in 2019 I will put that
8:29
link and you can join my waiting list
What is your longterm goal
8:31
but we talked about that law in the
8:33
class which is basically you know think
8:35
about what it is you want out of your
8:38
life like what is truly your long-term
8:40
goal because we could build this room
8:43
with I don't know 50 people and every
8:45
single
8:46
person would have a slightly nuanced
8:49
different gold now maybe we would all
8:51
want to write you know if we were all
8:53
writers we might all want to write
8:55
full-time or make money writing but the
8:58
nuance of what we want to write and how
9:00
often we want to work and how many books
9:02
we want to write per year and how we
9:03
want to interact with our fans all that
9:05
stuff is going to be very different it's
9:07
going to be very individual to you some
9:09
people care more less about what they're
9:12
writing and more about the experience of
9:14
you know making money and you know
9:17
having a community or as long as it's
9:19
romance I don't really care what
9:21
sub-genre other writers are going to say
9:23
no it has to be this like if I'm not
9:26
writing Cowboys I'm not going to be
9:28
happy and so it's important to know what
9:31
your thing is what is it you're trying
9:33
to go for in your life what's your
9:35
long-term vision and then every single
9:37
choice you make think of how it's going
9:41
to affect you in the long term don't
9:42
just think well this is going to make me
How does that affect you
9:44
money right now even though it might and
9:47
maybe that would be super exciting but
9:49
think about how does that affect you
9:51
okay yeah I really really want to write
9:53
this new cowboy series but you have to
9:56
think okay if I take the time to write
9:59
this what am I giving up oh yeah I'm
10:01
giving up the time to finish out this
10:03
other series that's doing really well
10:04
and how is that going to affect me
10:06
long-term so instead of just thinking
10:08
about how things affect you right now or
10:10
what you really want right now start
10:13
looking to the future and pulling out a
10:16
calendar and saying okay but how if I
10:19
write this now what does that do to my
10:21
current series and how long does it mean
10:23
that's going to be until that gets
10:24
finished if I start to new series this
10:27
year and then you know I get pregnant
10:29
because we've been trying to have a baby
10:31
then how am I going to finish all three
10:33
of those series or keep up with that
10:35
there's just lots of little things like
10:37
that that you need to really at least
10:38
have in the back of your mind and be
10:40
thinking about long term there are so
Short term vs long term
10:43
many people out there that are focused a
10:46
hundred percent on the short term and
10:48
there are people teaching courses there
10:50
are people in facebook groups there are
10:51
authors here on YouTube that are
10:53
teaching you how to short-term here's
10:56
how you can make money here's how you
10:57
can mark it and
10:59
none of that stuff you know is valuable
11:00
but it's also you have to understand
11:02
that that is like a snapshot in time
11:03
those are things that are going to move
11:05
you a tiny bit forward right now and
11:08
then six months from now the entire
11:09
system is going to change so if you're
11:12
not focused on how your decisions that
11:14
you're making right now affect you in
11:16
the long term you could potentially be
11:18
doing stuff that it's not only going to
11:20
not move you forward towards your dreams
11:22
but it's actually going to be extremely
11:25
detrimental to you so think of it this
11:28
way too like you try a tactic that makes
11:31
your fans angry but hey it made you a
11:33
hell of a lot of money where is that
11:35
getting you in the long term also you
11:37
write a genre that is super super trendy
11:40
and it might make you a lot of money
11:41
right now for the next six months but
11:43
where does that move you toward your
11:45
long-term vision for your life when that
11:48
trend changes are you building up you
11:50
know if you write five books this year
11:51
all in a genre that you don't really
11:53
like how is that moving you toward the
11:56
ideal life of your dreams
11:58
it might make you money in the short
11:59
term but short term is not going to
12:02
bring you joy and it's not going to
12:04
bring you closer to that ideal life and
12:06
hopefully you want to move closer to
12:10
that ideal and sometimes it can be very
12:12
difficult to make those decisions
12:14
because we want the success we want the
12:17
money and sometimes you can make excuses
12:19
like well if I don't make money doing
12:21
this trendy genre that I'm not going to
12:23
be able to publish over here but what
12:25
you're not thinking about is how taking
12:27
those six months to write a genre that
12:29
you don't necessarily like that's trendy
12:31
for a short period of time and it's only
12:33
going to bring in so much money for so
12:35
long is gonna affect your whole career
12:37
your brand your your happiness your joy
12:41
of writing or time away from this other
12:44
series that you were building how much
12:46
are you sacrificing in order to make
12:48
money in the short term and I'm not
Dont be judgmental
12:51
saying this to be judgmental because you
12:53
know we all follow our own paths and
12:55
some people you know love writing to
12:57
trends and that's what you want to do
12:58
and I have nothing against it some
12:59
people love you know following the
13:01
latest marketing strategies and it's
13:03
like a game and it's really fun to them
13:05
and it's an enjoyable part of the
13:07
process but it's not a judgment thing
13:10
it's just an urging you to really
13:13
about what choices if like every single
13:15
choice you make how it's going to affect
13:18
you in the long term rather than just
13:20
saying I have a need to make more money
13:23
so therefore I'm going to jump on these
13:24
five things that someone else told me to
13:27
do without thinking of how that could
13:29
affect my brand or how it could affect
13:31
my joy or how it could affect my other
13:33
series that I'm writing or whatever
13:35
because it can be very difficult and
13:38
very time-consuming to dig yourself out
Five things to do without thinking
13:40
of some of those holes so if I had not
13:43
you know started five different series
13:46
then you know maybe my income would be
13:48
way up this year because I wasn't trying
13:51
to finish things out and having to put
13:53
six months between books and a series if
13:56
I had not started so many different
13:57
series maybe I would be moving on to
14:00
something else already that might have
14:02
been more popular or you know you don't
14:04
really know but what you do know is that
14:07
you know I know that if I had been more
14:10
intentional and I had really looked at a
14:12
calendar and said you know how am I
14:13
going to keep up with all these series I
14:15
never would have started so many because
14:16
I know that part of being a successful
14:19
indie publisher is getting books out in
14:21
a series as quickly as possible and
14:24
writing them to the best of my ability
14:26
and when I've got so many series going
14:28
on even if I wrote five books in a year
14:30
it would only be one book per series per
14:32
year and that's just not the best
14:34
long-term way to build up new fans or to
14:37
build up my income so it's you know it's
14:39
just a situation that I'm in right now
14:42
that I'm digging myself out of that hole
14:44
because I'm not going to abandon these
14:46
series because I love them I just know
14:48
that now I have to really before I make
14:50
a decision about what series comes next
14:52
or what I'm gonna commit to with my fans
14:54
I really have to think about how it's
14:56
gonna affect me long-term and you know
14:58
one of the things that I'm coming across
15:01
you know now that I'm thinking about
15:03
next year and being done with all of
15:06
these series and what comes next is you
15:08
know there's a series that I really
15:09
really want to write and it's young
15:11
adult but it's moving more into
15:12
dystopian and science fiction than it is
15:15
the fantasy and witches that I've
15:17
typically write so even though I really
15:19
really want to write that I have to also
15:21
think how it's going to affect me
15:22
long-term is the
15:24
a leap that I want to make are my fans
15:26
going to follow me is it worth like do I
15:29
want to write it so much so that I just
15:31
have to write it and rebuild for the
15:33
fans that don't follow me to a new genre
15:35
or is it not worth the risk because
15:37
there's another like witches and
15:39
fantasies type thing that I really
15:41
really want to write just as badly and
15:43
these are the types of questions that I
15:44
have to ask myself and I have to look at
15:47
it intentionally against my vision for
15:49
my long-term you know my long-term
15:51
vision for my life this is just some of
15:54
the practical advice that I have for you
15:56
guys is really think about everything
15:57
long-term it can be really easy to
15:59
listen to people that will tell you you
16:02
know here's how you buy you know ghost
16:04
written books and get them out there
16:06

16:10

for this period of time every single
16:14
thing that you decide to do is going to
16:17
affect your career for the long haul
16:20
your branding the way people see you
16:21
whether fans are loyal to you how much
16:24
time you have to write how many genres
16:25
you're writing how many books you're
16:27
writing you know all of these things are
16:29
going to play a factor in the long-term
16:30
success of your career so I just urge
16:33
you that as you make each decision along
16:36
the way instead of just jumping in
16:38
headfirst you really look at how it is
16:40
going to affect your career long term
16:42
alright guys so some difficult truths
16:45

16:48
understand some of the things that I
16:49
wish I had known when I first started
16:51

16:53
some of this is stuff that I really have
16:55
learned the hard way you know strategy
16:58
is really and truly one of the most
17:00
important things that can affect your
17:02
success and if you're looking at
17:03
short-term strategy you're really
17:05
missing out on a lot of great
17:07

17:49
[Music]
breathing's I am sharing so many tips in
0:04
this series on my top 10 like advice and
0:08
lessons learned from eight years of
0:09
successful self publishing and we are on
0:12
to tip number six which is it is vital
0:15
to be good to your fans so you would
Be respectful of your fans
0:22
hope this one goes without saying
0:24
because the truth is none of us would be
0:26
successful or making money or having a
0:29
living or a career as writers if it was
0:32
not for our fans and for the people who
0:34
were interested enough in taking a
0:37
chance on our series or continuing on
0:39
from book to book and supporting us in
0:41
that way we wouldn't be here if it
0:43
weren't for those people and yet it
0:44
seems so often way too often in fact
0:47
that authors tend to think more about
0:50
themselves
0:51
and what they need then about their fans
0:54
and what their fans want or need in
0:57
order to be fulfilled now this is not
1:00
meaning you know I'm not saying that
1:02
this should be confused with like you
1:04
know we have to do everything that our
1:06
fans want us to do because let's face it
1:08
the more you get into this career the
1:10
more that you will find that you know
1:12
fans fall in love with side characters
1:14
and they say oh please write this
1:15
character or please write a spin-off of
1:17
this or please keep writing this one
1:19
series and never write anything else or
1:21
whatever and that would really stifle
1:23
our creativity and you know frankly
1:25
writing a side story for every character
1:27
you've ever written would probably be
1:29
you know not the best use of your time
1:31
in terms of making money and building
1:33
your career as an author especially if
1:35
you had no interest in writing that
1:37
character so you can't necessarily like
1:39
pander to every single thing that your
1:41
fans want you to do and just because
1:44
they may want to see more of certain
1:46
character or more of a series if you
1:48
don't have more story to tell you need
1:50
to ultimately be true to your own
1:52
artistic and creative you know
1:54
sensibilities however that being said
1:57
what I'm talking about is not catering
2:00
to every desire of your fans and if they
2:02
say you know I never want to see this
2:04
again or I want to see this or you
2:05
should write faster not letting that
2:07
kind of stuff stress you out or trying
2:09
to run your career based on those kind
2:10
of requests but what I'm talking about
2:13
is
2:13
being respectful of your fans connecting
2:16
with them letting them know that you
2:17
care about them by not you know frankly
2:20
treating them poorly so here's one
2:23
example of that for a while a tactic
2:26
that was going around and I think I've
2:28
still seen people using this though I
2:30
just can't imagine why is people would
2:33
launch a book at full price so say three
2:36
or four ninety-nine let's say four
2:37
ninety-nine you launch that book you
2:39
send it out to your loyal fans your
2:41
newsletter everywhere else so all of
2:43
your most loyal fans pick up the book
2:45
right away for $4.99 which is full price
2:48
and you use those fans like that wave of
2:51
fans to get yourself up to certain
2:54
ranking on Amazon or whatever vendors
2:56
you're looking at then three days after
2:59
release if you didn't quite hit the
3:01
Amazon top 100 or you know whatever
3:03
vendor you're trying to hit top 100 I
3:05
saw this most happening most often on
3:08
Amazon authors would then drop the price
3:11
of their book to $0.99 three days or
Dont do this
3:14
four days a week after release so what
3:17
the author was thinking was I didn't
3:19
quite hit my goal of getting into the
3:21
top 100 and I know that if I could hit
3:23
the top 100 sales might explode and I
3:26
could hit the USA Today or whatever and
3:28
from a business perspective in the short
3:30
term that could be a great strategy to
3:32
use or great tactic to use however if
3:36
you look at it from a fans point of view
3:38
if you were a super fan and you picked
3:41
up that book at $4.99 on release day and
3:43
then you see three days later that that
3:45
books been discounted already to $1.00
3:47
for the you know people who weren't able
3:49
to pick it up or so excited about it
3:51
like the most loyal people that picked
3:53
it up on day one you would just feel
3:55
marginalized you would feel like you got
3:57
slapped in the face like well I want to
3:59
return the book and I want it for $0.99
4:01
- why did I pay four dollars more just
4:03
to get it three days earlier and you
4:05
know some fans aren't going to mind
4:07
because they want to support you no
4:08
matter what but just in general this is
4:10
not a great way to treat your fans never
4:12
responding to emails now there's you
4:15
know depending on how popular you are if
4:17
you're getting one email every couple of
4:19
weeks it's fine you can probably respond
4:21
to those emails in a polite and you know
4:23
genuine manner but if you're more
4:25
popular and you're getting done
4:26
of emails a day you might not have time
4:28
to respond to every single email but
4:31
making an effort to connect with your
4:33
fans to send them information have some
4:36
kind of place for you to for them to
4:37
come to find information and news out
4:40
for example you need to have a website
4:42
you need to have a place like a blog or
4:44
you know some kind of news on your
4:46
website where people can come to see
4:48
when the next book is coming out or find
4:50
the links to your next book or you know
4:52
to get information about sales or
4:54
whatever else is kind of like your
4:55
little home on the Internet and you
4:57
don't need to be you know every single
5:00
social media platform but it would be
5:02
great for you to at least at minimum
5:03
have a website and be active on one
5:05
social media platform and let your fans
5:07
know that you're there with updates so
5:10
if it's Instagram its Instagram if it's
5:12
Facebook is Facebook or Twitter or
5:13
YouTube or whatever you choose to do but
5:16
at minimum you need to have a website
5:17
and you need to have a newsletter list
5:20
which means that you know in the back of
5:22
your books you have a little sign up
5:23
that says hey if you want to get
5:25
notified about my next release or
5:27
whatever sign up for my newsletter
5:29
now some authors choose to put out a
5:32
newsletter every month where they give
5:33
updates and recommend other authors
5:36
books and they tell about their lives
5:38
and different things like that and a lot
5:39
of readers really enjoy that other
5:41
authors like me right now choose instead
5:44
of spending all that time on a
5:46
newsletter we just send out you know new
5:49
release alerts or news like here's a new
5:51
sale coming up or here's the cover
5:54
reveal and it's only kind of book
5:55
related news rather than like what you
5:57
would consider like a monthly newsletter
Newsletters
5:59
and either way it's fine it's just you
6:01
need a place for people that are really
6:03
interested in your books to sign up so
6:05
that you can communicate with them when
6:07
you have a new release coming out so
6:09
that they know that it's coming and
6:11
keeping that kind of communication up
6:13
respecting them letting them know
6:15
keeping them in the loop having a place
6:17
for people to come and feel like okay I
6:19
see the reading order here and I can see
6:21
a list of all her books and you know all
6:23
that kind of stuff it's super important
6:25
because once you get a fan to take a
6:29
risk on your book out of like the
6:31
millions of books that are out there
6:32
once they've taken that step and they've
6:35
said I want to take a risk on your book
6:37
and they actually enjoyed it you want to
6:39
do every
6:39
you can to bring them into your career
6:43
and your life and your community because
6:45
it's once you have them you need to
6:48
treat them like the true treasure that
6:52
they are because the more fans you can
6:54
collect and keep bringing into your
6:56
community and that you can feel that you
6:58
connect with the more you're going to
7:00
have that long-term career because that
7:02
group of fans will just continue to grow
7:04
but if you're not very good to your fans
7:07
then it doesn't matter how well you
7:08
write you're going to you know grow a
7:10
little bit and then you're gonna be
7:12
constantly losing people
7:13
and then you'll grow a little bit more
7:14
and you'll be constantly losing people
7:16
because you're not treating them well
7:17
you're not keeping them up today you're
7:19
abandoning series you're dropping prices
7:22
you know right after release you're you
7:24
know there's just all kinds of things
7:25
that people do that are just not very
7:28
respectful of their fans and I don't
Respect Your Fans
7:30
think that people usually do it
7:32
specifically to be rude to their fans
7:34
but they're just not putting themselves
7:35
in the place of their fans they're not
7:38
you know at least thinking about it and
7:40
one of the main things I hear people say
7:42
when they make choices like this is well
7:44
you know this is a business this is my
7:46
livelihood and I have to make the right
7:49
decisions for me and while that is true
7:51
to some degree you do need to make the
7:54
decisions that are right for you and for
7:56
your career you have to understand at
7:58
the same time that you would literally
8:00
have no career if it was not for your
8:03
fans and like I said that doesn't mean
8:05
that you need to cater to every single
8:07
one of their wishes or listen to
8:08
everything they say if they're
8:09
complaining about something you've done
8:11
but it doesn't mean that you need to
8:12
show those fans respect you need to be
8:15
grateful for them and you need to make
8:17
sure that every time you make a decision
8:20
that is going to affect your fans you've
8:22
taken their feelings into consideration
8:25
all you have to do is you know if you're
8:27
a writer you're most likely a fan of
8:29
someone
8:30
JK Rowling or Stephen King or Bella
8:33
Andre or who knows what whoever you
8:36
enjoy reading put yourself in that place
8:38
and think okay if JK Rowling did this to
8:40
me or if we want to talk Indies and you
8:42
say you know you're a fan of Bella Andre
8:47
who writes incredible contemporary
8:49
romances if you say okay if Bella Andre
8:52
did this to me
8:53
how would
8:54
I feel about it as a super fan of her
8:56
books and if you think oh my gosh I
8:58
would be so excited about that then it's
8:59
something you know you should definitely
9:01
consider doing but if you really try to
9:03
put yourself in that banned position you
9:05
think gosh if if I bought the book for
9:07
$5.00 and three days later she dropped
9:10
the price tonight nonsense and never
9:12
told us that there was gonna be that
9:13
sale on a new release I would probably
9:15
be pretty upset the first time it
9:17
happened and then if it happened again I
9:19
would probably stop buying her books
9:21
until they went on sale so put yourself
9:23
in that and I'm definitely not saying
9:25
Bella and Ray ever did this I'm just was
9:27
using her as an example of someone you
9:29
might be a fan of but you know put
9:31
yourself in that fan position and see
9:33
how it would make you feel and if it
9:36
makes you kind of you know look at that
9:39
person and think you know I don't think
Conclusion
9:42
they're respecting me or it makes you
9:44
feel kind of squeamish or like that's
9:46
just not a great way to treat your fans
9:47
you know just any business if any
9:49
business treated you like that how would
9:51
you feel and you need to run your
9:53
business that way because your fans are
9:55
your customers and you know there is
9:57
there is really no excuse for treating
10:00
them poorly and you know sometimes your
10:03
fans will treat you poorly I mean I have
10:05
gotten angry emails when a book didn't
10:07
come out when someone wanted it to or
10:09
for writing a cliffhanger or whatever
10:11
and that's just part of it but I get far
10:14
more kind beautiful truly supportive
10:18
messages from my fans than I ever do
10:20
kritis critical messages and you know
10:23
the truth is that I truly love my fans I
10:26
am truly grateful for my fans and so I
10:28
you know I am building a community with
10:30
them and we have kind of a little family
10:32
of people in my sarakin and community
10:36
and that is super super important to me
10:38
and so I just want to stress how
10:40
important it is like critically
10:43
important it is to consider your fans
10:45
feelings in every choice you make and
10:47
yes sometimes you're gonna have to
10:49
choose your own business over you know
10:51
what your fans may want like maybe you
10:53
can't write that spinoff series or maybe
10:55
you do need to switch genres even though
10:57
your fans won't be happy about it
10:58
because you that's what you need but do
11:00
your best to at least consider your fans
11:02
feelings
11:03
be as kind and respectful to them as
11:06
possible and like I said make sure that
11:09
you have a place for them to find
11:11
information about you because once
11:12
they've taken that chance and they loved
11:14
you you got to make it easy for them to
11:16
find out when that next book is coming
11:18
out and what you know what to expect
11:19
from you so newsletter website at least
11:22

[Music]

hey guys i'm back welcome back to heart
0:02
breathings it has been a minute i know i
0:04
am starting this video from our first
0:07
airbnb where we are in the st petersburg
0:09
tampa florida area and we have been here
0:12
for a little over a week and i am just
0:14
now kind of getting back on track with
0:16
videos this is the last week of publish
0:18
and thrive and we have hb 90 coming up
0:20
and starting this weekend so if you want
0:22
to get in on that i'll have all the info
0:23
for you down below but i thought it
0:25
would be the perfect time to go ahead
0:27
and show you what's in my travel
0:30
stationery bag so i have two bags that i
0:32
purchased from amazon you can also get
0:34
these i think from home shopping network
0:36
and from the everything mary website so
0:38
i'll link these down below they are not
0:41
like my absolute favorite design i love
0:43
the black but the kind of orange and
0:45
green flowers is not my favorite but it
0:48
was the best bag i could find after
0:49
doing a bunch of research and i've
0:51
really loved the sturdiness and how much
0:54
stuff i could pack into this bag because
0:56
let me tell you it is stuffed like
0:58
completely stuffed and this doesn't even
1:00
include my like laptop and my ipad and
1:04
some of the other tech stuff like my
1:05
cameras and my lighting because those
1:07
had to go into my backpack and a
1:09
different bag it also doesn't include my
1:12
tarot journal and my five-year journal
1:14
from hobonichi that i keep in my kind of
1:16
witchy box
1:18
to say that out of the family i have the
1:20
most stuff would be an understatement
1:21
but i am running my business from the
1:23
road so that's kind of how i justify it
1:26
but i have completely packed so much of
1:28
my planner stuff in here that it was
1:29
almost difficult to repack it and we
1:32
don't have a whole lot of time left in
1:33
this house so we are going to be getting
1:35
ready to get packed up soon anyway part
1:37
of our plan is that whatever didn't get
1:40
used during this couple of weeks period
1:42
of the first airbnb we're going to
1:44
actually either pack it up and take it
1:46
to donation or i'm gonna send it to my
1:48
cousin kimberly to keep for me but so
1:51
far there have only been a few things i
1:53
haven't used out of here so most of this
1:55
is continuing on with me to our next
1:57
stop so let's get started let me show
1:59
you but first i also wanted to say thank
2:01
you so much for continuing to support me
2:04
and this channel during this time of
2:06
transition if you're watching this and
2:08
you're like where is she why is she in
2:09
an airbnb what's going on i will link
2:12
down below a video for you about travel
2:14
hacks for planners where i discussed
2:16
kind of what happened to the house we
2:18
were building and house we were renting
2:20
and why we're kind of on the road for
2:21
potentially
2:22
the next six months or so so i will have
2:25
that down for you below and let's get
2:27
into what's in this travel stationery
2:30
bag
2:32
[Music]
2:56
okay so here's another look at the bags
2:58
so obviously i have them separated now
3:00
so we have this one
3:02
smaller bag it has a really nice zipper
3:04
pouch in the front that's pretty long
3:06
and these zippers are really easy to
3:08
open it also has on the bottom a second
3:13
zipper bag there and then on the sides
3:15
it has these d rings and it does
3:17
actually come with a separate strap that
3:19
you could wear this as like a crossbody
3:21
bag then it has a really wide opening
3:24
there in the main section and then i
3:26
have it like kind of decorated with some
3:28
little tassels that make it cute
3:30
so you can kind of get a good idea of
3:32
how big that pouch is there as well as
3:34
the one in front which holds an entire
3:36
notebook so i'll show you in just a
3:38
second like what all i have in these but
3:40
i love that the zippers are really kind
3:42
of buttery smooth so i can open them a
3:44
lot of times just with one hand and then
3:46
there's this handy little
3:48
like slip in the back where you can as
3:50
you saw at the beginning
3:52
slip it over that like wheeling kind of
3:55
suitcase thing the little back part
3:58
of this bigger suitcase type one so this
4:01
is the one that has the wheels and it
4:03
has a front pocket and then it has these
4:05
side pockets where you can put some pins
4:07
and various other things there
4:09
and then it also has this second side
4:13
pocket on the other side that has some
4:16
little elastics in it that you can put
4:18
some of your tools and things like that
4:20
then the main part of this like suitcase
4:23
one is this velcro section here and this
4:26
is kind of a neat little setup because
4:27
you've got these top zippers but then
4:30
you also have these zippers on the side
4:32
where you can open the entire thing up
4:34
like if you wanted to just open the
4:36
entire front and pack it that way
4:38
instead of from the top down you could
4:39
do that so there's zippers on both sides
4:42
and i think that is pretty cool
4:44
i have a lot of stuff packed in here so
4:46
i'm kind of anxious to show you all of
4:47
that okay so now that you've seen sort
4:50
of the pockets and how the bags are
4:52
arranged i think the best way to do this
4:53
is just to give you a top-down view and
4:56
actually take everything out so that's
4:57
why i have this coffee table here is i'm
4:59
going to show you how much stuff fits in
5:02
these two bags it's slightly ridiculous
5:04
but it's going to be fun so here we go
5:06
okay so we're going to start with the
5:08
smaller of the two bags and we'll start
5:10
with the outside pockets so you've got
5:12
this top pocket here which for now
5:15
nothing is like the work like most
5:17
organized ever i have just a couple of
5:19
postcards i do have
5:21
some post-it notes from procrasti
5:23
planner etc that say to do doing and
5:25
done
5:27
the postcards are just in case i send
5:28
out giveaways i have some instax
5:31
stickers because we brought our instax
5:33
camera i have some well-kept wipes from
5:36
erin condren that are just like for
5:38
wiping off your devices or your glasses
5:40
and i have a couple of checkbooks here
5:43
for my business in case i need to send
5:45
off any checks or taxes then we have
5:49
two of the new post-it books from erin
5:52
condren i didn't get a chance to do a
5:54
haul like i wanted to before i left but
5:56
these are the new hello kitty erin
5:58
condren
5:59
collab
6:01
post-it notes and i love them
6:03
so i've got those and then there's also
6:05
a star wars book and so i have these as
6:08
well just kind of stuck here in the
6:11
front and that's what fits into this
6:13
little space but you could fit an entire
6:15
pencil case or something like that in
6:17
here too it's pretty long
6:20
in this bottom
6:22
pocket here i turn it a little bit for
6:24
you it's big enough to fit an entire b5
6:27
archer and olive notebook i debated on
6:30
whether i wanted to bring this one this
6:31
is my
6:32
b5 that's going to be my kind of witchy
6:34
bullet journal it has white craft and
6:36
black pages in it and i finally decided
6:39
to bring it even though i might not set
6:41
this up until 2022 i wanted to go ahead
6:44
and bring it so that's an entire b5
6:46
notebook
6:50
i also have some stickers in here that i
6:52
haven't yet put into my main sticker
6:54
album so i'll show you that pretty soon
6:55
and then some other things for kind of
6:57
decorating my a5 journal
7:00
and then i have all of my business cards
7:02
so they're just kind of stuck in here
7:04
like i said not the greatest job of
7:05
organization because we were so busy the
7:07
last few days so i probably should take
7:10
some time to do more organization now
7:12
that we're here and put some rubber
7:14
bands or whatever around it but i have
7:15
my heart breathings business cards and i
7:17
have my sarah cannon business cards
7:19
because i'm going to be speaking at the
7:20
nink conference in a couple of weeks and
7:22
i wanted to make sure i had business
7:23
cards with me so that's what fits in the
7:25
outer pockets here then this main
7:28
section of this smaller bag is
7:31
specifically built to fit one of those
7:33
big scrapbooking
7:35
totes so like if you've ever been to
7:37
michael's and you've seen the large
7:39
scrapbooking page things that are the 16
7:41
by 16 it will fit in here perfectly
7:44
i did not bring one of those however but
7:46
i do have a lot of other stuff stuffed
7:48
in here so
7:49
first i have an entire
7:52
pin case this is the accordion file pen
7:55
case from erin condren it has six
7:57
compartments and this one is completely
7:59
filled up with like acrylograph pens and
8:03
pins that write well on black and craft
8:05
paper so this is going to be the
8:08
main source of the painting and
8:11
different things that i'll use for the
8:12
switchy bullet journal i also have some
8:14
sections with some
8:16
glue sticks and again some of the things
8:19
that i'll be using actually i need to go
8:21
ahead and pull that one out but some of
8:23
the things that i'll be using for
8:25
my main a5 journals over the next few
8:28
months that just aren't ready yet so
8:30
it's a little bit of odds and ends but
8:32
mostly it's pens
8:34
and things like
8:36
adhesive tape
8:37
now this usually stays out with me
8:39
because
8:40
this is my a5 planner that i'm using for
8:43
the month of september so i probably
8:45
will go ahead and take that cloth and
8:47
paper thing and put it in here so i
8:48
don't forget to use it but i do have it
8:50
all set up for the month of september
8:52
including my september hb 90 pages that
8:55
i just had printed off at fedex
8:58
next i have an erin condren folio this
9:02
is the 7x9 folio and in it i have some
9:05
stickers and i have basically what is a
9:09
franken-planned monthly planner so i
9:11
only took the months through the end of
9:13
december
9:14
and you can see i've been working on
9:15
like editorial calendar and
9:17
brainstorming and things like that and
9:19
then the entire back is an entire
9:21
notebook full of pages along with some
9:24
stickers in the back and you can see
9:25
evie already decorated it
9:27
this i will talk about more in the
9:28
notebook challenge
9:34
next i have my kindle i have a kindle
9:36
voyage which i'm not even sure if they
9:38
make these anymore i've had it for
9:39
several years might be time for an
9:41
upgrade but i have loved this one so
9:43
i've got all my books loaded into there
9:47
i have an additional moleskine notebook
9:49
that is not being used yet but it's in
9:51
here in case i need it
9:56
and you can see i've actually been using
9:58
this but this is an erin condren stand
10:01
that's just their acrylic stand and it
10:03
comes apart which is great because then
10:05
i can put it in really flat
10:07
but
10:08
it's awesome because it will stand up on
10:10
the desk and this has become my little
10:13
kanban board for
10:15
the trip so i'll show you the rest of
10:17
the solution in just a minute
10:19
so i told you we brought our instax
10:21
camera so i have
10:23
i think i have maybe six extra things of
10:26
film so we'll be slowly using these up
10:29
as we go
10:34
i have my entire dell phonics pouch now
10:36
this is a huge dell phonics pouch and it
10:39
has
10:39
my la vigreola hello kitty which is
10:42
numbered it's 20 of 80. there were only
10:44
80 of these made and i love it so i've
10:45
been having that on the end all my
10:47
little pins and different things here if
10:49
you guys want to see a kind of like
10:51
what's in my dell phonics pouch video i
10:53
can show you i have some washi tape here
10:55
on the side and then i also have most of
10:59
my
11:00
tapes and
11:02
my zig clean color dot markers in here
11:04
but i can do a more thorough walk
11:05
through but it's mostly pens in this one
11:08
and the final thing in here is just a
11:10
ziploc baggie that has other things that
11:13
i'll use to decorate my a5 planner as we
11:15
go throughout the few months so it has
11:17
some
11:18
moon stuff some extra paper clips some
11:20
extra alligator clips and some halloween
11:23
paper clips and some of these erin
11:25
condren ones so it's just kind of bits
11:27
and bobs that i will use to kind of
11:29
continue to switch up my planner a
11:31
little bit and decorate a little
11:32
differently i also have some laminated
11:35
book covers of mine because i use those
11:37
when i'm doing some of my plotting
11:40
okay so here's an overall look of all
11:42
the stuff that fit into that one bag
11:45
it's a lot and now we have the entire
11:48
second bag now this one has these two
11:50
zippers that come all the way down on
11:52
the sides and then they do have a little
11:54
bit of velcro here but i've been having
11:57
a hard time making it completely fit so
12:00
we're going to start with the outer
12:01
pockets again so on
12:03
this side we have well both sides we
12:06
have pockets that go all the way down so
12:08
they open all the way up and then inside
12:11
they just have a few this side has just
12:13
a couple it's for elastic pieces so
12:16
inside i've got my
12:20
single hole punch
12:22
and a pair of scissors with a cover on
12:24
them i have my holder for my phone for
12:28
like a selfie stick
12:31
and then i have my washi tape book now
12:33
you guys saw that i had planned to take
12:35
most of my washi collection and put it
12:37
in here and i just didn't end up getting
12:39
the time to do all the ones i wanted to
12:41
do but i got you know a good amount in
12:43
here so i'm just going to keep those as
12:45
is even though i didn't fill it all the
12:46
way up
12:48
when it comes to this middle
12:51
section here it's mostly notebooks
12:53
that just kind of got stuffed in but i
12:55
have one of these clips that's one of my
12:58
larger ones i also have my samsung
13:01
earbuds these are my galaxy earbuds so i
13:03
use these a lot
13:07
you'll see that i have put in a few
13:08
little items that came from the
13:11
erin condren surprise box i literally
13:13
got it the day we were leaving so i
13:15
grabbed the things i really wanted to
13:16
use including this metal asterisk pen
13:18
holder clip
13:20
i haven't opened it yet
13:23
this is something we had to buy once we
13:25
got on the road it is a
13:28
sd card reader that goes from usb to sd
13:31
card so that i can move my footage from
13:33
this camera that i'm using onto my
13:35
laptop
13:38
i have an a6 stylogy notebook that i had
13:41
only partially used before and i want to
13:43
see if i can start using this for
13:46
daily affirmations but i haven't started
13:48
using it yet but this is on the list to
13:49
be used so you'll see more about this in
13:51
the notebook challenge
13:56
i have just a small hello kitty notebook
13:58
that has pages that i can kind of rip
14:01
out of it if i want to just make some
14:03
quick notes plus it's super cute
14:07
this is going to seem a little bit
14:08
excessive but i do have two of these
14:11
hello kitty tabs
14:13
things because i've been going through
14:14
them and i've already used up an entire
14:17
book and so i wanted to bring a lot of
14:18
them because i do use them a lot so i do
14:20
for now have two of those plus they fit
14:23
perfectly in this side pocket
14:28
i have an entire set of stickers from
14:31
erin condren so these are sticker books
14:34
that i collected over the years that i
14:36
have been using in various ways in my
14:38
notebooks so i have this in a stack
14:41
sticker book that i got off of amazon
14:42
last year
14:45
i also have a couple other notebooks so
14:47
this is one of the new star wars erin
14:49
condren notebooks this is the vegan
14:51
leather one that has princess leia on it
14:53
as well as my initials inside it is just
14:57
plain lined paper but i do want to use
14:59
this maybe a few months till i get to it
15:01
but i've got this one in there as well
15:06
and this is one of my favorite notebooks
15:08
it says choose kindness happiness
15:10
friendship and this is one of their new
15:12
hello kitty notebooks that actually has
15:14
some of the sanrio characters on the
15:16
pages which i really love like the star
15:18
wars ones they don't have any of the
15:20
characters on there it's just plain
15:22
blank pages but this has all perforated
15:24
pages with like pachaco and choco cat
15:27
and
15:28
tuxedo sam and some of the other
15:29
characters so it's pretty cool to see
15:31
that in here and it's a lot of pages so
15:34
i had to bring that with me
15:36
it's cute on the back too
15:38
in the bottom i have some things that
15:39
have kind of fallen out of stuff like
15:41
some stickers a glasses cleaner
15:43
this little baby yoda from
15:46
coffee monsters co and some other little
15:48
clips so i'll need to find a better home
15:50
for those
15:51
and then i also have some disney
15:53
countdown stickers we'll be going to
15:55
disney in october around halloween so i
15:58
want to use these i printed them out
16:00
before we left
16:01
on the opposite side we have another
16:03
zipper that goes all the way around
16:07
and opens up this entire section another
16:10
item that i was not able to properly do
16:12
a haul on that i have loved are these
16:14
mini gel pens so i will tell you right
16:17
now they have two sets of these in their
16:19
new collection one is just this entire
16:22
set of mini gel pens in a ton of
16:24
different colors and some of them are
16:26
glitter colors but the other is a hello
16:28
kitty set that i think only has eight
16:30
but these especially the bright ones and
16:32
the white one these look so good in the
16:35
black paper i was shocked but i will
16:37
show you an example of this in the
16:38
notebook challenge because they are
16:40
super super cool highly highly recommend
16:42
these mini gel pens
16:44
plus they come in a really cool case
16:47
i have this little hello kitty date book
16:49
that i track some of our family things
16:51
in and then i have some of my
16:53
act
16:54
1 act 2 act 3 plot notes that just come
16:57
from a variety of different books that
16:59
i've studied on plotting so those are in
17:00
here on index cards and then i just have
17:03
these tabs that i've been using from
17:04
erin condren there's one falling out
17:08
you can also see a handful of markers
17:10
here that i'm not going to take out but
17:12
this is five of the brush pens from erin
17:15
condren and four of the crayola super
17:18
tips that i use most often
17:21
i know you saw it before but it does
17:23
have this cool um
17:26
like suitcase handle and it does have
17:27
wheels on the back so that makes it
17:29
easier to carry around one thing they
17:31
don't have in this version that they did
17:33
have in a previous version is they used
17:36
to have a thing like a strap so that you
17:38
could put this up and then
17:40
strap this
17:43
section here up so that it would hold up
17:45
and stay up and they for some reason
17:47
have stopped doing that and i really
17:49
wish they would have brought that back
17:50
because it is definitely annoying when
17:52
i'm trying to roll through it that it
17:53
just continues to like flap over but
17:55
that's probably one of my only
17:56
complaints
17:57
so
17:58
this part is definitely packed so i have
18:01
another one of the accordion cases from
18:03
erin condren this one's more colorful so
18:05
you've probably seen it in some of my
18:06
instagram photos this has all of my
18:09
markers and highlighters it has extra
18:11
pen refills for my favorite pens it has
18:13
my corner rounder and some glue sticks
18:17
and my adhesive tape
18:24
all of my erin condren dual tip markers
18:26
and things like that also some of my
18:29
stabilo markers and some pencils
18:33
i have
18:34
some
18:35
hello kitty and my melody pencils as
18:38
well as some of my favorite paper mate
18:40
inkjoys
18:48
and i do have some extra things in here
18:50
like extra ollie clips that i'll use
18:52
with my planner later i have a little
18:54
erin condren pen case so or scissors
18:58
so this is maybe a little bit redundant
19:00
because like i don't necessarily need
19:02
this pair of scissors and this pair of
19:04
scissors so i probably over packed in
19:07
that respect
19:08
so
19:09
don't judge me
19:12
my solution to the washi tape since i
19:14
didn't have time to put everything in
19:16
that book was this very large pouch i
19:19
got from the warehouse sale from erin
19:20
condren and i actually really love it
19:22
because this color pink matches my
19:25
gillio cover perfectly and it fits a ton
19:27
of washi in here i'm not sure how many
19:29
washi's i have but i just kind of picked
19:31
my favorite ones as i was packing and
19:33
threw them in here and i did try to pick
19:36
ones that seemed as much as possible
19:38
like mostly used so that hopefully i can
19:41
get rid of them and maybe buy new ones
19:43
as i go like this crow one is kind of
19:45
birds i guess is one of my favorites and
19:47
it's almost used so once that's used
19:49
maybe i can go buy some new ones
19:51
so i've got a washi bag
19:53
i pulled this out briefly and i did a
19:55
setup video on this as well but this is
19:57
my b6 stylogy in a gilio a punto blush
20:01
croc cover i have it all set up so
20:03
nicely and i have actually been really
20:07
using this almost on a daily basis i've
20:09
been doing my tarot draw here and this
20:11
is my basically my daily
20:15
notes for various things that are going
20:17
on as well as some course notes that i'm
20:18
taking so i'll show you this more in the
20:20
notebook challenge coming up this
20:22
weekend
20:24
for time tracking since i wasn't able to
20:26
bring my full-time tracking planner i
20:28
have my timeler device and the base of
20:31
it is somewhere locked inside here so
20:33
i'll find it as we go through but this
20:35
is just an eight-sided device kind of a
20:38
pyramid-shaped device that connects to
20:41
my phone and it whatever side i put it
20:43
on so if i lay it like this then it'll
20:45
be tracking my heart breathing's tasks
20:46
if i lay it like this it's tracking my
20:48
courses and so i can track my time with
20:50
this and it does it digitally so if you
20:52
want to see a video on how this is
20:54
working for me because i did try the
20:56
time flip two and i tried the timeler
20:58
and i prefer this so if you want to see
21:00
a video on that let me know in the
21:01
comments
21:06
so this is another erin condren pouch
21:08
this has all of my tabs and edgers so
21:12
when i'm doing i'd also have a couple
21:13
little clips in here but this is mostly
21:15
tabs and things like that that i use to
21:18
mark the edges of my pages and i've been
21:20
pulling into this like it seems a little
21:22
extra to have a bunch of tabs but i've
21:24
been using something from this every
21:25
single day since we've been on the road
21:31
this is another little section that has
21:33
some extra like cloth and paper tabs and
21:35
things like that that i will work my way
21:37
through as we go
21:40
so this is a bandeau pouch that has a
21:43
little poof from simply gilded one of
21:44
the subscription boxes and this thing is
21:47
filled to the brim with hobonichi weeks
21:49
stickers which is what is in my wallet
21:52
and then a bunch of vellum and acetate
21:55
that i've been using inside that stylogy
21:57
and some other stickers like procrasti
21:59
planner and so some others like some
22:01
journaling
22:03
cards and things that i have in here and
22:06
this also is something i've been using
22:08
every single day since we got on the
22:09
road
22:11
of course in order to customize my
22:13
planner as we go i also have my six hole
22:16
punch for my a5
22:18
pages
22:20
i brought a second a5 planner i've kind
22:23
of discussed this a little bit but you
22:25
guys know if you've been around my
22:26
channel for a while that i love to
22:28
switch out my planner every single month
22:30
and i'm not gonna be able to bring
22:32
obviously like six different planners
22:33
with me so i just brought two
22:36
the one that you saw that was the pink
22:37
one is the one i'm currently using so
22:39
all of my extra pages that i have like
22:41
the entire q4 planner and some of my
22:44
erin condren pages for the rest of the
22:46
year are all stored in here this is one
22:48
of the newer kiki k quilted planners and
22:51
then i just have some extra like cloth
22:52
and paper inserts and kiki inserts here
22:58
and i've been storing all of that in the
23:00
dust pouch that it came with so it
23:02
doesn't damage the planner when i'm
23:03
bringing it in and out
23:06
next i have a set of erin condren hello
23:09
kitty collab folders some of these are
23:12
not being used yet but they may be used
23:14
as we move forward and they don't take
23:15
up much space
23:17
but i do have four that are being used
23:20
pretty regularly so this one is holding
23:22
my pages of demons forever which i'm
23:24
currently reading live on my sarah
23:26
cannon channel so i've got the pages in
23:27
here for that and then i also have
23:30
basically my kanban board is in here so
23:32
on this folder this is my to do stuff
23:35
and this is the stuff that's done
23:37
and then the stuff that's currently in
23:39
progress is going on that erin condren
23:41
acrylic board that you saw so this is
23:44
kind of my three sections of the planner
23:46
is to do then doing is on the acrylic
23:48
and done is over here so i am really
23:51
enjoying this and i think it's working
23:53
out well for me so far
23:54
as a travel kanban board
23:59
i have a few extra covers for my erin
24:02
condren notebooks like including one for
24:03
halloween that's coming up and some of
24:06
this new hello kitty ones that just came
24:08
out
24:12
this was an item from the surprise box
24:15
for fall and it's basically a
24:18
little weekly
24:20
thing that stands up like a weekly folio
24:22
i haven't used this yet so if i end up
24:24
not using it just yet i'll probably send
24:26
it to my cousin and use it when i get
24:27
home whenever we pick a home or get
24:29
settled but i did bring it with me
24:31
because it was brand new and i just
24:32
wanted to see if i would use it i
24:34
haven't used it yet but it's super cute
24:39
this is another one of the large folios
24:42
and inside i have
24:44
my teacher planner so i've got some more
24:47
of my color coordinated erin condren
24:49
dual tip markers and some of my teacher
24:51
planner stickers and then we have the
24:53
teacher planner that we've been using
24:55
for homeschool for andrew which actually
24:58
just started this week so that is all in
25:01
here along with the customized stickers
25:03
that i got from the erin condren website
25:09
and last but not least i have
25:12
this amy tangerine folder so or i guess
25:16
this is an avery amy tangerine three
25:19
ring binder
25:20
that is where i have all my stickers and
25:22
i did do a quick instagram reel if you
25:25
want to go follow me over there at heart
25:27
breathings on instagram where i showed
25:29
how i did this but basically i took all
25:31
of my small stickers from like studio
25:33
adorkable and procrasti planner and
25:35
coffee monsters co and
25:37
paper and milk and just all my favorite
25:39
shops and i organized them according to
25:41
theme and i put them inside these little
25:44
photo album sleeves from amazon i have
25:47
all of this linked in my amazon store
25:49
all of this like binder and the photo
25:51
pages and so far this is working out
25:53
extremely well and i was able to bring
25:56
most of my stickers with me even though
25:58
it does make my bag pretty heavy
26:01
so here is a look at everything that
26:03
fits in those two bags like all put out
26:06
stretched out on the coffee table
26:09
as i am looking at all of it i'm
26:11
realizing this is probably pretty crazy
26:14
to those of you who don't have as many
26:16
stationery supplies but in terms of
26:19
taking my entire huge office and packing
26:22
it in those two bags i'm pretty proud of
26:24
myself and i feel like i did a pretty
26:25
good job considering
26:29
okay so that is a look inside all of the
26:32
amount of stuff that fits into these two
26:34
small bags and of course this does take
26:36
up about the size of an entire suitcase
26:39
in the back of our car so i'm very glad
26:41
that we ended up buying a new car
26:43
because it would not have fit otherwise
26:45
and of course
26:46
some of this stuff probably is greatly
26:49
unnecessary but i did pare down as much
26:52
as i felt i could and i feel like over
26:53
the course of the trip i will continue
26:55
to pare down and let go of things that i
26:57
don't need but i was just thinking about
26:59
like i don't know if i'll be back to my
27:01
normal things in six months or even a
27:04
year and so i brought things that i
27:05
thought would still continue to bring me
27:07
joy and help me run my business and
27:10
keep my basic planner system the way
27:12
that it has been
27:13
for the past several years without too
27:15
much disruption to that so we'll see how
27:17
it evolves over the course of the next
27:19
several months but so far this is
27:22
everything that i brought and i'm
27:23
looking forward to showing you a little
27:25
bit of an inside look at the actual
27:28
notebook challenge i will be recording
27:29
that video hopefully later today or
27:31
tomorrow so that will go up sometimes
27:33
this weekend or early next week thank
27:35
you again for your patience in me
27:37
getting these videos out a little bit
27:39
off schedule but hopefully we're gonna
27:41
be getting back to a schedule pretty
27:42
soon because we have preptober coming up
27:45
in the month of october and the
27:47
nanowrimo diaries will be back for the
27:50
month of november so i hope you're
27:51
looking forward to that i have a ton of
27:53
new videos coming out for you
27:55
during the october november time period
27:57
so i'm really looking forward to that
27:59
and kind of showing how i'm getting into
28:01
writing routines as we're on the road
28:03
instead of in our normal space and that
28:05
kind of thing if you want to see a look
28:07
at the tech stuff that i brought like
28:09
the things i brought for my writing like
28:11
my laptop my keyboard any of my like
28:13
microphones and things like that let me
28:15

28:16

28:18
thing and if you want to see some videos
28:21

28:23

28:26

29:22
[Music]
29:39
you

hey everybody welcome back to Hart
0:01
breathing's I thought it would be fun to
0:03
show you an inside look at what goes
0:05
inside of my pencil case when I'm out
0:08
writing so this is the Lee hit lab I
0:11
think is how you say it
0:12
smart fit this is the one in green or
0:15
more of a teal color it does come in a
0:17
couple of different colors so I just
0:19
wanted to show you guys what I take out
0:21
with me sadly there has been no going
0:24
out for a while so hopefully we'll get
0:27
back to that soon so in hopes of better
0:29
days let's take a look at what's inside
0:32
[Music]
0:35
okay so first of all this pencil case is
0:38
nice and slim and I like the fact that
0:40
you can really put it into your backpack
0:42
in kind of a corner this way or you
0:44
could put it kind of at the bottom like
0:46
this you can fit quite a bit and it is a
0:48
pretty structured organized bag it comes
0:51
in several different colors you can get
0:53
this on Amazon
0:54
jetpens and probably lots of other sites
0:57
online this little white part here
0:59
because I have used this for a couple of
1:01
years has started to kind of get dirty
1:04
so I'm not sure if I could just throw
1:06
this in the washing machine or not but I
1:08
might try that it also has a total of
1:11
three zipper so it has two zippers in
1:13
this white section and then this teal
1:15
section that opens all the way up has
1:17
another zipper I have chosen to put a
1:19
couple of little charms on these I've
1:21
got a little ice-cream cone and then a
1:23
doughnut Ella
1:24
well Hello Kitty dressed up as a
1:26
tokidoki Donatella so that is what I
1:30
have there and it just makes me happy to
1:32
have them it looks cute when it's
1:33
sitting down and I just love taking it
1:35
with me alright so let's take a look at
1:37
what's inside this is how I would
1:39
typically have it packed up if I were
1:41
going out writing so this first pocket
1:44
here in the front doesn't open all the
1:46
way like the second one does it just
1:48
opens on the half and you can fit a lot
1:51
it's kind of structured in that it has a
1:53
somewhat slim little you know pocket
1:55
here and then it has these two elastic
1:58
pockets so you can really fill it with a
2:00
lot of things if you organize it
2:02
correctly so I'm just going to pull
2:03
everything out so the first thing that I
2:05
have here are my samsung galaxy buds I
2:08
absolutely love these I ended up
2:10
actually getting these free with my
2:12
some note 10-plus that I just got some
2:17
time early or late sometime late last
2:19
year and I wasn't sure if I would love
2:22
these or not but I have absolutely loved
2:24
them and I love that it does fit in most
2:26
of my little pencil cases as long as I
2:28
just remember to take it with me another
2:30
cool thing about these earbuds is that
2:32
they can charge off your phone which is
2:35
kind of cool you can put them on the
2:36
back of your phone and they can charge
2:37
off your phone and they can also charge
2:39
you can charge the case and then the
2:42
buds can charge inside the case if the
2:44
case has a charge so that's pretty cool
2:46
in case you were worried about like
2:47
using them up I also always carry some
2:50
kind of lip balm this is the eos
2:52
peppermint one i absolutely love their
2:55
lip balms so i pretty much always carry
2:59
one with me just a few other things here
3:02
I have the Hoban Ichi green stencil that
3:05
has some numbers and the thing I use it
3:08
mostly for is either just a straight
3:10
edge or also these little check boxes
3:13
that are just the boxes in a row I don't
3:16
know why I love that so much but I do
3:18
then I also have this little tokidoki
3:22
card wallet thing and it's such a little
3:25
card holder and I have my business cards
3:28
for both of my businesses in here so it
3:30
has two little slots so just in case if
3:33
I'm out I get talking to somebody else
3:35
who's like oh what are you writing I
3:36
often have like a little laptop skin on
3:38
that has my book cover in you know on my
3:41
laptop or my Chromebook so a lot of
3:43
times people will ask me oh are you a
3:45
writer and then they ask about my book
3:46
so then I have a card here to give them
3:48
that has all my information on it then I
3:51
also have a heart breathing card if
3:54
they're a writer themselves and they
3:56
want to you know learn more about it so
3:58
I've got those two kind of cards with me
4:00
at all times just in case I want to
4:03
connect with someone and give them my
4:04
email address or whatever then a few
4:09
more things that I have in this main
4:10
pocket so I always carry some kind of
4:12
stickers these are usually ones that I
4:14
made myself that I might use when I'm
4:17
brainstorming like if I'm using I'm
4:19
doing a plot a lot of times I'll have
4:21
different colored dots with me just so I
4:23
can make sure that I can mark the plot
4:26
with those and I like to since I'm
4:28
printing them myself I like to cut them
4:29
down slim so they fit inside the pencil
4:32
case then I pretty much always also have
4:35
some kind of washi tape card with me
4:38
this is a card that I got from the
4:40
simply gilded subscription box and it's
4:42
just loaded up with ironically no simply
4:45
gilded tapes but just some of the washi
4:47
tapes that I was using at the moment and
4:49
if this is a good way to carry multiple
4:51
types of tape without having to actually
4:54
take an entire roll with you which can
4:56
take a lot of space then I also have the
4:58
Erin Condren well-kept wipes these are
5:01
just basically screen cleaning wipes so
5:03
you can clean your glasses or your
5:05
screens your phone screen or whatever
5:07
and I actually find these to be like
5:09
really juicy so I can sometimes take
5:12
them out use them on a screen and put
5:14
them back inside you might not be
5:16
supposed to do that but I like to do it
5:18
because you can actually get several
5:19
uses out of them but it's the perfect
5:20
size to go into the little bag then I
5:25
almost always have some kind of cash
5:26
with me this time I just have a five
5:28
dollar bill in there sometimes I have a
5:30
twenty dollar bill because there have
5:31
been so many times I have gone out to
5:33
write and I go to get a coffee or
5:35
something and find that I forgot my
5:37
wallet which why would I do that I don't
5:40
know but it just happened to me several
5:42
times the two main things I always
5:44
forget are my earbuds and my wallet so
5:46
it's always a win if I can remember that
5:48
but as long as I have some cash in my
5:51
pencil case then I know I've always got
5:53
something to take with me so the rest of
5:57
this little first compartment here also
6:00
has not easy to see and it's mostly like
6:03
it used to have gold on it and you can
6:05
maybe kind of ski it a little bit but
6:07
for the most part it's actually rubbed
6:08
off because I've had this for a long
6:10
time but this is just a Kate Spade ruler
6:12
it's really flimsy but it still works
6:14
nice if you need a ruler to measure
6:16
stuff it's just it's I probably need to
6:18
replace it because it's starting to rub
6:20
off the numbers I also have an entire
6:23
set of refills here of some of my pencil
6:26
0.5 millimeter I got this at the Sanrio
6:29
store years and years ago and I just
6:30
refill it whenever I need more pencil
6:34
lead
6:35
I also have a couple of Erin Condren
6:39
dual tip markers so these have a medium
6:41
point which I like that medium marker
6:43
point but they also have this really
6:45
nice fine point that kind of works
6:47
similar to a felt tip pen or a plastic
6:49
nib pen and I really like these markers
6:52
and I have them in pretty much all the
6:54
colors that they offer and you can't fit
6:57
a ton of them down in here now if that's
6:59
all you had you could probably fit ten
7:01
or more in here but because I have all
7:04
this other stuff I usually only carry
7:05
two or three with me and I'll just carry
7:07
the ones that are relevant to whatever
7:09
color coding I'm doing for my current
7:11
plot then I always carry a couple of
7:15
these little clips as well just in case
7:17
I need to clip some papers together or
7:19
some note cards together so that's this
7:22
whole first compartment then you have
7:25
these two a little elastic compartment
7:28
so what I keep in here typically is this
7:31
is a tombow mini power tape so this is
7:34
like a glue tape that's just you know an
7:36
adhesive sort of roller and it's pretty
7:38
compact so it's easy to carry around
7:40
then I also have a little set of
7:43
scissors so this is something that I got
7:46
from jetpens which is truly one of my
7:48
favorite shops to get little things like
7:51
this like unique things this was not
7:53
very expensive but it's super useful so
7:55
it has a little cap to it you could also
7:57
stick it on to you know some kind of
7:59
zipper or something like that if you
8:01
wanted to but basically it's a set of
8:03
scissors so you pull the top off and you
8:05
just have this little set of scissors
8:07
and what you do is you take these little
8:11
doohickeys here I don't know what you
8:13
call them and you push them down and now
8:14
you have the little rings to put your
8:16
fingers in and you've got a set of
8:18
scissors and they come in multiple
8:19
colors they're not super crazy sharp but
8:22
they're sharp enough to cut up a little
8:25
piece of paper if you wanted to or a
8:28
piece of washi tape sometimes I will
8:31
also in addition to the stickers just
8:32
throw a couple little scraps of paper in
8:34
here that's like scrap baked
8:36
scrapbooking paper or something like
8:38
that so that I can cut a little bit out
8:39
tape it down and sort of art journal at
8:42
while I'm out so pretty nifty little
8:45
pair of scissors that you can really
8:47
kind of high
8:48
inside your pencil case without taking
8:50
up too much room then you can see I also
8:53
am a crystal girl so I almost always
8:55
have some crystals sometimes I have
8:58
little Hello Kitty figurines in this
8:59
little section so right now I have an
9:01
amethyst in there and then in the second
9:04
little section here I have another
9:06
crystal this is just a rose quartz point
9:09
and it's a really light pink it almost
9:12
looks like a clear quartz but it's a
9:13
rose quartz point that I will sometimes
9:16
put on my laptop just while I'm writing
9:19
for energy and beauty then I have a
9:23
pencil eraser that is from Erin Condren
9:26
it just says my bad and finally I have
9:29
this little set of page flags so if I
9:31
want to flag something in my plot or
9:34
also sometimes I'll be out if I'm out at
9:36
Barnes & Noble or wherever I'll be
9:38
reading a book and I might want to make
9:41
some notes with one of my pins and then
9:44
have a page flag there so I've got these
9:46
little page flags I got these years ago
9:48
at books-a-million
9:48
and they were 50 Cent's because I got
9:52
them on clearance and I've just I've got
9:53
like four or five sets of them and I
9:55
just feel like I never have to buy page
9:57
flags again because I have so many so
10:00
that's everything that fits inside this
10:02
little section here then in the second
10:07
section what I love about this one is
10:09
that it zips all the way open so I'm
10:11
just going to move this stuff over and
10:13
look how nicely that opens it literally
10:15
opens all the way which I like because
10:18
then I don't have to like dig into stuff
10:20
this is why this Lee hid lab one is one
10:23
of my absolute favorites and I apologize
10:25
if I'm saying that wrong but I love it
10:27
so much because it just opens like this
10:30
you can open it set it beside you and
10:32
it's super functional so in this right
10:36
section I have pretty much these are my
10:38
favorite pins right now and I have them
10:40
in the colorful pack so these are the
10:43
pilot precise v v RT and the RT just
10:46
stands for retractable look how super
10:48
fine point that is it's really really
10:52
nice fine point Inc and I just love the
10:55
way they write because you can kind of
10:57
stay a little bit further away from the
10:59
page because it's such a long fine point
11:01
out
11:02
know why I love these so much but I do I
11:05
don't have the black one in here with me
11:07
right now but I have all the other
11:08
colors I also just have this little
11:10
bookmark that I made out of my own or a
11:13
paper clip that I made out of one of my
11:15
own paper clips and some of my extra
11:16
ribbon and it just kind of adds a little
11:18
bit of pretty on there and it kind of
11:20
matches the color of the case itself so
11:22
I have that then in the back here just
11:25
kind of for decoration and inspiration I
11:27
have a few other things tucked behind
11:29
those pins so I just cut this little
11:34
piece of scrapbooking paper down to size
11:36
because I liked the little gemstones and
11:38
I will from time to time just sort of
11:41
trade this out this is really not
11:42
functional at all it's just for looks
11:44
and I also like this little wonton
11:46
in-a-million
11:47
paper clip then I also carry a couple of
11:51
different tarot cards with me so this is
11:53
from my everyday witch tarot deck and I
11:57
tend to carry two cards with me the
11:59
Empress is my yearly growth card this
12:02
comes from a book and from some of my
12:04
Tarot lessons I was taking with a life
12:06
coach that I had named Tonya Gonzales I
12:09
will link some of her stuff down below
12:11
she's amazing we have been working
12:12
together for years but the Empress is my
12:15
lifetime card and then my yearly card
12:17
for 2020 is hurrah the will fortune so I
12:21
tend to carry my yearly growth card and
12:24
my lifetime growth card then I also did
12:28
a yearly Tarot like prediction thing
12:31
with Tonya every year I do at the end of
12:33
the year for the for the next year and
12:35
so a lot of times I also will pull out
12:38
my monthly card I just don't have my
12:40
month card of the month here because I
12:43
haven't been going out so that's been
12:44
more in my tarot section so I like to
12:47
just leave those where I can see them if
12:48
I need them for inspiration I'll pull
12:50
them out when I'm journaling or whatever
12:51
I also like the mesh on these cases so
12:56
that you can actually put pins another
12:58
little flare and stuff like that on here
13:00
so I have this Ruby pin which is one of
13:03
my favorite anime absolutely love it we
13:05
were just talking about this on my other
13:07
channel I was reading I'm reading an
13:09
original story called the witch's key
13:10
every day live at 4 p.m. if you want to
13:13
come join us the story is almost
13:14
finished but I think
13:15
we're gonna keep it going but I'll link
13:17
that for you down below as well but we
13:19
were just talking about our favorite
13:20
anime and Ruby is definitely one of mine
13:22
I also have well this little fabric one
13:25
is from a Sanrio loot crate and then
13:28
these two are actually antique buttons
13:31
that my husband's older sister had in
13:36
just her collection that were her
13:38
daughters when she was little so these
13:39
are like 20 something years old maybe 18
13:43
to 20 years old and so you can't get
13:45
them anymore they're totally antiques
13:47
and she gave me those for Christmas so I
13:48
was really excited to have them so I'm
13:50
keeping them in here where they will
13:51
stay good but I can use them and be
13:54
happy I also have this other little
13:57
magnetic clip that is a tokidoki
13:59
character here and it just kind of clips
14:02
on all right so in this second section
14:05
here I have a few little things in this
14:08
little sort of mesh elastic pocket so I
14:13
just have a couple other page flags
14:15
sometimes I use these when I'm plotting
14:17
and making notes that I like not ready
14:20
to commit a thought onto paper yet but I
14:22
will commit them onto here so that I can
14:24
move them around like if I think this
14:26
might happen or this scene might happen
14:27
I will put them on this kind of thing
14:31
instead of putting them in pen until I
14:33
know for sure then I also just have this
14:36
little I don't know what you call this
14:37
but this is I think typically for like
14:39
floss or for some kind of sewing stuff
14:43
but I have used it for washi tape and so
14:46
I just have a couple of different tapes
14:48
on here and these are actually simply
14:49
gilded tapes and it fits perfectly there
14:52
then I also have a little thing of pin
14:55
tel correction tape so this is the 4
14:57
millimeter which is one of the smaller
14:59
ones in terms of width so I always have
15:02
a little bit of correction tape with me
15:04
just in case I mess up as well so that
15:06
kind of gets tucked in right there I'm
15:09
gonna put it out here so later you guys
15:10
can kind of see all the stuff then I
15:13
have my kind of go to other pins besides
15:17
the arty so this is a little bit of a
15:20
variety so this is a villa beautiful pen
15:23
I love these pins the only complaint I
15:25
have about these and I've talked about
15:26
this before is that they don't post
15:29
so because of the way the cap fits on
15:33
the back of this pin you could be
15:35
writing for a while and it's just gonna
15:36
fly off and that's my only complaint but
15:39
they're so beautiful and I love the way
15:40
they write that I just usually don't
15:42
post it and I'll just put the cap out
15:44
here
15:44
but they're so so pretty this one I
15:46
think is called Cherry Bomb I love it
15:49
it's so beautiful
15:50
then I also have one of my favorite
15:53
types of felt-tip pens are the mono
15:57
tombow mono drawing pin so this is the O
15:59
5 and I just love writing with it this
16:02
was when I used to bullet journal these
16:04
were the kinds of pens I liked to use
16:05
the most
16:06
the felt-tip ones and these tombow mono
16:09
drawing pins are some of the best and
16:11
you can get them in a pack with
16:12
different tip sizes then I have also the
16:16
point three eight of the Muji black gel
16:18
pen I also have this Kirito --ga 0.05 or
16:25
0.5 pencil so this is a My Melody one
16:29
they have an entire Sanrio collection so
16:31
of course I have the Hello Kitty one as
16:33
well and of course you can pull this tip
16:35
off and you've got a little eraser and
16:38
this one you can't you know some of them
16:41
you can like shake but this one's not a
16:43
shaker you have to actually push it down
16:45
but I like the way these write I like
16:47
the way they feel in my hand and they're
16:49
pretty so if I'm going to be writing out
16:52
plot stuff like when I journal I usually
16:54
use my pen but if I'm gonna be working
16:55
on a story's plot which is what I often
16:58
I'm doing when I'm out writing I will
17:00
use pencil because I'm like I said I'm
17:03
not always ready to commit to something
17:05
so that's why I have the pencil stuff in
17:08
here
17:08
then this is a newer to me pen this is I
17:12
actually have a Yuna style fit multi pen
17:15
but this is a new body pen body for me
17:18
that I just recently got so you can see
17:20
here that you can put five different
17:23
colors into this one I think they have
17:24
some that are like one two three four
17:27
and five maybe they have a six as well
17:29
I'm not sure so you just press down and
17:33
you have the color that you want and I
17:37
have it with pink green grayish black a
17:41
blueish black purple
17:43
and that's it so these I like pretty
17:46
well because I've got the fine tip in
17:48
here as well I think I have the point
17:49
3/8 in here I can't see it on the inside
17:53
I could probably take it apart but it
17:55
also has an eraser here because you can
17:58
put a pencil lead in one of those but I
18:01
haven't really done that this one opens
18:03
with the barrel like this so yep 0.38 so
18:07
these are the 0.38 ones which I always
18:10
like a really fine tip pen and I feel
18:13
like in the stores they mostly sell
18:15
point 7s and I'm like no because I like
18:17
the point threes the point 5 stuff like
18:19
that so I prefer fine tip pen then the
18:22
final thing I have in here is some zebra
18:26
mild liners and you probably can start
18:28
to notice a color preference that I've
18:30
had lately this like teal and pink or
18:32
purplish color is sort of my favorite
18:35
colors for the past several years
18:36
they're just my go-to colors so those
18:39
are the two zebra mild liners that I
18:40
have in here and these also have a
18:43
double point so you've got the bold side
18:46
of the highlighter that's a thicker one
18:48
and then on the other side you have
18:49
little one so a lot of times if I'm
18:52
doing plotting stuff I will use the
18:55
little side of the mild liner to create
18:58
little dots or I'll use this stencil
19:02
here the Hoban ichi stencil to make
19:06
these little squares with it sometimes 2
19:08
or I'll use the little circle one if I
19:10
want them to be really exact so that is
19:13
what I have in my pin case or pencil
19:15
case as a writer this is typically what
19:18
I take with me and I have had if you
19:20
guys watched my pouch video that I just
19:22
did I have had in the past much bigger
19:25
ones that I could fit a lot more pens
19:27
but then what I find is if I'm just
19:29
going out writing to Barnes & Noble or
19:31
somewhere like that I don't use half of
19:33
the Pens that I take with me and I end
19:34
up spending a lot of time kind of
19:35
digging through looking for them so
19:37
typically what I've been doing lately is
19:39
making sure that I at least have
19:41
anything I need for color coding which
19:43
these pens pretty much solve that
19:45
problem and you know all the little
19:48
tools that I need like the whiteout or
19:50
the ruler and that sort
19:52
so this is what's in my pin case let me
19:55
know if you enjoyed this video I hope
19:57
that you did if you did I would love for
19:59

20:13
if you are a writer or you study or
20:16
whatever you do and you take a packed up
20:18
pen case with you if there's anything
20:20
that you find that's a must-have for you
20:23
that I don't have included in here that
20:25
you think I should take with me or that
20:27
I would benefit from I'm always looking
20:29
for more ideas of what might be useful
20:31
when I'm out but for now this is what I
20:35
tend to take with me so I'm going to
20:36
just pack it back up
20:38
[Music]
20:49

20:56
bye
okay it's time to get real we have got to get real mental health let's talk
0:07
about it [Music]
0:13
before we get started with the heart of today's video I wanted to say a special thank you to Rose forever New York for
0:21
sending these gorgeous roses I am so in love with these roses I cannot tell you
0:26
how much of a difference even something simple like this that's beautiful in your office can make when it comes to
0:33
your mental health this one is in a beautiful acrylic box that you can put your washi tape and supplies in so it
0:40
has a special place on my desk if you remember they sent me some roses earlier this year I think it's been six
0:47
months and look how beautiful these still are they stay good for up to a year but I'm feeling like they're gonna
0:54
stay good even longer so we'll talk more about this a little bit later in the video big projects like nanowrimo or big
Why Mental Health Suffers During Deadlines
1:01
goals that we set can be so fun and rewarding there's no doubt we can push ourselves to a new level we can level up
1:09
we can achieve things we never thought possible for ourselves so in a lot of ways aiming for those big audacious
1:16
goals is a huge part of what gets us to our dream life however there are a few
1:23
reasons why this type of thing like a deadline a big goal something that you're really reaching for or pushing
1:30
yourself toward can be dangerous and one of them is that often we get so focused on the end result and the outcome that
1:39
we attach a certain kind of meaning to it and we say okay I gotta be perfect first of all also we got that
1:44
perfectionism raise your hand in the comments if this is you and that sounds familiar I gotta do it perfectly or I'm
1:51
a failure and that's really the piece of it is that we attach meaning to not quite
1:57
hitting the goal in the time frame that we expected so I set out a pre-order I
2:02
don't get the book finished in time I'm a failure I don't reach my goal of 10
2:08
000 subscribers by the end of the year I'm a failure and we are the ones who
2:13
put that pressure on ourselves whereas the truth is okay so maybe you don't hit the 10 000 by the end of the year but
2:18
maybe you hit it in January or February or maybe it takes you another year but you eventually will get there as long as
2:24
you don't give up so I think that where it becomes dangerous is that we often assign this word failure or we assign
2:32
some other kind of meaning to goals and heavy deadlines or projects that we say if I don't perform perfectly then I am
2:40
this kind of person and when we attach our self-worth to that goal and that outcome or we attach our value in this
2:47
world to it we are putting our mental health in danger so that's one of the things I told you we're getting real
2:53
today and that is one of the most real things I can tell you because I have struggled with this for decades the
2:59
other reason it can be dangerous is because we get so hyper focused on this
3:04
piece of the puzzle the goal the outcome I gotta do everything I can to get there that we often sometimes sacrifice some
3:11
of the tools and things that we need because they seem Superfluous like I don't really need as much sleep because
3:17
I'm trying to hit this goal I don't really need as much time with my family this month or this year because I'm so
3:23
focused on this goal I gotta get the goal let's do this and it's like that energy you know it can be great
3:29
sometimes to sort of sacrifice a few things to hit your goals like finishing
3:35
projects there are probably lots of projects and cars and technology and computers and
3:41
probably lots of things that wouldn't exist if some certain group of people weren't willing to say okay I'm gonna
3:47
you know put my blinders on and I'm gonna focus on this so it's not all bad but we have to be taking care of our
3:53
mental health along the way or we're gonna hit that goal someday or we're gonna fall short and we're gonna look
3:59
around to find that our life has burned to the ground while we weren't paying attention
4:07
the flip side of that is that we can also feel guilty sometimes that we are taking all this time for ourselves that
4:13
we say oh my gosh I've got to carve out this time for writing or this time that I'm working on this new business or this new idea and so all the other people in
4:21
my life like my kids my parents my husband whoever needs things from you they don't get as much of your time so
4:27
then when you're done with your high like high level thinking hard work get out of your office or out of your
4:34
workspace and even though you may need a little bit of downtime some meditation
4:39
some me time some reading some sitting outside time everybody is immediately like hey I need this I need this I need
4:45
this and it's one of those things about your role in your life that we can often
4:50
feel guilty for taking even more time but the truth is to get the project done
4:55
we can't just work work work on the project and then step outside of our project and then do do like give give to
5:02
everybody else we have to still be taking care of ourselves and our writing time though fun and is not always that
5:09
sort of self-care time so that is sort of the Baseline of the real talk and
5:14
what we're going to do from now until the end of this video is I'm gonna give you six ways that you can try to really
5:20
take care of your mental health six mindset shifts that can really help you as you're trying to achieve any Big Goal
5:28
where you have to really focus in on your time including nanowrimo now of course this will be our final preptober
5:34
video so I wanted to record it in the spooky room because I will be taking all of this down which you will see in the
5:40
nanowrimo Diaries which will start next week so if you're looking forward to 30 days of Vlogs as I attempt to write 50
5:47
000 words next month make sure you're subscribed because it's always an adventure we also have a live q a coming
5:53
up this Sunday with some of my heart breathing's writing Community admins so that's going to be super fun I will put
5:59
all the links in the description box below all the details in this description box below okay first things
Give yourself breathing room
6:05
first number one do not pack your schedule so tight that you just feel
6:12
like you want to cry because you have zero time to like rest and recover your mind of course I have been talking
6:18
throughout preptober about how to create space in your schedule and that means things like planning out your meals or
6:24
planning out a uniform for yourself or whatever you need to do to get that writing time in however if you take a
6:32
calendar and you just schedule yourself out every single slot from the moment you wake up until the moment you go to
6:38
bed and you don't actually have any blank space in there where you can just do whatever you feel like today you're
6:44
probably going to be exhausted about 10 days in if you can make it that far so my advice to you is if you can go back
6:52
to the drawing board of your schedule from week to week to week you can find the little planner pages in my preptober
6:57
workbook or you can use your own planner but just trying to figure out when like
7:03
do you have little blocks of space in your schedule that you can just fill in
7:08
as you go that aren't like already committed now for some of you you may be so busy and so committed to all your
7:15
responsibilities that there's not going to be a lot of time so maybe one thing you would want to do is come up with a
7:21
list of things that you can do that only take you five or ten minutes but that feel like a break to you so this is just
7:28
laying on your back on the floor and listening to a full song of music or going outside for just 10 minutes and
7:35
reading half of a chapter or putting your earbuds in like maybe you got to clean maybe you got stuff you need to do
7:40
but put your earbuds in and listen to some really soft like music or stuff that makes you happy whatever calms you
7:47
or makes you feel better then it can feel like a break even though you're cleaning right or take a little Drive in
7:53
the car go get those groceries whatever and crank the music up but find ways to make sure that you have a little bit of
7:59
blank space in your schedule that you can just really unplug and do something
8:05
for yourself because if you are already struggling like right now in October
8:10
you're already struggling feeling overwhelmed feeling like you don't have time to do it all if you pack your
8:15
schedule full of even more things in the month of November you're setting yourself up for a very
8:20
dangerous mental health scenario so I highly recommend that you create a little bit of blank space in your
8:26
schedule in order to you know give yourself that time to decompress and take care of your mental health number
Define success for yourself
8:32
two remember that you actually get to define success for yourself like okay
8:39
nanowrimo for example says 50 000 words in 30 days but they are not the boss of your life
8:45
these are just fun guidelines to try to get writers to write no one's going to come to your house and be like you have
8:51
failed because you only got 45 000 words like it just doesn't work like that and in most areas of your life you have the
8:58
power to decide what success looks like when it comes to your career your income
9:04
your relationships you get to decide and when we live in this world where everybody's social media conscious and
9:10
we see everybody's highlight reels all the time it can be really difficult to go into ourselves and say I'm actually
9:17
really happy with my life the way that it is because often we see other people accomplishing things and we feel like I
9:23
have to do that too oh my gosh somebody completed Nano in six days what's wrong with me and we allow what other people
9:30
are accomplishing or what other people are prioritizing to mean something about
9:35
who we are as a person and this is the basis of so much damaged mental health
9:41
and anxiety and I'm not saying this says judgment because I am guilty as charged
9:46
I have struggled with comparisonitis I struggle sometimes with like wow how come they're writing six books a year I
9:53
can't do it but then when I turn around and look I realize I'm a massive success without writing
9:58
six books a year I don't have to be that person I don't have to live up to their best life I get to Define what is my
10:05
best life and maybe that's quieter on my book sales right now but it's blowing things up when it comes to my
10:12
relationship with my husband and how much less anxiety I have this year than last year Hallelujah last year was a
10:18
struggle you know and sometimes the outer world doesn't really know what you're going through so don't let those
10:24
people define success for you you get to choose what does success look like so
10:30
don't let 50 000 words in a prescripted 30 days if you aren't able to make it
10:36
Define who you are as a writer okay so it took you 45 days it took you 90. it's okay I think also this is a good place
10:44
to remember that you can adapt your goal like on the Nano website it's gonna say 50 000 words but you get a chance to say
10:51
you know what okay I thought I could do it the month get started because like life doesn't stop the bills are going to
10:58
keep coming kids are still going to need you you're going to have something come up at work or whatever your situation is like life doesn't pause and say okay
11:05
we're gonna let Sarah finish Nano and then we'll throw the kitchen sink at her it just continues on and so we have to
11:11
come into Nano as we are with our regular old life and we have to find
11:17
ways to fit the writing in around that life and sometimes there's just going to be circumstances like me last year
11:24
during Nano when I was struggling more than I can possibly explain to anybody and I know some of you felt that in my
11:29
energy I did my best to keep myself going but it was really hard for me and so towards
11:36
the middle of the month or into the month I decided okay success for me this year is not going to be 50k that is out
11:42
of my reach and it doesn't mean I'm a bad person or a bad writer or a failure it doesn't mean anything it just means
11:48
my life is busy and I have high anxiety right now so I set a different goal okay 25 000 is success for me and I know that
11:56
that can sometimes be difficult because we feel like no we gotta hit the goal but I just want to empower You by saying
12:03
you do get to choose so Define your success for yourself and adapt as needed it's okay number three fill your life
Fill life with simple pleasures
12:11
with Simple Pleasures so this can be simple things like really making your
12:16
room or your space that you get to write into something that feels really good buying those writing gloves that you
12:22
guys saw me put in that little writing caddy that is just a simple pleasure having my fridge filled with flavored
12:29
sparkling water is just a simple pleasure but it's something easy I can do when they were having a sale so I
12:35
stocked up my whole pantry and it brings me so much joy even though it's such a simple thing taking a bath going outside
12:41
and watching the Texas sunsets which are just stunning it doesn't cost me
12:46
anything but man does it just make me feel so good so I try to hit that Sunset I try to see it every single night and
12:53
it's only 10 minutes but it's a simple pleasure a simple joy so I'm gonna share with you real quick we're gonna go back
12:59
to those Roses in the other room because this is an example of you know setting
13:04
my room up the way that I want surrounding myself with color and beauty and placing something on my desk like a
13:11
mug or some roses in an acrylic box like I can't even explain how much joy that
13:17
brings to me so you guys saw that I featured these roses earlier in the year and I just
13:23
want to show you again how beautiful they look even after all this time Rose
13:28
forever New York sent this to me they started in 2019 and they have these
13:34
gorgeous luxurious Rose boxes and the ones I showed you before are these beautiful vegan sort of velvet material
13:41
but they also have these gorgeous acrylic boxes and these to me are just
13:46
so stunning these are natural roses that have been preserved with natural oils
13:53
and the bouquets are handcrafted and selected by professional flower Artisans and all of the materials that you see in
14:00
all of the boxes is is vegan and everything that's preserved is done so with a natural process of pigmentation
14:07
they have gorgeous colors like violet and black and royal blue so this is done
14:12
through a natural process of pigmentation and they keep that same Rich intensive shade and their allergen
14:18
for free so go and check out all of the beautiful different colors and design
14:24
options just it's just incredible but this month in particular we are almost
14:29
to the end of October but Rose forever New York is joining breast cancer awareness months Global campaign
14:36
dedicated to raising awareness about breast cancer and supporting women to reduce breast cancer risks so because of
14:42
this they have lowered all their prices on their pink roses and they're offering special discounts and free shipping and
14:49
for every pink bouquet sold they will donate two dollars to breast cancer research so let's spread the word on it
14:55
Go treat yourself to something beautiful or get get these as a reward for yourself I also have a special code that
15:02
they sent me which gives you even more off than I was able to give you last time so if you use the code sarah25
15:08
remember it's s-a-r-r-a 25 you'll get 25 off your order so thank you so much for
15:14
Rose forever these are just beautiful and it's just another way to in indulge in a simple pleasure something that
15:20
makes you feel nice on that same token keeping your space clean can be super
15:26
awesome when it comes to it now I am somebody who's guilty you guys have seen it over and over again I'm sorry to say
15:32
that when I'm on Deadline I tend to let my room get messy and my space get messy like my makeup will be all over the
15:38
counter I've got clothes on the floor there's planners all over the floor like just throwing papers everywhere but I am
15:47
trying this year in this new house to be more organized and keep things a little bit tidier and it is helping so
15:54
indulging in The Simple Pleasures keeping your space nice so that you feel grounded and you feel like every time
16:00
you walk into a room it brings you Joy rather than making you feel like you're behind on everything that is one of the
16:07
keys to taking care of your mental health during a deadline I'm also going to add number four here is to remember
Remember you’re not alone
16:12
that you're not alone so this goes for help if you have trouble keeping your
16:18
your house tidy or the dishes are getting over you know over the sink there are hopefully people in your house
16:24
that can help you or you can even like go out and order out food a little bit more often if you need to just like if
16:31
you're hitting a point like order food and go pick it up rather than cooking but asking for help from your friends
16:37
from the people that live in your home that can be super helpful but also remembering that you're not alone in
16:43
this community of writers so we have of course the hearties on this channel we're going to be getting together
16:48
literally every day in November with my Vlogs to kind of talk about how things
16:53
are going but we also have the heart breathing's writing Community which is over 5 000 authors now
16:58
that get together literally every day to write obviously not everybody on every stream but we have a steady like 10 to
17:05
30 people almost every single sprinting session so you can always go to the
17:11
heartbreakings writing Community page over on my website and you can get that Google Calendar that has a list of times
17:16
and Links of all the people that are going live and it can be so helpful when you're starting to get into that darker
17:22
place or you're starting to feel like you're the only one struggling it can be so helpful to reach out to that
17:28
community and say I'm really struggling today I can't get my word count I need a little bit of encouragement and I
17:34
guarantee you people will lift you up because this is such an amazing Community my Discord server is available
17:40
to you as well it is called Sarah Cannon's coven because it was created for fans of my books but we do have a
17:46
thriving small community of Nano participants and heart breathings uh hearties and so you're welcome to come
17:52
join that writer's channels and come hang out and of course always welcome to read my books as well and become a fan
17:58
of the those there are so many resources and whether you're doing Nano or you're just alone on a deadline there are
18:05
people out there who have been through what you've been through like part of the reason I joined Amber McHugh's modern CEO group and now her accelerate
18:12
group that I talked about earlier in this year is because I have that Community where on Boxer together we
18:17
chat every day if I have a down day I have those people to reach out to and I want you to know that those resources
18:23
are available to you as well all you have to do is just reach out and come join us and I promise you you will find
18:29
people that will be nice to you that will lift you up and will cheer you on number five lean into your self-care
Lean into your self-care rituals and tools
18:37
rituals whatever that looks like to you for me it's often time outside is the
18:43
time I get to read and relax it also my time like every single night I sit in
18:49
the bed for about 20 minutes and read my tarot card and I journal and I talk to my husband and I sometimes will make
18:55
popcorn and you know have a glass of wine that's sometimes like the self-care that I needed was just like turning on
19:02
some planner plan with me YouTube videos and just relaxing sometimes I need that
19:08
moment and like I was saying in the intro to this video sometimes when we're on Deadline we kind of shy away from
19:15
those times to ourselves because we've already been so selfish and taking all this time to write but the truth is we
19:22
need to lean into those rituals even more than ever before so sometimes it
19:28
can just be a nice candle it can be a bubble bath it can be time with friends it could be just taking the time to go
19:34
out to a coffee shop but just leaning into whatever are your personal self-care rituals be it journaling or
19:41
whatever it may be and not abandoning them just because you're so busy Now's the Time to make sure that you almost
19:48
like make an appointment for yourself to get those things done or to spend time on things that bring you Joy as kind of
19:54
a sub point to that part of what I would encourage you to do that's been helpful for me is checking in with myself like
20:02
one of my self-care rituals every single morning is to pull out my six months for life journal which is just a program
20:07
that I am doing for myself I created it but it's not like an official program but it's for the past several months as
20:14
I've been doing a six month sort of level up for myself I sit down every single morning when I'm having my coffee
20:21
and I check in with how I'm feeling and how I'm doing am I overwhelmed am I feeling good am I feeling like what am I
20:27
grateful for and I check in and that's really when I'm able to instead of going through the motions I sort of stop
20:33
myself and say hey how's it really going as if I were my own best friend and that
20:39
is sometimes the time when I say you know what I am completely losing it I've been crying I've been struggling I have
20:47
not been working on my story I'm really disappointed in myself then I can kind of come around and say okay what do you
20:52
need and it's like a conversation between my self and my higher self what
20:58
do you need what can I do for you how can I support you today and sometimes the answer is you know what I think I'm
21:03
just going to take my story and I'm going to run to the coffee shop for a couple hours or you know what this video
21:09
is just gonna be delayed and I'm gonna spend time snuggled up with my daughter or playing with her ponies and that's
21:15
gonna be it not real ponies just like my little ponies but maybe I'm gonna sit down with my son and we're gonna read a
21:21
few chapters or something or I'm going to help him with his homework and we're just going to cuddle on the couch and maybe I wouldn't have normally taken
21:27
time to do that or to lean into those extra self-care rituals or to say let's do a date night
21:33
because I didn't want to take the time or because I'm just going through the motions but when you stop and you take
21:39
some kind of awareness of where you are in your mental health right now like if
21:45
you're kind of on the edge but you're not admitting it to yourself because you're so stinking busy then you could
21:50
continue to push yourself and not take the break and eventually you're just gonna fall off the cliff right but if
21:56
you're kind of on the edge and you check in with yourself and you have that awareness and you have that sort of ritual of checking in with yourself you
22:02
might say okay deep breaths I need to meditate go get my nails done and go for a walk you know
22:09
and now you bring yourself back to a Baseline and maybe you had a couple days where you didn't get any words in but in
22:16
my opinion that is so much better to take the time you need to get yourself in a good mental place and not get words
22:21
for a couple days than to try to push yourself and then you completely give up on Nano because you've fallen off the
22:28
edge of anxiety so preventative self-care is checking in with yourself
22:33
every day and thinking of your own needs my sixth and final tip to you is to
Be your own biggest cheerleader
22:38
really learn to be your own biggest cheerleader I have talked about this before that my
22:44
husband sort of identified early on in our relationship that I kind of have two
22:49
sides to myself like two voices that are always talking in my head and one of them is ass kicker sweetie and she is
22:56
the one who's like yes I'm gonna get it I can do this you're so good Sarah you're doing such a great job like
23:02
people love your books this is going great hoorah like sit down and get it done but then there's also evil sweetie
23:08
on this side an evil sweetie is that voice that's always putting meaning to
23:15
my shortcomings like if I don't hit the 50 000 you know Sarah over here is going to be
23:22
like whoa you you still did 25 like you sat down you developed a writing habit
23:27
this is really good she sees that positive side of what I have accomplished and what I've made my way through and if I didn't do my best she's
23:34
still there to say you know what get back up you you have learned something you've learned more about yourself let's
23:40
learn from it and let's move on to the next goal like let's set another goal let's get it going
23:45
whereas evil sweetie is the one over here going you can't even write twenty thousand words in a month how do you
23:51
think you're ever going to be the best writer like how do you think you're going to compare to these other people your whole career is running down the
23:56
drain and you're just gonna let it go like you're the worst person and I could just go on and on with that voice and
24:02
for some of you that type of voice is very familiar for me it's like a trauma
24:07
response a trauma voice from my past and it has taken me a long time to learn to
24:13
say oh I recognize that voice I am an observer of that voice that is not a
24:18
true voice that is not who I really am that's just a thought that I've been conditioned and trained to think or that
24:25
I heard so often I started to believe it but it is not the truth and so if you
24:30
can learn to recognize that negative voice that comes into your head that tells you people are mad at you people
24:37
don't care about you you're all alone you're not doing a good enough job you didn't try hard enough you're never
24:43
gonna do it you're never gonna be good enough you're too old like any of those kind of negative thoughts that keep
24:48
coming up for you you're running out of time um all those things that make you feel anxiety
24:54
that voice is not true I promise you it is not telling you the
24:59
truth and all it's doing is telling you these things that it thinks will keep you safe and if you can learn to
25:06
recognize that voice and say that's not true if it says you're too old to get
25:12
started you're running out of time you can't even write 20 000 words in a month which makes you think you're ever going to be a writer try to reframe it and
25:19
turn it around and say you know what I'm really proud of myself for being 50 years old and finally going after my
25:25
dreams it took me long enough I am so I'm not gonna waste another minute I am so excited and I have made really good
25:31
progress and I cannot wait to sit down and write and instantly that shifts your energy from being a victim being sorry
25:38
for yourself feeling hopeless to hey I actually am accomplishing really good things so if you can kind of create for
25:45
yourself your own booty kicker you know Persona that is always going to cheer
25:50
you up and bring you back I'm not talking about toxic positivity where it's like you can do it ignore your
25:56
feelings that's not all what I'm talking about I'm just talking about when we're alone with our thoughts and we fall
26:02
short of a goal or we even when we're proud of ourselves sometimes that voice will come up and it will tell us things
26:08
that are trying to keep us small and if you can learn to recognize that voice and counteract it with really cheering
26:15
yourself on as if you were speaking to your best friend oh my gosh but look how far you've come you're doing such a
26:22
great job and I think that that can make such a difference in your mental health for the month and if you combine all
26:29
those things and you really start keeping up with your space you surround yourself with simple Joys and you check
26:36
in on your mental health you create that white space and you don't push yourself to the Limit and then you're also like
26:42
championing yourself like hey I actually wrote a thousand words today instead of I only wrote a thousand words today or
26:48
I'm a failure and making these shortcomings mean something about who you are and instead saying I tried I'm
26:54
doing my best job I'm showing up every day and I'm really proud of that being proud of yourself when you rest
26:59
being proud of yourself when you have a reward that you earned and not comparing yourself to other people but really
27:05
sitting and thinking about your own success and defining that for yourself wow that's going to be so powerful and
27:12
these are things I'm still reminding myself of too I have not learned to do it perfectly but I have come so far
27:19
since this time last year I have learned so much about myself and I can feel my
27:25
energy completely shifting and I I want to stay on that path and I want that path for you too so let's be our own big
27:31
cheerleaders and let's have an amazing month ahead for nanowrimo remember that we do have our live q a coming up at 3
27:38
P.M on Sunday with some special guests so that's going to be awesome I also will be putting up a little
27:44
questionnaire like a question box over on my Instagram at heartbreathings for if you want to submit questions in
27:50
advance and then we will be taking some questions live it's going to be super fun it'll run for about an hour I also
27:56
wanted to just briefly let you know that until tomorrow I do have an order form open because I've been celebrating my 12
28:03
year anniversary as an indie author because my book birthday for my first book is coming up on Saturday so I
28:09
offered all of my backlist paperbacks signed so if you are also a fan of my
28:14
books or you've always wanted to try them out and you would like a signed copy of one of my books I will pop that
28:19
order form in the description for you below I'm going to be signing like 500 plus books in November so I will share
28:25
that virtual signing experience with you guys during Nano it's going to be super fun but I hope that you've enjoyed this
28:31
video go pick out some roses for yourself or do something really nice for yourself but if I have to leave you with
28:37
one thought it is just that you are good and worthy despite the goals that you
28:44
reach for and the things that you do just in your heart you are inherently worthy and talented and you have a voice
28:50
that deserves to be heard and the rest of it is just timing as long as you
28:55
don't give up those goals can still be yours 30 days shreddy days like it's
29:01
okay if you don't hit it in 30 days or if you miss the pre-order or if you fall short of the timing of your goals maybe
29:07
there was a reason why that timing needed to be shifted so learn to trust
29:14
yourself learn to trust the timing of your life and cheer yourself on because
29:19
you deserve it and you don't have to hit 50 000 words in a month or hit a certain
29:26
sales number or reach a project deadline or make a hundred thousand dollars a year to be good and so often our society
29:34
kind of tells us that that's the way it is but none of that is true you get to define success for yourself and the more
29:40
you can learn to do that and really lean into it I think the happier you will be that has certainly been the truth for me
29:46
and I hope it is the truth for you so here's the two wonderful mental health for all of us here's to community and
29:52

Sunday for our live q a bye [Music]

hey guys welcome back to heart
0:02
breathing's we have been discussing how
0:05
to plot your novel and now that we are
0:07
all the way at the end I thought I would
0:09
just add one more video to discuss what
0:13
happens if you get stuck now trust me
0:19
when I say that there have been so many
0:22
times in my career that I have had this
0:24
very beautiful plot outline and
0:26
everything seems like it's going great
0:28
and it's the story is just gonna
0:30
practically write itself because it's so
0:31
wonderfully done and then I'll get you
0:34
know ten twenty thousand words into it
0:36
well into the second act or whatever and
0:38
suddenly my characters aren't doing what
0:41
I thought they were going to do
0:42
something in the story is stuck and
0:45
sometimes when this happens I will spend
0:48
weeks trying to get back on track
0:49
because I had this great outline and now
0:51
it's not working so I wanted to just
0:54
give you a few tips and tricks that I
0:56
have learned and things that have worked
0:57
for me along the way when I'm thinking
0:59
about how to get the story moving again
1:01
when something is just stuck or
1:03
something in my outline is not working
1:05
okay so one of the things that I love to
1:08
do and this is probably one of the most
1:09
helpful things for me is I like to talk
TALK IT OUT
1:12
it out with a friend or with my husband
1:14
just talking it out even if that person
1:17
doesn't honestly give a lot of feedback
1:20
or a lot of great ideas just somehow
1:22
getting out of my head and getting words
1:25
out where I'm like oh this that this you
1:27
know like I remember being at a writing
1:29
retreat with my friend Bella not that
1:31
long ago and I was trying to work
1:33
through a story plot point and it was
1:36
just like oh I couldn't get I couldn't
1:38
get it and I was like writing things
1:39
down and trying and trying trying and
1:41
then I just sat down with a cup of
1:43
coffee with her and I said well maybe
1:44
what needs to happen is blah blah blah
1:46
blah blah and it was like everything
1:48
just fell together and all I needed was
1:50
to be able to verbalize it and get it
1:52
out of my head and into you know speech
1:55
and for some reason that process just
1:57
got things moving again so when you
1:59
start to feel stuck and you're just not
2:01
sure where to go next
2:03
try talking it out with a friend another
2:04
technique that I often use is I will
2:07
create a new doc and I'll just call it
2:08
something like deceiving darkness
2:10
thoughts and all I will do is just start
WRITING BRAINSTORM
2:13
typing like purely
2:14
stream-of-consciousness like I know
2:16
Harper's have gone here and here but
2:18
what if she did this or what if she did
2:20
this and what I'm really thinking is
2:22
this and somehow I think that sometimes
2:24
when I'm just sitting down and trying to
2:26
make the story come together in my head
2:27
and all I'm doing is just imagining it
2:30
feels really stuck so I need action so
2:33
whether it's talking it out with someone
2:35
else or sort of typing and talking it
2:37
out just to myself sometimes that can
2:40
help so starting a new document and just
2:42
start nothing that's gonna go into your
2:43
word count or anything like that but
2:45
just something that you're thinking out
2:47
on paper stream-of-consciousness
2:50
you can hand write it or you can type it
2:52
out but sometimes just sort of word
2:54
vomiting onto a page of what could
2:56
happen what might happen what your
2:58
thoughts are what's not working
2:59
sometimes that can really help also
3:01
sometimes it helps to not just get
3:03
active mentally but also physically
3:06
going for a walk taking a break from
OO FOR A WALK OR A DRIVE
3:08
just staring at the blank page for a
3:11
while and walk around the mall walk in
3:13
the beach walk down around your
3:15
neighborhood get on the treadmill
3:16
whatever it is you can do easily get
3:19
your body moving because sometimes like
3:21
doing something like that
3:22
sometimes I even won't go for a drive
3:24
because keeping my sort of that one side
3:27
of my mind occupied taking a shower
3:30
sometimes the best ideas come when I'm
3:31
taking a shower or going for a walk
3:33
something like that just getting your
3:35
body out of the chair and into another
3:38
environment where you can open up your
3:40
brain to start working I have a friend
3:43
who does puzzles a lot of times when she
3:45
starts to get stuck because she's good
3:47
enough at puzzles that they don't occupy
3:49
enough of her brain space it's just kind
3:51
of like going through the motion of the
3:53
puzzle while she's working through those
3:55
mental puzzles the story puzzles in her
3:58
brain that doesn't work for me because I
4:00
am not good enough at actual puzzles so
4:02
I have to really focus on them sometimes
4:04
for me what works is even binging like
4:07
binge watching something on Netflix or
4:08
YouTube because I know I'm working out
4:10
that story problem somewhere in the back
4:13
of my subconscious but I do find one of
4:17
the number one things that helps is
4:18
actually getting up and going for a walk
4:20
and really just allowing my body to move
4:23
while I'm thinking through the story
4:24
problem another tactic I like
4:26
to do is almost like meditative or turnt
4:29
getting into a trance I like to sit down
MEDITATE
4:31
somewhere really just take some deep
4:33
breaths and start daydreaming about
4:35
where the story could go as if it was a
4:37
movie playing in my head and sometimes
4:40
it's like if I play the movie up to what
4:42
has already happened so far in my draft
4:45
then I can suddenly begin to imagine new
4:49
scenes and whenever I have an idea for a
4:52
new scene even if it's not completely an
4:54
order of what should come next I will
4:56
write down that idea because a lot of
4:58
times when I get into a sort of
5:00
meditation where I'm fully immersed like
5:02
no phone no distractions no noise
5:04
just deep breathing and really thinking
5:07
about that character and what's going on
5:09
in the story then it will allow me to
5:11
sort of open up this creativity where I
5:13
can start to envision scenes and like I
5:16
said it doesn't always tell me like
5:17
here's what happens next but it might
5:19
give me a flash of like Harper going
5:24
into this room or finding this building
5:26
or you know something that she's doing
5:29
and I can see her almost like a movie
5:31
going into this place and something's
5:34
happening and so I'll write that down
5:35
and when I start to come out of that
5:38
meditation there will be all these ideas
5:40
and I can sometimes even start to write
5:43
the story out of order that really helps
5:45
for me I know it doesn't help for some
5:46
people they just can't do that or they
5:48
don't enjoy doing that but if I see that
5:50
scene if I if I'm stuck over here like
5:53
an Act one I'll jump ahead I have no
5:55
problem jumping ahead to the end of Act
5:57
two to get that scene on paper because
5:59
sometimes just getting the words flowing
6:02
again will help me figure out what was
6:04
stuck back in act 1 so I go into kind of
6:08
what I would call a meditation or a
6:09
trance where I'm imagining my story
6:11
flowing through me as if it were a movie
6:14
and whatever scenes pop up there's no
6:17
judgement there's no nothing it's just
6:18
if it's a scene that pops up I write it
6:20
down and when I come out of that state I
6:23
either start to actually write that
6:25
scene or I start to put it together just
6:29
like a puzzle piece and say where could
6:30
that scene fit in if that scene happens
6:32
does that change anything about where I
6:34
was stuck that sort of thing hopefully
6:36
that makes sense another tactic that I
6:38
use often is to go back to the care
6:40
to themselves and do a an interview with
6:43
them so like I might just sort of start
INTERVIEW YOUR CHARACTERS
6:45
typing out you know as if I were someone
6:48
interviewing Harper Harper why in the
6:50
world are you stuck on this story thing
6:52
why won't you do this thing I asked you
6:53
to do and just free-flowing her answer
6:56
so if if I wanted her to I mean this is
6:59
totally just made up but let's say I
7:01
wanted her to go into a warehouse and
7:03
investigate a strange sound or some clue
7:06
that she found but I'm just not able to
7:08
get her there something isn't working
7:10
right so I'll say Harper why don't you
7:12
want to go into that warehouse and then
7:14
I'll start sort of role-playing as if I
7:16
were Harper and start thinking through
7:18
and somehow that will unlock something
7:20
in the back of my mind that I knew was
7:22
off about the story so maybe Harper will
7:24
respond and say Sarah you know I'm not
7:26
gonna go into that warehouse because
7:28
remember in book three when I did
7:29
such-and-such and it led to this
7:31
horrible thing I'm not gonna go do that
7:33
because that's the dumbest thing I could
7:34
possibly do if I got this information
7:36
about the warehouse what I really would
7:38
do is XYZ and that will start to make me
7:41
say like okay so that's why she doesn't
7:43
want to do this this was stupid of me or
7:46
this was definitely the wrong direction
7:47
for me to think she would do it after
7:49
she's already been in a similar
7:50
situation or whatever hopefully that
7:52
makes sense but it's just interviewing
7:54
that character and going back to their
7:56
mind and why they may not be like fully
7:59
down with the story that you plotted out
8:02
can sometimes help get things moving
8:04
again okay another tactic that I
8:06
sometimes use is to write out a list
8:08
just a total brainstorm of everything
8:11
that could still happen in the story so
8:13
even if it seems ridiculous Harper goes
BRAINSTORM A LIST OF POSSIBLE SCENES
8:15
to the moon Harper has an epiphany or
8:18
Harper has a vision or Harper decides to
8:20
go to the beach to relax and a monster
8:22
comes out of the sea I mean whatever it
8:24
is even if it's you're not writing
8:25
paranormal just let everything come out
8:28
of your brain say no judgment and set a
8:30
timer for 20 minutes I'm gonna write
8:32
down every possible idea of what could
8:34
happen next and when you just start
8:36
letting yourself go and say okay I'm
8:38
gonna let anything happen sometimes
8:40
that's where like magical things will
8:41
happen sure you might have written down
8:43
15 things and 12 of them were absolutely
8:46
ridiculous but if three of them start to
8:49
lead you down the path of where your
8:50
story really needs to go then it was a
8:52
valuable 15 minute
8:53
sir sighs I find it very valuable to
8:55
actually set a timer on this when I do
8:57
these brainstorms or otherwise I just
8:59
kind of tend to you know daydream and
9:01
let my mind wander so if I set that
9:02
timer like 5 10 20 minutes no longer
9:05
than 20 usually and say okay I'm gonna
9:08
take my pin and I'm gonna write down
9:09
every possible thing that could happen
9:11
next in this story and just go and let
9:14
this let the words flow just any little
9:16
thing with no judgment and I don't let
9:18
my pen stop moving usually some kind of
9:20
idea will come okay my final tip on what
9:23
to do if you get stuck in your story is
9:26
don't be afraid to go backward sometimes
9:28
I find that if a story just it seems on
GO BACK TO THE BEGINNING
9:31
paper like it should be working but the
9:33
words just won't flow then what I
9:35
inevitably come to realize is this
9:37
something I've already written just
9:39
isn't working and what hurts me more
9:43
than anything is not wanting to go back
9:45
and fix it because I don't want to waste
9:47
time rewriting and it ends up being kind
9:50
of a catch-22 because I don't want to
9:52
waste time rewriting but here I am
9:54
wasting time trying to figure out how to
9:56
start writing again so I always tell
9:59
myself don't be afraid to go back to the
10:02
beginning to say okay at the end of Act
10:04
one Harper goes into this warehouse and
10:07
this is what changes the whole story
10:08
what if she decides not to go in the
10:11
warehouse it's gonna change my entire
10:13
plot but what if I take that part out
10:15
sometimes it's the end of the story
10:17
maybe I haven't gotten there yet but I'm
10:19
thinking okay at the end of this story
10:21
there's gonna be X Y Z huge twist and so
10:24
I've been writing everything trying to
10:25
push to that ending so sometimes I have
10:28
to let go of what I thought would be
10:29
something really cool at the twist at
10:31
the end and say okay what if that's not
10:33
the ending what if I let go of that is
10:35
the ending what does that change so I
10:37
think sometimes you have to you you know
10:39
you've spent all this time plotting your
10:41
work you did all this really good
10:43
character work and getting every little
10:46
detail of the plot and every little
10:47
thing and it can be so hard to let go of
10:50
that and say okay I'm gonna let it go
10:51
and I'm gonna start from scratch but
10:53
sometimes that's what you need to do and
10:54
so don't look at the work you did before
10:57
as a waste of time choose instead to
10:59
look at as this was something that
11:01
unlocked my potential and the story
11:04
enough to make me get
11:06
this next the level no none of the work
11:09
that you do when you're plotting is a is
11:11
a waste of time unless you're just
11:12
literally doing nothing even if you have
11:14
to let go of something because the story
11:16
isn't working it was a stepping stone on
11:19
the path to the right story so don't be
11:21
afraid to go back and change things that
11:23
you really really thought would happen
11:25
and sometimes when I really look at my
11:27
plot and you know for some reason the
11:29
story is not coming together it won't
11:31
write it won't write and I can't figure
11:32
out what's wrong I have to go back and
11:34
look at the things that I thought were
11:36
absolutes like maybe the whole story was
11:40
plotted and I was like iffy on the
11:41
details but I knew at the midpoint X was
11:44
gonna happen sometimes holding on to
11:46
whatever that event was at the midpoint
11:48
is what's keeping the whole story from
11:50
flowing so I have to look go back and
11:53
look at and examine the things that I
11:55
thought were absolutely going into the
11:57
story because sometimes that's what's
11:59
holding it up and for some reason I
12:00
didn't want to let go of it because I
12:02
really liked that idea but the minute I
12:04
say okay fine she's not going to go into
12:07
this warehouse we're gonna cut that
12:09
whole part of the book what else could
12:11
happen that's when the story starts to
12:12
flow again so I guess the advice is
12:14
don't be afraid to let go of things that
12:17
you thought were certainties in your
12:19
story or in your story arc don't be
12:21
afraid to deviate from the plan the plan
12:24
is really just a way of getting you
12:27
started it's a way of organizing and
12:29
structuring your story but once you get
12:31
to writing it's gonna start to take on a
12:33
life of its own usually so when you get
12:35
stuck the only goal is to just keep
12:37
finding a way to keep going because the
12:40
worst thing that can happen is that you
12:42
you've done all this work on story
12:43
you've started the rough draft you're
12:45
going really good and then you get stuck
12:47
and you let yourself stop there it's
12:50
that absolute worst thing that could
12:51
happen now sometimes maybe you need a
12:52
few days to recalibrate to let your
12:55
brain think or you need some time to
12:56
rest because you've been working too
12:57
hard and that's totally fine don't let
12:59
yourself burn out but do not completely
13:02
abandon the story for weeks and months
13:04
on end just because you got stuck find a
13:07
way to get the mental energy going again
13:10
take a walk talk with a friend don't be
13:12
afraid to let go of plot points that you
13:14
thought were certainties interview your
13:16
character any of these tips that you
13:18
get to work to get things going again
13:20
and to get writing again is going to be
13:22
valuable and it will help you finish
13:24
your story quicker when you finish the
13:27
whole rough draft then you can always go
13:28
back and make sure that the structure
13:30
fits but if you get stuck don't get so
13:33
caught up in but I'm supposed to have an
13:35
attack here from the antagonist
13:37
don't let the story structure hold you
13:39
back if you feel intuitively after
13:42
you've got it structured that something
13:43
needs to change and that you need to go
13:45
in a different direction let your
13:46
creativity flow and let yourself explore
13:49
those things you can always go back and
13:51
make sure the pacing is right and the
13:53
story structure fits pretty well because
13:55
it's not it's more of a blueprint for
13:58
before you start your story or for you
14:00
know kind of making sure that you've
14:02
built the house in a way that is sturdy
14:04
but if you have to change things around
14:07
a little bit don't get so caught up in
14:08
the rules that you can't let go okay
14:10

hey everybody welcome back to heart
0:32
breathings
0:33
so as many of you may know i am
0:36
on deadline like major so i have a new
0:39
book
0:39
coming out on june 1st yay it is book 11
0:43
of my shadow demon saga and
0:45
as true to form as it is i am
0:48
still working through my edits so i have
0:50
about at this point eight days left
0:52
to edit the book before it has to go up
0:54
and i've got
0:56
chapters out with beta readers and all
0:57
kinds of things happening all at once
1:00
and sadly i have also just lost my
1:02
assistant so
1:03
things are super busy and heart
1:05
breathing's land right now we also are
1:07
building a house
1:08
and just had our pre-drywall meeting and
1:11
we're told we have 90 days to move which
1:13
i know sounds like a lot of time
1:15
but 90 days when i have so much going on
1:18
and it's gonna be summer and things are
1:21
busy and my son will be home from school
1:22
just feels a little bit overwhelming so
1:24
i thought i would take a little
1:26
bit of the overwhelm out of my schedule
1:27
and just do a kind of an old school plan
1:30
with me
1:31
so hopefully you guys enjoyed this and
1:33
this idea of kind of going back through
1:35
the way that i plan in my hb 90 planner
1:37
if you enjoy it please go ahead and hit
1:40
that thumbs up button down below the
1:42
like button and let me know in the
1:43
comments if you
1:44
enjoy seeing this kind of talk over plan
1:47
with me because this is kind of fun for
1:49
me too to show you how the planning goes
1:51
for me
1:52
so i am inside my a5 ring agenda from
1:56
erin condren but
1:57
those pages that come with the erin
1:59
condren don't actually start
2:01
until july so i set it up with as
2:04
always my hb 90 planner so this is a
2:06
goal-setting planner
2:08
for authors but really can be used for
2:10
any type of entrepreneur or for anybody
2:11
who's trying to set goals i have
2:14
some people that use it for just setting
2:16
goals with getting their house cleaned
2:17
up or losing weight or
2:20
you know just pretty much anything like
2:21
wanting to start a new business or
2:23
wanting to start writing for the first
2:24
time so
2:25
the first part of this planner that i'm
2:27
not showing you today it's like the
2:28
first 50 pages of the planner is really
2:30
a goal setting section where you set out
2:32
your goals for the quarter
2:33
but the pages that you see me working in
2:35
here are my actual weekly
2:38
planner pages and it's set out a little
2:40
different from most planners that you
2:41
might
2:42
have worked with in the past and this
2:44
idea for setting it up this way really
2:46
came
2:47
out of me getting frustrated with my
2:49
planners because i wasn't sticking to
2:51
them the way i wanted and i always ended
2:53
up using like extra pages and things
2:55
like that that got lost
2:56
and i sat down and really started
2:57
thinking okay what do i need
2:59
my planner to do for me and i like to
3:02
work in multiple stages so
3:04
what i am doing on this page this tasks
3:07
page is i have three main goals for the
3:09
quarter
3:10
and on this page every week i will sit
3:13
down
3:13
and decide what tasks i'm going to do
3:16
for this week
3:17
and that really helps me so i say goal
3:20
number one i've got to work on vengeful
3:21
darkness i have to finish writing my
3:23
blurb
3:24
i have to post a teaser and i want to
3:25
get 50 000 words edited
3:27
i'm also reading my book rival demons on
3:30
youtube
3:30
live so that's monday wednesday friday
3:33
and i've got that written down so i can
3:34
see very clearly what tasks am i doing
3:36
related to goal one
3:38
related to goal number two which is
3:39
related to my heart breathing's channel
3:41
so i've got this video edited post the
3:42
plan with me is what i'm working on
3:44
right now and then goal number three is
3:46
more of my like time tracking and
3:48
morning routine
3:49
type goals then at the bottom i'm doing
3:52
something a little different and i know
3:54
a lot of you are looking forward to
3:55
seeing kind of how i've been tracking my
3:57
time
3:57
also that cute little track my time
3:59
sticker is from adrienne at procrasti
4:01
planner etc
4:03
and i know the page just turned but if
4:04
you noticed i was putting little numbers
4:06
in circles there at the bottom
4:08
what i've been doing is trying to every
4:10
week estimate
4:11
how many basic like pomodoro sprints
4:14
it will take me to finish that task so
4:16
for example
4:18
if i'm working through editing this plan
4:21
with me
4:22
and recording it or whatever i know that
4:24
it's going to take me probably at least
4:27
you know two hours to edit it to get it
4:30
posted
4:30
and all of that so that's basically for
4:33
pomodoro sprints because they're about
4:34
25 minutes a piece
4:36
so i would write four next to it and
4:38
then i'm estimating that i'm going to
4:40
need that much time to complete that
4:41
task
4:42
and i do that for every task on my list
4:45
and so then what i end up with
4:47
is an estimate of how many pomodoro
4:49
tasks i'm going to need or how many
4:51
pomodoro sessions
4:52
i'm going to need to finish that entire
4:55
work for the week and this week it is
4:57
way more than normal because so you can
5:00
see there i have that track my time
5:02
sticker and i have the 107 underneath it
5:05
that's how many pomodoro sessions i need
5:07
or 30 minute sprint sessions i need
5:10
to complete this week's work that is way
5:12
more than normal
5:13
partly because like i said i lost my
5:15
assistant suddenly and i just was not
5:17
prepared for that i wish her absolutely
5:20
the best many of you have worked with
5:21
janet in the past she is amazing but she
5:23
just had
5:24
an opportunity that she needed to take
5:25
and so there are no hard feelings there
5:27
she's
5:27
wonderful and i wish her the very best
5:29
but it's just
5:30
a little bit more on my plate right now
5:32
so no complaints just
5:33
some things that i got to take care of
5:35
so i am working through that but also
5:38
the majority of the time going this week
5:41
is
5:41
dedicated to editing this book and i am
5:44
a forever procrastinator and i kind of
5:46
feel like
5:47
for me let me know in the comments if
5:49
you can relate to this
5:51
i feel like for me so much of my own
5:54
like
5:54
magic comes when i'm on that deadline
5:58
so you know when i get to be a week out
6:00
or two weeks out from a major deadline
6:02
that's when something inside me sort of
6:04
switches on and i can
6:06
like hyper focus and my best work comes
6:08
out i'm
6:09
trying to be different i'm trying to
6:11
change my ways of working up to the last
6:13
minute
6:14
but for now this is what works for me so
6:16
i'm gonna be
6:17
spending a lot of sleepless nights
6:18
probably this week i'm also trying to
6:21
manage my emotions like the
6:24
anxiety and things that i've been
6:25
fighting with lately by
6:27
spending more time gaming and out with
6:29
the kids so because i know it's going to
6:31
be a really
6:33
busy couple of weeks coming up plus then
6:35
the launch plus we've got the hp 90
6:37
boot camp is going to be opening for
6:38
registration on june 1st
6:40
so there's a lot of work coming up plus
6:42
the packing and things we're getting
6:43
ready for the house
6:44
so it's extra important and this is if i
6:47
have any tips for you
6:48
this is one of them for managing anxiety
6:50
and stress is when you know
6:52
you're gonna have like major time
6:55
crunches
6:56
try to it seems counterintuitive because
6:59
it's like if you're super super busy and
7:01
you don't
7:02
have any time to relax you could be like
7:04
i don't have time to play a game tonight
7:06
i need to be working
7:07
but if you push yourself to the absolute
7:09
limit you're actually going to get less
7:10
work done
7:11
taking breaks is necessary so if you
7:14
know you're going to be in a really big
7:16
crunch or really stressful time period
7:18
make sure that you put
7:19
in your planner time to go gaming time
7:22
to go to the beach
7:23
time to go to the pool time to do
7:25
whatever it is for you personally
7:26
helps you relax read a book do some
7:29
extra cooking if
7:30
you want clean the house declutter
7:32
everybody has kind of their own things
7:33
that they
7:34
love to do that will help them to feel a
7:36
little bit more supported
7:37
or more relaxed so
7:40
put that into your planner you can see
7:42
i've added like gaming time
7:45
i've got a pool day i've got some time
7:47
that we're going to be spending as a
7:49
family outside
7:50
and you know yes i'm going to be up all
7:52
night some of these nights as well
7:55
but if i don't take the time to also
7:57
relax then i'm just going to burn out
7:59
and i won't be able to finish the book
8:00
on time so that's kind of one of my
8:02
bigger tips is you have to make time for
8:05
you know self-care is such a buzzword
8:07
these days
8:08
but i don't know that i want to use the
8:10
word self-care
8:11
but you just have to take time to have
8:14
some fun and some down time and relax
8:17
time for yourself because otherwise
8:19
you're just going to
8:20
push yourself to the limit until you
8:22
break and i have done that to myself
8:24
before
8:25
many times and it is not pretty once you
8:28
kind of come up for air from it
8:31
so what you see here and these are the
8:33
actual so that first page that you guys
8:35
saw me use that first spread
8:36
i list all my tasks for the week and
8:38
that's just basically like
8:40
what i know i have to do i also will
8:42
list any appointments and things that i
8:44
know i need
8:45
to attend and things like that on this
8:48
second spread though i'm taking all the
8:50
tasks that i decided i wanted to get
8:52
done this week
8:53
and then i'm actually planning them out
8:55
according to the days
8:56
and how i'm going to organize those days
8:59
and sometimes at this stage of the
9:01
process when i start actually writing
9:02
things down i might realize you know
9:04
what there's no way i'm going to have
9:05
time to get all that stuff done and then
9:06
i have to go back and either
9:08
wipe things out or i have to you know
9:11
change them in some way or move them to
9:13
the following week
9:14
and for me this is kind of like a checks
9:16
and balance
9:17
type system because i can see what i
9:20
want to do what's my ideal tasks that i
9:22
want to get done
9:23
then i schedule them out and try to be
9:24
as realistic as possible
9:26
in my actual schedule and when i write
9:28
it out on these pages on this weekly
9:30
spread is when i start to see
9:32
can i really squeeze that much into the
9:34
day and it's not
9:36
just about time it's also about energy
9:39
so when i start looking at this
9:40
sometimes i'm gonna be like oh you know
9:42
what there's no way i'm gonna have this
9:43
two hour meeting
9:44
and then also do five hours of sprints
9:47
and do a live stream
9:48
and record a video like this is where
9:50
reality starts to check for me
9:53
so it's definitely a checks and balances
9:54
but this spread
9:56
is still just an ideal this is like
9:58
ideal
9:59
if i have the perfect week this is what
10:01
i want to get done
10:03
and for me where i struggled with
10:04
planners a lot in the past like main
10:06
weekly planners
10:07
is they would have the week but not
10:10
daily pages or they have daily pages but
10:12
no week
10:13
and i really need both and so that's
10:16
part of why i designed this
10:18
planner in particular because i've got
10:20
that task
10:21
spread there that i get to choose kind
10:24
of what i want to get done for the week
10:26
then this weekly spread is my ideal
10:29
overview of how i want to get it done
10:31
then i've got the daily pages that come
10:33
after this that i can work through the
10:36
day before
10:37
and plan my ideal day as the week
10:40
progresses because here i might have
10:42
like wednesday i'm doing
10:44
you know working from one to three on
10:45
sprints but by the time
10:47
i finish tuesday i might realize you
10:49
know what i didn't get nearly as
10:51
many sprints as i intended to get so now
10:53
i've got to squeeze in five extra
10:54
sprints today so where can i do that
10:56
so it allows me to be flexible but also
10:59
realistic and to not beat myself up when
11:01
things aren't exactly the way i want
11:03
them to be
11:04
because back when i just used a weekly
11:06
planner only i tended to
11:08
feel really frustrated because by the
11:10
time i got to tuesday or wednesday my
11:11
whole plan was out the window
11:13
and this allows me to create the ideal
11:15
plan
11:16
and then still plan to day to day so
11:19
you'll also notice
11:20
as i'm going through this that i often
11:23
just plan kind of out of order
11:24
as things come up i don't plan all of
11:26
monday all of tuesday
11:28
you can see like i had started adding
11:29
some to thursday right away and then i
11:32
switched back to monday and then i'd go
11:33
back to sunday
11:34
and part of that is because i know the
11:36
things that i want to get done because i
11:38
decided that on that task page
11:40
but when i'm working my way through this
11:42
i also am thinking
11:44
okay what day do i want to get this done
11:46
okay i think i'll try to get that done
11:47
on tuesday or i think i have time on
11:49
tuesday
11:49
and so that for me is basically how i
11:52
plan my week and i use
11:53
lots of cute stickers i really enjoy
11:56
using the stickers
11:57
i will link all the sticker shops below
11:59
that i tend to use it's like coffee
12:00
monsters co
12:01
procrasti planner etc plan to plan
12:05
sometimes i use stickers from studio
12:07
adorkable
12:08
very cute designs uh laven forest
12:12
i have a lot of shops that i tend to
12:13
like best that i use their stickers over
12:16
and over
12:17
this week to make it a little bit faster
12:19
i actually pulled all the stickers i
12:21
thought i was going to use
12:22
for the whole week so i didn't have to
12:23
go digging through my sticker books
12:25
then i go through the daily pages like
12:27
you just saw me do
12:29
and i add some washi tape that kind of
12:32
coordinates with the week
12:33
because for me that just makes it a
12:35
little bit prettier and easier for the
12:37
whole week
12:38
so there you have it it took me like
12:40
i've
12:41
obviously sped this up but it took me
12:44
probably about
12:46
30 minutes i think i double speed sped
12:49
this maybe 40 minutes to get that
12:51
planning done
12:52
and then what i do this is kind of my
12:53
sunday ritual is i also go through and
12:56
plan monday
12:57
and then monday night i'll go through
12:58
and plan tuesday and so on so i plan a
13:00
day ahead on the daily pages
13:02
so this is what the daily pages of the
13:04
planner look like and i will
13:06
write three things at the top that
13:08
aren't necessarily like tasks
13:09
toward my goals but things that just
13:11
need to get done like oh i got to send
13:13
out these giveaways or i got to pick up
13:14
my mail
13:15
i also have a color coding system that
13:18
goes along with my time tracker
13:20
and my kanban board so again i'll be
13:22
doing a full video on this coming up
13:23
soon
13:24
but i track basically a color code
13:27
according to
13:28
which project or goal i'm working on so
13:30
the dark purple is my writing and edits
13:33
the light purple is my admin work for my
13:36
writing career
13:38
whereas the light pink is my admin work
13:40
for heart breathings
13:41
the darker pink is my youtube channel
13:43
stuff
13:44
and the blue color is my planning that
13:47
green color that you see there to the
13:48
left is for course work and stuff like
13:51
that so
13:52
i love my color code it is really
13:53
working well for me i've been using it
13:55
for about a year
13:56
so i will go over that soon too then
13:59
over on the left side
14:00
i do have the hours kind of printed out
14:02
there it's similar to kind of like a
14:04
hobonichi setup and i will plan out my
14:07
ideal day
14:08
according to that now you can see that
14:10
i'm also writing out estimates
14:12
of how many pomodoro sprints i think
14:14
it's going to take me so i'm planning
14:16
to spend ten sprints on edits
14:19
three on youtube and three on admin and
14:22
then
14:22
you can see in that other little box i
14:24
wrote how many i estimated
14:25
to spend and then later that day i would
14:28
write how many i actually spent and that
14:30
keeps me on track to say
14:31
okay if i consistently think i'm going
14:33
to spend
14:34
you know 17 pomodoros a day
14:38
but i'm only ever spending 10 then i
14:40
know that i'm like biting off more than
14:42
i can chew
14:43
so here's a really good look or a closer
14:45
look at how the planner turns out
14:47
i don't have really great handwriting
14:49
and i don't really worry about it
14:51
because the stickers makes
14:52
everything cute so i hope you guys
14:55
enjoyed this i will be back to our
14:56
normal kind of content coming up soon
14:59
with getting back to our videos on
15:02
how to write great ideas so stay tuned
15:05
for that but otherwise i hope you have
15:07
an awesome week and i will hang out with
15:09
you guys
15:10
once this book is done all right have a
15:13
great weekend y'all
15:26
[Music]
15:34
you

hey guys welcome back to heart
0:01
breathing's if you didn't know I'm doing
0:03
just a two-part video on how to have a
0:05
really successful writing retreat this
0:07
is something that has been so useful and
0:10
beneficial to me in terms of getting so
0:12
many books out per year like last year I
0:14
got five books out which is kind of a
0:16
record for me it's a lot of books for me
0:18
I usually get more like two or three out
0:20
in a year but even to write two or three
0:22
books in a year takes a lot of focus and
0:24
a lot of hard work so I really relied
0:27
especially last year on really good
0:29
writing retreats to help me get like a
0:31
larger amount of words done and get
0:33
really focused in on my story so
0:35
yesterday I uploaded a video on just
0:38
behind the scenes peek at my most recent
0:40
writing retreat with my friend Zoe
0:42
Dawson who writes Navy SEALs and other
0:44
types of romance and we've been friends
0:47
and critique she was actually my very
0:48
first critique partner we've been
0:49
friends for years and we go on writing
0:51
retreats a couple of times a year so I
0:53
uploaded that blog so if you haven't had
0:55
a chance to watch it I'll add a card up
0:57
here on the screen somewhere and I'll
0:58
also link that video in the description
1:00
down below so you can check it out and
1:01
today is part two where I'm going to
1:03
give you my top ten tips for having a
1:06
successful writing retreat so let's get
1:08
started so number one is to know what
1:14
you're writing when you leave to go so
Know What You're Writing
1:17
spend time before you head out to your
1:19
writing retreat and make up note cards
1:21
even if you're a pantser it can still
1:25
help you to write out just some little
1:26
note cards of ideas for scenes that you
1:28
have coming up because there's nothing
1:30
worse than getting to a writing retreat
1:31
you've paid for that you set time aside
1:33
for like as a mom it is difficult for me
1:36
to get away from you know the house and
1:39
everything because I hate to leave my
1:40
son for a few nights so I'm making a
1:41
sacrifice my husband is making a
1:43
sacrifice cuz he's taking on more duties
1:45
than he normally does you know with our
1:47
son and with the household and stuff so
1:49
it's a sacrifice to take those three or
1:51
four days off but hopefully the reward
1:53
outweighs the sacrifice and it only
1:55
happens a few times a year but there's
1:56
nothing worse than making that big
1:58
sacrifice and then getting home in real
2:00
or getting there and realizing I don't
2:03
know what I'm writing exactly so when I
2:04
sit down to sprint it's just like
2:06
nothing comes because there's pressure
2:08
or there's like distractions so knowing
2:11
what you're going to write
2:12
ahead of time even just a basic like
2:15
idea of a scene on a note card or a
2:17
little bit of a bullet point of these
2:19
are the scenes I'm gonna work on can
2:20
really go a long way because when you
2:22
sit down to write you know exactly what
2:24
you're working on that's huge
2:26
number two setting a goal so kind of
Set A Goal Tip #2
2:28
getting an idea of on average how much
2:31
do you write per sprint if you're
2:34
writing in Sprint's or how much do you
2:35
write per hour if you like to write in
2:37
longer chunks and then try to decide
2:39
about how many hours are you going to be
2:41
able to work everyday or how many
2:42
Sprint's do you want to do everyday and
2:44
multiply that out and decide what your
2:46
goal is for the writing retreat for this
2:48
retreat I set my goal at 20,000 words
2:51
and sometimes I will set it only maybe
2:53
like 15,000 words and sometimes I'll set
2:55
a goal more like 30,000 words it just
2:57
kind of depends where I am in the story
2:59
if I know things are flowing if I know I
3:01
can push myself a little bit harder
3:03
because I've gotten lots of rest in the
3:04
past and so it just kind of depends what
3:08
your personal goal is what your personal
3:11
best is and it's not a competition thing
3:13
like you may be going away for a three
3:15
day writing retreat and you know that
3:16
like if you could just get 3,000 words a
3:18
day that would be a huge win for you so
3:20
you may set a goal of only 9,000 words
3:22
and that is still amazing because you
3:25
spent the time you got immersed in your
3:27
story you made a lot of progress so it's
3:30
not about like comparing yourself to oh
3:31
I didn't can't write 20,000 words in
3:33
three days or oh my gosh I could write
3:35
40,000 words it's not about that it's
3:37
just about what is your personal goal
3:39
when you go in and setting that goal and
3:41
kind of knowing where you want to be can
3:43
be really motivating along the way
3:44
number three is to keep track of how
3:46
you're doing in regards to that goal so
3:49
especially when you're spreading a
3:50
writing retreat out over several days it
3:52
can be helpful to know not only your
3:54
goal for the entire retreat but your
3:56
goal for each day so when I set that
3:58
goal for 20,000 words I was hoping to
4:01
get about 5,000 words the first day and
4:03
then that would spread the other 15,000
4:06
over the next two days which would be
4:07
about 7,500 words a day and I didn't
4:11
quite make it to the 5,000 on day one so
4:13
that let me know since I was keeping
4:14
track that I needed to kind of step up
4:16
my game a little bit on day two and get
4:18
more like eight or nine thousand words
4:20
so you can kind of see in the vlog how I
4:22
made up that time when I only got about
4:24
3500 words the first day but when you're
4:27
keeping track especially like I like to
4:29
do with that sticky like flipchart paper
4:32
on the wall is super nice like I do keep
4:36
track of it in my planner too but my you
4:37
know I can keep my planner open but
4:39
there's just something about having a
4:40
writing retreat where you put that
4:42
poster on the wall and you can see
4:43
exactly how many words you've gotten how
4:45
much progress you've made or how much
4:48
you've been slacking off and talking too
4:49
much or eating too many chips or like
4:51
binge watching Netflix or something when
4:53
you shouldn't have been then you could
4:54
say oh man like to wake up on day 2 and
4:56
you say oh my gosh I barely got any
4:58
words written yesterday I've really got
4:59
to get to it so it can be a motivating
5:01
factor to keep track in a place where
5:03
you can see it front and center so
5:05
number four is to remove distractions so
5:08
that means turning your phone on do not
Remove Distractions Tip
5:10
disturb even potentially taking some of
5:12
your social media apps off of your phone
5:14
turning your you know your ringer off
5:16
telling your friends and family hey I'm
5:18
going to be gone for four days writing
5:20
please do not disturb me with text
5:22
messages or anything else unless you
5:24
absolutely need me
5:25
setting your phone in the other room you
5:27
could just go put it in the charger and
5:28
only use your laptop for your timer if
5:30
you're doing writing sprints but
5:31
removing distractions as much as
5:33
possible and especially social media is
5:35
key
5:36
because I find when I'm sitting down to
5:39
write I often am more susceptible to
5:42
distractions because the writing is hard
5:43
work it's very focused in work and if I
5:46
am just sitting there kind of not sure
5:50
exactly or not feeling motivated
5:51
especially when I'm like ten thousand
5:53
words into a writing retreat and I'm
5:55
starting to feel kind of tired
5:56
I'm very distractible so it's very easy
5:58
if someone sends me a message through
6:00
Facebook messenger for me to get wrapped
6:02
up in a conversation and before you know
6:04
it and hours gone by and haven't gotten
6:06
any writing done so removing those
6:07
distractions
6:08
particularly when it comes to social
6:10
media is key for a successful writing
6:12
retreat I talked about this some in the
6:14
video so it won't cover it too much but
Eat Healthy
6:16
number five is to eat healthy and I know
6:19
there are probably many of you out there
6:20
and that love your like cookies and soda
6:23
and Red Bulls or whatever else so you
6:25
know if this doesn't work for you then
6:26
you know just try it on your own there's
6:29
no judgment here because this is the way
6:30
I used to do writing retreats too as I
6:32
would be like using it as an excuse to
6:35
buy all the snacks to order pizza and
6:36
have all this kind of junk food and
6:38
everything else and I was really
6:40
addicted to sugar so I just happened to
6:43
notice when I would do that and I would
6:45
really like binge on sugar have lots of
6:49
snacks be eating chips while I'm writing
6:51
having Red Bull to keep me up all night
6:52
I noticed that I would you know have
6:55
maybe one really good night where I'm
6:57
like fueled on all this sugar and then I
6:59
would completely crash for day two I'd
7:01
want to sleep in I'd start to feel
7:03
really lethargic it's like when you come
7:04
down from that sugar high that you just
7:07
completely crashed so of course you
7:09
could always give yourself little treats
7:11
along the way instead of binge eating
7:12
it's not like another or thing but that
7:14
was just my experience so when I cut out
7:16
sugar and flour and I started really
7:18
going healthy and actually before I cut
7:21
out all sugar and flour I started eating
7:24
healthier on writing retreats and
7:25
writing nights even though I was still
7:28
eating kind of junky foods on a regular
7:30
basis I specifically tried okay I'm
7:32
gonna take things like celery and peanut
7:34
butter or carrots or like have nice
7:39
dinner at the hotel restaurant or
7:41
something and just have like meat and
7:43
vegetables instead of having you know
7:45
bread and things that kind of weighed me
7:48
down and I used to write at this
7:50
Marriott that had like one of their
7:53
appetizers was this hummus plate that
7:55
you could get instead of getting like
7:56
pita bread you could get lots of veggies
7:58
and at the time I was like not a huge
8:00
fan of eating lots of veggies but I
8:02
would eat that anyway and get a water
8:05
when I would go to right there.that
8:07
hotel and I just happened to notice that
8:09
when I would fuel my body with these
8:10
healthy foods I would get so much more
8:13
done and I would be able to stay up
8:14
later I would have such a more clear
8:16
mind I wouldn't have that like sugar
8:18
crash so as I said this is not a
8:21
judgment thing so if you like your junk
8:23
food go ahead eat your junk food if it
8:24
motivates you to be able to eat your
8:26
Oreos into the night then go for it but
8:28
I just personally have found that the
8:30
healthy art eat throughout the writing
8:31
retreat the better I feel because I'm
8:33
more awake and my brain is more alert so
8:35
cutting out sugar breads that kind of
8:38
thing and really eating lots of
8:39
vegetables lots of good protein and only
8:42
drinking water has sincerely helped my
8:45
productivity and focus on writing
8:47
retreats ok we're halfway through the
8:48
list so number six is
8:50
to find a comfortable space so when we
Make Your Space Comfortable
8:54
pick air B&B I go often with my friends
8:58
so we will go riding together and I have
9:00
a few other friends that I've been on
9:01
writing retreats with and whenever we go
9:03
we take a look at the space and we make
9:05
sure that there's a good comfortable
9:06
couch there's a good comfortable space
9:09
to sit all of our stuff out and if
9:11
there's no good table because you'll
9:13
find it a lot of hotels like there won't
9:15
be tables in the room or you'll find
9:17
some Airbnb even the tables are really
9:19
small or I think I mentioned this little
9:21
last when we stayed out we couldn't tell
9:22
from the pictures when we got there were
9:24
kind of disappointed that I had one of
9:25
those like bar top tables so it just
9:28
wasn't super comfortable to be sitting
9:30
at a high-top table the whole time so we
9:32
mostly worked on the couch so just make
9:34
sure that you have a comfortable space
9:36
and bring things with you that make you
9:37
feel comfortable bring your best PJs
9:39
bring your favorite pillow bring your
9:42
little you know Hello kitties or your
9:44
crystals or whatever it is that you want
9:46
to bring that make you feel more
9:48
comfortable that make you feel more
9:49
productive and surround yourself with
9:51
those things your candles your like any
9:53
kind of motivational figurines or your
9:56
favorite like hand warmers or you know
9:59
just whatever it is if it makes you feel
10:01
good like your your favorite ear buds
10:03
that don't hurt your ears whatever it is
10:05
just bring those things with you because
10:06
you want to be as comfortable as
10:07
possible because when we talk about
10:08
eliminating distractions you know if you
10:11
don't have the things that make you feel
10:12
comfortable to sit and write then you're
10:15
not you're going to be more distracted
10:17
when you're writing so be comfortable
10:18
make sure the space that you're renting
10:20
or going to is also comfortable and
10:22
filled with comfortable things I will
10:24
just throw in here as an aside that if
10:26
you do end up going on a lot of writing
10:27
retreats you'll start to notice that
10:29
some places have better energy for
10:31
writing I know this sounds crazy but
10:32
like I've been to beautiful places that
10:35
were just gorgeous like right on the
10:36
lake but it just didn't have a good
10:38
energy to it like the space or something
10:41
didn't have this like flowing energy and
10:43
both me and my friend that were there
10:45
could neither one of us could really get
10:47
the words flowing but then like my
10:49
friend Bella and I stayed at this cabin
10:51
that was really inexpensive like super
10:53
cheap and it was right on the lake but
10:56
it was like really old like kind of
10:58
run-down kind of ratty couches and stuff
11:00
the kitchen was very it was kind of like
11:02
you imagine like an old Fisher
11:04
like you seize this place but you know
11:06
very inexpensive very rustic we'll say
11:09
but that place had energy and every time
11:12
we went there we went back three or four
11:14
times and every time we went we just got
11:16
so many words done and we were just
11:18
flowing with lots of words so if you
11:19
find a good place that has really good
11:21
energy that is also a good tip to keep
11:23
going back to those places and to not go
11:25
back to places that you felt did not
11:28
have good energy for you for writing
11:30
number seven enlist the help or company
Write With Friends
11:33
of your friends I've been on a few
11:35
writing retreats where I've gotten a lot
11:36
done when I go by myself but in general
11:38
I really enjoy having my friends there
11:40
like at least one friend or two with me
11:42
you do end up talking more sometimes so
11:45
that can be a little bit less productive
11:47
but it's also good when you have the
11:49
kind of friend that you can say okay
11:50
we're going to sprint from this time to
11:51
this time we're gonna work really hard
11:53
from this time to this time and then
11:54
we'll have dinner from 6:00 to 8:00
11:56
where we'll cook and we'll get to chat
11:58
and then we're gonna get right back to
11:59
work so if you find the kind of friend
12:00
that is self-motivated in that way that
12:03
you can really trust to say okay it's
12:05
time to stop talking let's sit down and
12:07
write then I think it can be really
12:08
helpful I also like I said have a
12:10
Facebook group of friends where we will
12:12
sprint together and so I went in and we
12:15
did a virtual retreat while I was gone
12:17
on my real retreat and they joined me in
12:19
on a lot of those Sprint's and
12:20
everything so it is very helpful
12:22
sometimes if you can enlist the help an
12:24
energy of friends who are actually
12:25
sprinting but on the flip side of that
12:27
just make sure that you're able to tell
12:29
them okay I'm done talking I'm done
12:31
chatting about this stuff because it can
12:33
become a very social destruction as well
12:35
so be ready to put the hammer down you
12:37
know when it's time to start writing and
12:39
I know just as a side like I know I've
12:41
mentioned the sprinting group on
12:42
Facebook several times and I always get
12:44
a lot of questions here about what's the
12:47
name of the group and that sort of thing
12:48
but it's kind of a small group of
12:49
friends and so they don't really want to
12:51
get huge and like invite hundreds of
12:54
people into the group so it's not really
12:55
an open group I'm sorry to say for me to
12:57
just invite everybody into but if you
12:59
guys are really interested in me
13:01
starting a heart breathing sprinting
13:03
group where anyone who watches this
13:04
channel is interested in getting
13:06
together and doing writing or writing
13:07
retreats like virtual retreats or
13:09
writing sprints together let me know and
13:11
I can maybe get that started for us all
13:13
to join together as a community so put
13:15
that in the comments so number eight of
13:17
course is writing
13:18
prints and I've talked about this many
Write In Sprints Tip
13:19
times in my channel that is basically
13:21
just picking a time like 15 20 25
13:23
minutes that is you know usually a
13:25
smaller
13:26
I think anything where you start to go
13:28
over like 25 or 30 minutes you start to
13:30
get diminishing returns but I do know
13:32
some people that like to sprint for a
13:33
full hour so you just will find what
13:35
works best for you
13:36
I protect personally like 20 or 25
13:39
minutes prints and then after each
13:41
sprint you take a break so you can get
13:42
up walk around get a glass of water but
13:45
having that like focused time with a
13:46
timer going on and you've got absolutely
13:48
no distraction can be one of the best
13:50
ways to get a lot of writing done
13:52
on a writing retreat so instead of
13:54
saying I'm gonna write from 8 a.m. to
13:56
noon and then have lunch and then write
13:58
from 1 to 4 and you've got this just big
14:00
chunks of time we're just kind of slowly
14:02
starting to get some words and you're
14:04
kind of thinking about it and then
14:05
you're talking and you're doing this and
14:06
you're doing that you might find that
14:08
over the course of 4 hours you only get
14:09
a thousand words but if you sit down and
14:12
you sprint and you say okay I'm gonna
14:13
focus for 20 minutes no talking I've got
14:15
my earbuds in I'm gonna be completely
14:17
focused for 20 minutes and go and you
14:20
let that timer start and get going then
14:22
you might find that in 20 minutes you're
14:25
able to write 500 words so in just 2
14:28
Sprint's you've already maximized your
14:30
output that you could have you know that
14:32
you did in 4 hours of just kind of
14:33
leisurely writing so I personally find
14:36
that writing Sprint's has pretty much
14:37
changed my life when it comes to
14:39
productivity so I highly recommend them
14:40
on writing retreats to more so number 9
14:43
this is just a writing fast kind of
14:45
thing on a writing retreat and it kind
14:48
of depends on what your goals are for
14:49
the retreat itself but I find that it
14:51
helps to just completely turn off my
14:52
inner critic to not go back and read
Silence Your Inner Critic
14:54
what I've written to not try to edit it
14:56
to not try to make it better and as I'm
14:59
writing if I can hit a point where I'm
15:01
like well this completely sucks but I
15:03
really want to get this writing sprint
15:04
done I will even sometimes write it into
15:07
my manuscript I will write in xx because
15:08
I always go back and edit and look for
15:11
all the X's in case there's something I
15:12
need to fix and I will write a note to
15:14
myself and say I know this is the worst
15:15
thing I've ever written but I'm gonna
15:17
keep going go go go
15:18
and then I will keep writing but it kind
15:20
of gets it out it's like releasing that
15:22
inner critic and saying I know these
15:25
aren't my best words I know they're
15:26
going to have to be edited later but I'm
15:28
here to get as many words as I can so I
15:30
can discover the
15:31
story and that can always be edited
15:33
later but you can't edit a blank page so
15:36
just get the words out and stop trying
15:38
to critique every single word I find
15:41
that helps at writing retreats because
15:42
you are just trying to open up your
15:44
heart open up your mind and just let the
15:46
words flow and there's gonna be some
15:48
words you'll throw out but there will be
15:49
some really good stuff that you'll
15:51
discover too so turn off that inner
15:52
critic and my final little tip here is
15:55
to reward yourself so have a rewarded
15:59
mind you've got your goal in mind have a
Reward Yourself Tip #10
16:00
reward in mind and sometimes yes the
16:02
writing retreat itself is a reward
16:04
because you kind of got to get away
16:05
maybe you were staying by the beach or
16:07
another beautiful place by the lake but
16:09
it really helps sometimes to have a
16:11
reward even if it's something small like
16:13
when I get home I'm going to reward
16:15
myself with a whole day off of you know
16:17
binge watching youtube videos and it's
16:19
gonna be glorious that can be your
16:21
reward your reward can also be once
16:24
you've finished for the day
16:25
a walk on the beach if you're still
16:26
there at the writing retreat you say
16:28
okay if I hit my 5,000 words by 2:00
16:30
p.m. I'm gonna go for a long walk on the
16:32
beach but just having those little
16:34
rewards that you give yourself along the
16:35
way it's just so beneficial because
16:38
writing is hard guys it is really tough
16:42
and I think that people who are not
16:43
writers don't realize how difficult it
16:45
is to get all the way through you know
16:48
100,000 word book and then when that's
16:50
over to turn around and edit it and try
16:52
to polish it and publish it and then
16:53
turn around and write another book in
16:55
that world or even in another series
16:57
writing is not easy so when you are able
16:59
to give yourself that gift of I'm gonna
17:01
focus in but you're kind of pushing
17:03
yourself too I'm gonna write you know
17:05
20,000 words in just a week or just a
17:08
few days and you're kind of forcing your
17:10
mind to focus in for long periods of
17:12
time it's just really good to give
17:14
yourself that reward where you say oh my
17:16
gosh I'm so proud of myself I did such a
17:18
great job kind of pat on the back so
17:21
don't forget to reward yourself I
17:22
sincerely hope that you guys enjoyed
17:24
both the writing retreat vlog and these
17:27
top 10 tips for how to have a successful
17:29
writing retreat please be sure to let me
17:31
know in the comments if you guys would
17:32
be interested in having a heart
17:34
breathing sprinting group or we all kind
17:35
of get together have virtual writing
17:37
retreats online in a Facebook group and
17:39
where we
17:40
Sprint's together throughout the week I
17:41
would be happy to start that if there is
17:43
interest for it so let me know down in
17:45
the comments if you want to see that
17:47
happen also let me know if you're going
17:50
on your own writing retreat or if you
17:51
have been on a writing retreat lately
17:53
and how it went for you and if you enjoy
17:55
them if you think that you're gonna
17:57
utilize some of these tips that you
17:59
didn't do in the past or if you're
18:00
planning writing retreat I'd love to
18:01
hear more about your story and your
18:03
journey I know that it can be a luxury
18:05
to be able to go on writing retreats
18:06
because not everybody has you know even
18:09
150 dollars to go out with a friend and
18:11
spend for a couple of days but if you
18:13
want to I can also do a video on how to
18:15
have a virtual writing retreat which is
18:17
something that I just recently have
18:19
started doing in my private sprinting
18:21
Facebook group with my friends we did
18:22
this for this most recent writing
18:24
retreat
18:25
because there are a lot of people in
18:26
that group who can't get away due to
18:28
having children young children at home
18:30
like when my son was really young I
18:32
couldn't do this obviously because I
18:34
couldn't leave him behind but now that
18:36
he's almost 7 it's a little easier
18:37
because my husband can help out but a
18:39
lot of you have younger children at home
18:41
or it can be kind of a financial burden
18:43
to try to get away for three or four
18:45
days to an air B&B and that sort of
18:47
thing so virtual writing retreats can be
18:49
just as helpful or even Hotel nights
18:51
where you're just doing one night so if
18:53
you'd like to see more videos on how to
18:55
do a virtual writing retreat please let
18:57
me know also make sure that you are
18:59
subscribed to this channel and hit that
19:01
notification bell so that you'll get
19:02
notified whenever new videos come up
19:04
from heart breathing's I have lots of
19:06
great stuff coming up in the next few
19:08
weeks so I hope that you will join me as
19:10
we talk about writing and planning and
19:12
organizing your entrepreneurial life
19:14
alright guys that is all I have for
19:16
today I hope you enjoyed these tips and
19:18
I hope to see you in the comments all
19:20
right I'll see you on the next one bye
19:23
[Music]
hey guys welcome back to my channel I am author Sarah Cannon and it is launch
0:05
week for me which is so exciting for me if you've been following me for a while here on Hart breathing's you'd know that even
0:12
though I have published 26 novels now in the last 10 years it has actually been a
0:18
full year and a half since I've had a new book release part of that is due to having a baby part of its due to moving
0:25
and some of it is due to spending a lot of time on this YouTube channel and growing it here so it is extremely
0:31
exciting for me that I have a new book out if you would like to support me and pick up my new release it is called the
0:37
witch's key and I actually read this live every single day in the month of April as I was writing it over on my
0:45
other YouTube channel so if you're interested in watching that process as it unfolds you can find a video playlist
0:51
for that down below but what better time to come to you and talk to you about my
0:57
top recommendations for how to promote and market your new release or how to launch your book so I've got some great
1:04
tips for you here today and it's a long list so let's get started so one thing
1:13
that I want to say to you before we even go into any tips is there is no one-size-fits-all way to self publish
1:21
your book or to launch your book you can really customize and tailor your book launch to what you enjoy doing to what
1:28
seems right to you to what resources you have available so don't let anybody tell you this is the way you have to do it
1:34
here's the formula this is the only way you're going to be successful because in indie publishing we have so much freedom
1:41
and so much opportunity at our fingertips that there is no one-size-fit-all or you have to do this
1:48
it's really a matter of just picking and choosing what feels right for you learning from the process and then
1:54
getting better next time indie publishing really is not about just putting out that one book and having
2:00
millions of dollars of success and then retiring it's really about building up a
2:06
readership and a community for a lifetime so please keep in mind that
2:11
even though I'm going to give you a lot of tips and a lot of ideas you don't have to and you're definitely not expected to
2:17
implement all of these for your first book launch some of them will be more effective for your first book some will
2:24
be more effective for later books in your series or in your career so I'm going to just give you a bunch of
2:29
different tips and then try something each time you launch a book so for book one you might try two or three things on
2:35
this list you might pull from lists online but whatever you do just know that it's a learning process and your
2:43
book launch is really just a day or a week in the life of a book that is so
2:48
long in traditional publishing they put a lot of pressure on launch week and the
2:54
pre-order for a book and if that book doesn't sell out or have a huge following right away sometimes they'll
3:01
drop an author but that's one of the advantages to being indie you could really start small and then grow huge
3:07
over time and so don't sell yourself short I look at it like having a baby
3:13
that day they are born is really just one day in a very long and beautiful life of a human being the book launch
3:20
day for your book is an important day but it's really just one day or one week in the life of your book I sold maybe
3:28
ten copies maybe somewhere around 12 copies the very first day I launched a book and I was ecstatic about that don't
3:35
put pressure on yourself to sell thousands of books your first week it's okay to grow slowly and to grow with
3:42
each book that you put out because that like 10 book launch day eventually led to over three quarters of a million
3:49
books sold and over a million dollars in profits so it can grow and don't judge
3:55
yourself based on one book or one day so that little caveat aside let's talk
4:01
about some of my top tips for launching your book so my first tip is less about the marketing and more about managing
4:08
yourself and your time the tip is to create a checklist and a plan for your
Create a launch checklist Description
4:14
launch so what you need to do is gather all of the information that you found through this YouTube video through other
4:20
blogs you've read and by talking to other authors decide which things you're going to try so that you
4:26
can narrow it down it's not about throwing spaghetti at the wall it's about deciding what really works for you
4:32
right now and focusing in on making those four or five things really really
4:38
strong because if you focus in on having an amazing book launch with just four or
4:44
five things you're gonna be better off than if you tried to just halfway do 12
4:49
or 13 things so I highly recommend that you create a checklist of the things you want to try for this particular book and
4:56
then schedule them out so if you're going to do teasers which we'll talk about in a second schedule out exactly
5:02
when and where you're going to post those figure out what you need to have setup so that you can get all of that
5:07
ball rolling having a checklist and a plan in place is imperative because otherwise you do end up just throwing
5:14
spaghetti at the wall if you would like a free checklist of everything you need
5:19
to decide and do before you can self publish your book like getting ISBNs
5:24
your cover art deciding your keywords all of those types of things I do have a free checklist on my newsletter list I
5:32
have an entire google drive full of resources for you from how to plot your novel to everything you need before you
5:38
self publish so sign up for my list in the link down below in the description box and I will send you a link to that
5:44
entire Google Drive full of freebies if you happen to have a lot of lead time before your book like you've got three
5:50
to six months before your book is coming out and you're still writing it or you're still getting ready to launch it then you have plenty of time to start to
5:57
build your author platform so I don't recommend that you start a Facebook page
Build your author platform
6:03
and a Twitter and an Instagram and a YouTube channel and get on Wattpad and do a website like all at once
6:09
just pick the one place where you feel like you're going to show up best so for example if you're really great on video
6:15
and you have really good energy and you already have all the equipment you need go ahead and try youtube channel just
6:21
know and understand how much time goes into promoting YouTube videos or if you
6:27
are really great at taking gorgeous photographs and writing catchy captions that mean something to people then start
6:34
an Instagram account but whatever you do choose one place where you feel like you're going to show up really well
6:39
learn on how to engage with people start to build a community there and that will
6:44
begin to grow your author platform even if it ends up just being 25 or 50 people
6:51
who are following you over the next few months that is your launch group that is your people that are going to be ready
6:57
to support you when that book comes out and that is better than starting from zero another tip for launching your book
7:03
is to tease your release before it starts coming out so whether that's like
Tease your release Description
7:09
a week from now or it's six months from now if you have that author platform set
7:14
up and you have a blog or a website set up go ahead and start telling people hey I'm a new romance author I've got this
7:21
amazing new book that's coming out hopefully sometime before the end of the year start filling people in on what's
7:28
happening in your world what's your process what other types of authors you like Google content marketing and then
7:34
start doing that as often as you can that is another great way to start not only building a platform for yourself
7:41
but also getting your name out there and letting people know that hey you've got a book coming out and then you can
7:48
springboard that to a lot of these other tips so having a website first of all is
7:53
another great thing to have so even if you're posting on Instagram you can also send people from Instagram over to your
8:00
website where you're blogging about your process or about your book release that's coming up so part of teasing it
8:07
ahead of time could be creating countdown images where you say two weeks till release or five days three to one
8:13
and you could also make images throughout that are just like teaser Tuesday so for the next six months you
DAYS
8:20
have some kind of graphic that you've done that matches the branding of the genre that you're writing and has maybe
8:26
a quote or something about one of the characters or who they are and you're letting people know every single Tuesday
8:32
on your Facebook page for example something about this book or a little bit of a quote from one of your chapters
8:39
that gets their interest up a little bit and gets them interested it just keeps your book and your process top of mind
8:46
so that they keep coming back to read more teasers another idea for teasing ahead of time is to post teasers or even
8:53
Sam all chapters on your blog or in your newsletter so if you already go ahead and get your newsletter started a head
9:00
of time before you've actually launched your book then that's going to help you launch your book even stronger so that's
9:06
my next tip for you is to go ahead and set up a newsletter you can get free newsletters at multiple places so I'll
Set up your newsletter ahead of time
9:13
link a few of them down below so until you have maybe a thousand subscribers it's going to be totally free but having
9:20
that newsletter already set up gives you a place to collect email addresses now if you're posting on Instagram you know
9:27
as well as I do that even if you have a thousand followers and you make a post about your new release only a very small
9:33
percentage maybe 10% of those followers or less are going to actually see that
9:38
post however if you have a mailing list of a thousand people and you send out an
9:44
email that says the new book has launched probably you're going to get more like 30 to 60% of them are going to
9:50
see and open that email so a newsletter is extremely important when it comes to launching and you can go ahead and start
9:58
growing it even if it's very slowly one subscriber at a time before you even launched your book so you have that
10:05
social media platform if you encourage people say get the latest teaser of my
10:10
book or see the latest behind the scenes for my author career or how the book is going get these updates sign up for my
10:17
newsletter list you can put links on your Facebook page in your link and bio on Instagram and all over the web and
10:24
people will start joining your list so this is a great way to go ahead and get people engaged with you so that when you
10:31
launch that book you've got an audience to do so the same thing goes for when
10:36
you have multiple books out if you put something in the back of each book that says if you loved this book and you want
10:43
news for when the next book comes out sign up for my newsletter list when they sign up now you've got a place to let
10:50
them know that book 2 is coming out that is one of the most important things that Indies need to have is that newsletter
10:56
list so I recommend setting it up as soon as you know your book is coming out another thing you can do to start
11:01
building up buzz and to launch your book really well is to plan a fun cover reveal readers love to see the cover of
Plan a fun cover reveal
11:08
a book especially if they've been hearing about it for the past few months oh they know you're working on it you're they're getting excited about it they've
11:14
seen all these teasers you can also tease them about the book cover is coming you can also use this as a way to
11:21
get them onto your newsletter list so if you've been teasing your book release and the fact that you've got a book
11:27
coming out you can say to them be the first to see my brand-new cover for XYZ
11:32
book sign up for my newsletter you will get it a week before everyone else then you do an exclusive cover reveal to your
11:39
newsletter subscribers only and then to the rest of the public maybe a couple days or a week later this gives people
11:47
incentive to sign up for your list then when you reveal your cover on social media you can do it in a fun way if
11:54
you'd like there are lots of ideas of how to do this but just a couple of them are to create a sort of puzzle piece of
12:00
your book cover in canva where you're just showing maybe at the top right corner of the book or the bottom left
12:06
corner of the book or just a little piece in the middle so you're showing them pieces of the cover but not the whole yet over the course of say five to
12:13
seven days and then on the seventh day boom there's the whole cover and it's something fun that people can see and
12:19
you can even engage them with posts of like what do you think is hidden over here in the corner and that sort of
12:24
thing some other ideas for a fun cover reveal would be to create free digital wallpapers that you can post on your
12:31
blog so that when you reveal the cover you can say come get a free desktop wallpaper to put on your computer or a
12:36
free phone wallpaper that you can post on your phone and then have them take a screenshot post it in your Facebook
12:42
group then if they show like with a screenshot that they've got your book cover as their desktop wallpaper or
12:49
whatever you can enter them into some kind of contest to win a $5 Amazon gift card or a free copy of the e-book when
12:58
it comes out that kind of thing you can also encourage people to change their profile pic on Facebook to your book
13:04
cover so there's lots of fun things you can do so if you want more information on fun cover reveal ideas let me know in
13:11
the comments another tip for great book launches are to give away arcs so I've had a lot of questions about what's the
Set up an ARC team
13:17
difference between a beta reader and an R reader so a beta reader is someone who's going to read your book in advance and
13:23
actually give you feedback so that you can change your book they're kind of like an editor to a degree they're
13:29
giving you feedback on what works and what doesn't work in your story arc readers are just advanced reviewers so
13:36
these are people that you've selected to get your book in advance so that on launch day they will leave a review so
13:43
they're basically getting a free copy of your book in exchange for leaving that review reviews are extremely important
13:49
so as many reviews as you can get during your launch week the better this is another reason to go ahead and have that
13:56
author platform before you launch your book because this is where you're going to find your advanced readers you can
14:02
post in facebook groups and things like that but you're really going to find your best and most quality advanced
14:08
reviews from your own community so go ahead and start building that community
14:13
up through Facebook Instagram or whatever platform of your choice so that when you're getting close to the
14:19
book coming out a few weeks in advance you can say hey who is interested in
14:25
getting an arc of this book and will read it in advance for exchange of a
14:30
review on release day some people will do this months in advance some people will just do it the week before it's
14:36
really up to you how far in advance just keep in mind that if you do it really far in advance you might end up with
14:41
some people that will send your book and pirate it so I try not to do this too far in advance personally but that's
14:48
just a personal choice another place that you can ask about arcs is books to
14:54
Gram accounts so if you are on Instagram there are lots of books to grammars out there who make beautiful photos and
15:01
really do promote books really well so if that is your jam and Instagram is
15:06
your platform reach out to books to grammars be very kind and understanding even if they don't have time to respond
15:12
to you and offer them a free copy of your book in exchange for a review and an Instagram post my next tip is to
15:19
cross-promote with other authors in your chosen genre so again another reason to
Cross promote with similar authors
15:26
go ahead and start getting into the author community the reader community wherever it is you like to interact it
15:32
does matter if it's Twitter or Instagram or Facebook wherever you happen to show up
15:37
best wherever you're building that platform for yourself reach out to other authors especially if they're writing
15:43
what you write now this comes with a caveat because I do know lots of young
15:49
authors will sometimes think sky's the limit I'll reach out to these famous
15:54
traditionally published authors or these really like hi best-selling New York Times best-selling indie authors and
16:00
then they'll get very mad if those people don't respond to them just keep in mind that authors are super busy so
16:06
you can send out a lot of requests for cross promotion and the majority of people are not going to respond to you
16:12
the best way to get cross promotion is not to just send out a bunch of emails to famous authors the best way to get
16:19
cross promotion is to get involved in the community and get involved in Facebook groups of other authors who write similar things to you and then
16:25
start talking to them and the more you get to know them any more friends you start to make then you're going to have
16:31
authentic connections where you can say hey I've got a book release coming out would you mind promoting it to your
16:37
newsletter list and then when you have a release I'll promote to my newsletter list you could even do a Facebook event
16:43
or an Instagram event you could do a cross-promotion on YouTube or wherever your platform for your readers is but it
16:51
takes that authentic communication you're going to have so much more success with this if this is someone
16:57
that you've actually spoken to outside of asking them for help but the more communities you join and get really
17:03
involved with the more likely you are to meet people that will be great to cross-promote with I would not recommend
17:08
that you cross promote with someone who's a friend that's writing in a totally different genre so if you're writing young adult paranormal it's not
17:16
going to do you any good and actually it will harm you to cross-promote with your friend that writes adult psychological
17:22
thrillers those two things are not going to mesh well and you really want for your sails to reflect people who like
17:29
reading the kinds of books that you write so only cross promote with writers who write in the same or similar genre
17:36
to you another thing that you can do is to create and advertise a lead magnet so
Create a lead magnet
17:42
I won't go too deep into this if you want to see deeper videos on any of these topics please let me know
17:47
or join my mailing list so that you'll know when my course publish and thrive reopens this fall because we do go
17:54
deeper into a lot of this stuff as well as the basics of self-publishing in that course a lead magnet is basically something
18:01
that you're going to offer for free that attracts readers to your newsletter list
18:06
so it could be let's say this is book one of my beautiful demon series my shadow demon saga I could write a
18:14
prequel to this or another type of side story or I could even just package up
18:20
the first three to five chapters and offer that for free as a lead magnet on my blog or my author platform so here I
18:28
am on YouTube let's say my author platform is here on YouTube I could let you guys know hey download the prequel
18:33
to my upcoming book and get to know these characters ahead of time get it for free all you have to do is sign up
18:39
for my newsletter list you can promote it on your own platform you can ask other authors that are your friends in a
18:46
similar genre same of that cross promo to help get the word out about your lead magnet your free thing that you're
18:52
offering in exchange for signing up for your newsletter list you can also use a service kind of like book funnel and
18:58
there are other types of services out there like that where readers are looking for free ebooks and they'll sign
19:04
up for your newsletter list in exchange for that free look free book just be
19:09
aware that in terms of your newsletter list those are kind of like cold leads
19:14
there are people that are interested in your book they want to get it for free but they're not people who have already
19:20
read your book so it's up to you to decide whether or not you want to get people on your list that have not yet
19:26
read it and are just looking for that free book it's a it's a numbers game so again I could talk about this more in
19:32
the future if you'd like you could even create a landing page on your website for your new book that you could be
19:39
advertising the new book and say want to get the first couple chapters for free and get a sneak peak and sign up for my
19:45
newsletter here so you kind of get the idea of what I'm saying you could even go so far as to take out Facebook ads or
19:51
Instagram ads for your upcoming book or for your lead magnet so let's say I have
19:57
a prequel to beautiful demons that's coming out in October I could go ahead and start now in May to let people know
20:04
about that free prequel novel or novella that they can sign up for so I could be
20:10
running Facebook Ads telling people sign up for this free book and then once they get on my newsletter list and they
20:16
already liked these characters they're primed for when this book releases they're ready to buy it when they get
20:22
their new release notification another tip for new releases and for really launching that book is to spend some
20:29
time creating sorry you can hear the baby upstairs is to spend some time creating a hook or a cool catchy tagline
20:37
for your book so think about something that's really short just a punchy one-liner I do have a video on creating
Write a catchy tagline for your book
20:45
these so look for that down below that you can use in advertising and whenever someone asks you like what's your book
20:51
about you have what some people would call an elevator pitch which might be a couple of lines or you just have that
20:57
one hook sentence that tagline that you can use in advertising you could use on
21:03
teasers so just since we're talking about my book beautiful demons I had several of these so I spent an entire
21:09
like afternoon brainstorming teasers for this or hooks for this or taglines so
21:15
some of the ones I came up with were dark secrets hide within because you've got the house in the background so dark
21:22
secrets hide within another one I used was this small town has a big secret
21:27
and the third one and most popular one that I used was never trust the popular
21:32
girls and these are things that I used in advertising they were things I used on my blog posts to really get people's
21:39
interest so take the time to come up with that great tagline that's gonna make people go ooh what's that about
21:45
that looks really interesting some other release day things that you can do is you can set up a blog tour or release
21:52
blitz now there are depending on your genre companies out there like blog tour
Run a blog tour or release blitz
21:58
companies that will help you or PR companies that will help you set up a blog tour blitz so this could be that
22:05
you did some extra blog posts they're going to send out to different people it could also just be that you know 50 or
22:12
blogs out there that our book bloggers are going to announce your release with all the links and you just pay like $100
22:19
or something to get this big blitz these types of things used to be a lot more effective back probably in like 2012 or
22:28
2013 and before they're not as effective in most Shon rescind 2020
22:33
maybe romance maybe a few other things but it doesn't mean they're not worthwhile especially if you're just
22:39
starting out so maybe ask around I don't really have anyone that I recommend off the bat but if you ask around you might
22:45
be able to find and if you know a great book blog tour or PR company go ahead and put it down in the comments below
22:51
and help your fellow authors out but this is another way that you can actually pay for kind of a blitz where
22:56
you have a hundred different blogs mentioning your book on release week and that can help to boost your sales and
23:02
visibility you might also consider having an online release party so let's say your platform is a Facebook group
Throw an online release party
23:09
and you have a hundred members in your Facebook group you could let them know in advance that next week on Monday when
23:15
my book launches we're going to have an online release party and you can create all kinds of events you can do a gift
23:22
party where everybody has to put their favorite celebration gift in the comments you could do some giveaways you
23:28
could talk about your favorite movies that are similar to teen books you could just come up with maybe 10 or 15 posts
23:35
that you'll post throughout the day you can also get other authors involved so this is where the cross promotion comes
23:41
in that you say hey invite your friends into your Facebook group as administrators or moderators and see if
23:47
they'll do some posts for a couple of hours and do some giveaways of their own books and this is a great way to
23:53
cross-promote but also get people excited about the book then they're going to be seeing those Facebook posts
23:58
come through all day long and they're going to be like oh yeah I got to buy that book so that can be a fun way to
24:04
promote the launch I personally have been doing three lives this week Monday
24:10
Wednesday and I will have one today at 4 p.m. where I am having an online release
24:15
and launch party I've been doing giveaways Q&A is coffee chat it's just been a lot of fun we also did at the end
24:21
of this reading where people got to know the witches key we kind of had a finale party for the last episode of
24:28
the witches key and we did moondust cupcake there's a cafe in the book where
24:34
they sell these cupcakes and so we had special recipes and everybody posted online with their cupcakes and they
24:40
brought them to the party they also brought their favorite coffee drink to the party and we dressed up like in
24:46
which he clothes and different things like that so you can do fun things like that and have people share their images
24:52
this works particularly well either here on youtube or on Facebook and Instagram and you can create your own special
24:58
hashtag for your release another idea is to come up with special launch pricing
25:04
now this is a place where you really need to decide remember I was talking about that checklist and coming up with
Special launch pricing
25:10
what's gonna work for you and what isn't if your goal is to make as much money as you can because you really need the
25:16
money to pay for edits and cover art for your next book then you might not want to do a special launch price however if
25:23
your main goal is just to get as many people into your book as possible and you don't mind if you lose a little bit
25:29
of money on your release week or if you just don't make a lot of money on release week you might run a $0.99 sale
25:35
that's what I did with my first actual two books I offer them at $0.99 then
25:40
when book 3 came out I had a really strong following at a full price book so it's up to you if you want to do a
25:47
launch strategy or a launch pricing my biggest warning about this is if you're going to offer a special discounted
25:54
price at launch offer it for everybody who is first in line some authors have
25:59
gotten in trouble by having like a three or four ninety nine book and then the week after launch when sales were
26:05
getting lower they dropped the price to $0.99 it sounds really cool because it's going to boost your book up and ranking
26:11
however it really is terrible for the people that were your most loyal fans that bought that book at $4.99 and now
26:18
feel like you kind of screwed them because you dropped the price and now they're going to be thinking well I'm
26:23
never buying her books at full price ever again I'm going to wait for the sale so if you're going to do a launch price make sure that is the price at
26:30
launch or pre-order and then you raise the price later instead of dropping it and a launch special launch price
26:37
doesn't have to be all the way down to 99 says if your normal price is gonna be $4.99 you could tell people it's gonna
26:44
be $1 off it's only 399 for launch week grab it now before it goes up in price another thing you can do is actually
26:50
advertise your release so there are different newsletter subscribe subscriptions out there that will
Advertise your new release
26:57
advertise your new release like I think choosy bookworm is one there are multiple and I don't have a list of them
27:04
here with me now but there are multiple ones so you can do some research on your own to find different newsletter places
27:10
that have newsletters of book buyers that are willing to promote your book to their readers one of the biggest of
27:17
course is book club so when you've got a new book coming out you might have to wait until after the book is out but
27:24
then you can claim your book author dashboard where a book bub will actually send out new release announcements but
27:31
when you're just getting started you might not have a following yet on book bub but you can pay book bub to send out
27:38
a new release alert in your genre so for example I had a new young adult book
27:43
coming out I could pay but bub I don't know how much it is say $100 to send my
27:50
book out as guess what there's this new release from a new author to all of they're like 75 thousand or hundred
27:56
thousand followers in the young adult genre it could be a lot more than that I'm not sure you can always advertise as
28:03
well on Facebook ads or you can advertise on AMS which is Amazon marking services this is something that can get
28:10
expensive super fast and you're going to need to do your research and learn how to set these ads up but this is
28:16
definitely a way that you can spend money to gain visibility for your new release if this is not your first book
28:23
so let's say since I've got this book right here I'm using it as an example so this series for me has 10 books when I
28:30
launch book 11 in the series I will promote book 11 to my current fans that
28:36
I know are already reading this series but the second part of my launch plan is going to be to drive new people to the
28:42
very first book in the series because I want to always have new people coming in to that first book this book is free
28:50
always not paperback but in eBook it's free and I my first three books are free because it's such a long series and the first
28:57
few books are really short as you can see so I offer the first three books as a loss leader and every time I have a
29:04
new release in that series I promote the heck out of the first three free books I
29:09
promote these much more than I do my new release because my new release the fans
29:14
that are loyal to that series are going to want to pick it up so my main job is to let them know that the book is here
29:19
so I do all of that stuff I was talking about cross promotion advertising cover
29:25
reveals all of that stuff to let current fans know the book is coming lost leader however like a first book free or
29:31
dropping the first book to $0.99 is a great way to bring in new readers to
29:36
your series so that you're always growing that audience this next tip is one that seems super easy but you
29:42
wouldn't believe how many authors overlook this make sure that you add your new release everywhere you can so
Post links to your new release
29:50
put it on Goodreads make sure that you let people know the new cover so that they can add it to their TBR list add it
29:56
to your actual website where you have a page that is dedicated to that book with
30:02
all the link where they can buy it then you want to make sure that if you're posting on Instagram or you're posting
30:07
on Facebook wherever you're at author platform is that you let people know and post on social media where that book can
30:14
be bought a lot of times I will see authors even authors who are wide just post their link to Amazon but if you're
30:22
selling your book at Apple Books and Barnes & Noble and Google Play and Kobo you've got to include those links too so
30:28
make sure that you're putting your links to buy and make it super easy for readers to find it put it on your
30:35
website put it on your blog put it on your home page so it's super easy it's really nice to find it put it in your
30:41
Instagram link and bio make sure you put it on your Facebook page or whatever social media you have add it to
30:48
Goodreads add it to your author page at Amazon make sure that you make it easy for readers that want to buy your book
30:55
to figure out where and how to buy it another simple tip is to have no shame
31:00
in promoting it to your friends and family especially if you're just getting started
Don't forget to tell friends & family
31:06
no a lot of us can be like oh you know I don't want to bother people but when you're just getting started this is your
31:12
audience you may have a small author platform but your family and your closest friends want to support you too
31:18
and there is no shame and going to them and saying hey my very first book has just come out I would love for you to go
31:24
and grab it and support me so if you're just getting started don't forget the value of asking friends and family to go
31:31
pick up that book now there are some rules just as a caveat on Amazon against your friends or a close family member
31:38
leaving a review for your book so I would avoid that to not get in trouble but they can certainly buy it and
31:44
support you in that way these last two tips are not so much about how you can market your launch but
31:50
instead more about how you can handle your launch emotionally so one of the
31:56
final tips I have for you is don't compare yourself to other authors so often we are looking at numbers we're
Don't compare yourself to others
32:02
looking at rankings and reviews and we're looking at other people maybe people who have 10 or 20 books out and
32:09
we're seeing ourselves in comparison and we're thinking oh man I'm never gonna have that and I really suck and my
32:14
launch didn't go really well or you see somebody in a Facebook group talking about how they made $15,000 but their
32:20
very first book you know then you compare yourself to that and you have this launch that you feel like it's very
32:25
small because you only sold 29 copies of your book and it can lead to not only a
32:31
negative spiral emotionally but it can lead to bitterness in your career where
32:36
the truth is most of those people who are saying things like I made $15,000 on my first book ever are doing something
32:43
extra like spending $15,000 on Facebook ads very few people just come right out
32:49
of the bat as an indie with their very first book and make tens of thousands of dollars not unless they've done extreme
32:56
amounts of marketing or they've spent a lot of time building up their author platform if you have a large author
33:03
platform you can launch bigger than someone who doesn't have an author platform so it's up to you how much time
33:09
you want to spend and how much money and energy you want to spend setting that up before you get started I spent no time
33:15
in energy nobody knew who I was I just put that book out there told my friends and family and kept writing as
33:22
each book came out I grew a little bit and a little bit more some people go a
33:28
different route and they will spend fifteen or twenty thousand dollars getting that book release ready to go or
33:33
they'll spend three years on their YouTube channel getting ready for their launch there is no right or wrong way so
33:40
stop comparing yourself trust me it is going to lead to nothing but negativity
33:45
and bitterness you are doing great just as you are whether you sold 10 books or a thousand
33:51
books on your launch you're doing great and you can always build from where you are comparison is gonna do nothing but slow
33:57
you down the final tip is to have fun with it you have spent your whole life wanting to write a book or a series of
34:04
books you've wanted to be an author you've wanted to build this up and really whether this is a new dream for
34:10
you or a dream you've had since childhood you are doing it and if you've made it to the point where you're
34:16
launching a book oh my gosh you should be so proud of yourself that is huge and
34:22
that is farther than the majority of people get who want to write a book so you made it that far now it's time to
34:28
just have fun with it don't put any pressure on it see it as a learning process and truthfully there is
34:34
no failure in this there's just learning more and more lessons it's really an
34:39
iterative process you're gonna try things you're gonna get the book launch out there maybe you'll be extremely
34:45
successful beyond your wildest dreams on your first launch or maybe you'll sell 10 books but celebrate those 10 books
34:51
because 10 books is a huge accomplishment it's so much better than never having finished your book and
34:58
never putting yourself out there so the next thing you do is focus on the next book and then selling 10 or 15 copies of
35:04
that one then the next book and selling 50 or 100 it's okay to grow slowly and
35:10
it's okay to really have fun with it and to celebrate each and every sale that
35:15
comes in even after ten years of publishing almost in October it'll be
35:20
ten years when I put this book out on Tuesday it was just so life-affirming to
35:27
even see you know five ten sales coming in the because it was like oh my gosh after a
35:33
year and a half of being away and several people telling me oh you're gonna ruin your career by taking a break
35:39
Indy's can't take a break I was a little bit nervous and scared about putting this next book out especially because it
35:45
was the first book in a new series and it did phenomenal it was number one at
35:51
Apple in my category it was had the number one new release flag on Amazon I sold well over 500 copies right there in
35:59
pre-order before the book even came out and it's just continuing to do really well and even though I'm not at the
36:07
level where I was two years ago because I've had this lag I'm not getting depressed about that I'm not letting
36:13
that get me down because you know what I still have that loyal following and I will be grateful for every single sale
36:20
that comes in because that is a reader that took a chance on me that is there to support me and that hopefully I am
36:26
supporting them by giving them a great fun book to read so have fun with it keep a positive attitude and keep
36:33
learning as you go alright guys long video and there is so much more I could say about each one of these points so
36:40

in my next video bye [Music]

hey everybody I am here today to talk to
0:02
you about how I track my time using a
0:05
color-coded system today I'm going to
0:11
show you how I use the Emily Leigh
0:13
simplified planner this is an o-ring
0:16
bound planner so you can't remove pages
0:20
in and out of it it is about the same
0:22
size as my travelers notebook like kind
0:25
of an a5 size
0:27
let me look let's see I have I don't
0:29
have my travelers notebook here with me
0:30
but I do have my old Filofax so you can
0:33
see this is an a5 file at the back so it
0:35
is about the same size as a 5 but you
0:39
couldn't really put this into a
0:41
traveler's notebook because it's a
0:42
little bit too bulky but this my
0:44
travelers notebook goes with me
0:46
everywhere
0:47
whereas this simplified planner pretty
0:49
much sits on my main work desk all the
0:51
time so there's you know just a little
0:54
bit of a difference but you you don't
0:55
need to have necessarily a separate
0:57
planner from what you're already using
0:59
you can do this inside your main planner
1:01
I just wanted something that I could do
1:05
only time tracking in so that I could
1:08
really quickly see at a glance what was
1:10
different in terms of where I spent my
1:12
time today I'm really going through this
1:15
period of time right now where I'm
1:16
trying to focus my time in on where
1:19
exactly is the best you know place to
1:22
spend my time figure out where I'm
1:23
wasting a lot of time and so I've wanted
1:26
to have a specific planner for that now
1:28
the reason that I chose the Emily Leigh
1:30
simplified planner simplified planner
1:32
sorry that's kind of hard to say is
1:34
because everything color coordinates
1:36
you've got what she calls the happy
1:37
stripe this is one of the covers that
1:39
you can get the pin matches the the
1:42
different stickers all matched there's
1:43
matching washi tape everything matches
1:45
and I just thought that is gonna make
1:47
things so much easier for me right now
1:49
but of course you don't have to do that
1:51
if you're using a hobo Nietzsche or an
1:53
Erin Condren or a happy planner you can
1:55
do all of these same things in that
1:57
regular planner but what you are going
1:59
to need is either stickers like this
2:03
like these round stickers that you can
2:05
use to color code or you're going to
2:07
need to use you find like some pins that
2:10
you
2:10
can use with your color code on them
2:13
either way I like having the washi and
2:16
different things that I can you know use
2:18
like these stickers but it you you don't
2:21
have to like I said use the Emily lay
2:23
ones actually down here in my drawer
2:27
down below I have several other types of
2:29
stickers that I've used for color coding
2:31
I got these off of Amazon so I can link
2:33
those below they're more like pastel
2:35
dots and then these are from these
2:38
teacher created resources and these are
2:41
more brightly colored I use these a lot
2:43
for my point of view stuff so like when
2:47
I'm plotting I'll use these but there's
2:49
lots of other ways that you can get even
2:51
in the target dollar spot like when
2:53
school comes back they'll have things
2:55
like this like these stars that are
2:58
color coded so any kind of stickers that
3:00
you can use to have a system is great so
3:03
it doesn't have to be these you could
3:05
you know get them off of Etsy or a
3:07
million other places so just anything
3:10
that you can use to color code and then
3:12
you're gonna need to start working on
3:13
the things that you want to track that's
3:16
probably one of the hardest things to
3:18
get started is figuring out how you want
3:20
to separate your time and how you want
3:22
to track it so I spent since I have all
3:25
these different colors I spent some time
3:27
really thinking about how I wanted to
3:29
block off my time and actually one of my
3:31
stickers just come off so I'm gonna put
3:34
any one on there so here's what I found
3:38
about the Emily life system she has
3:41
several different shades of like a blue
3:43
blue or teal color then she has green
3:45
yellow and then several shades of pink
3:48
so what I decided to do was use that to
3:51
my advantage so I have sort of two
3:54
focuses right now in my business one
3:56
being this new website and youtube
3:58
channel which is heart breathing's so
4:00
everything that's related to heart
4:01
breathing's is in pink so I took the
4:04
dark pink and made that my heart
4:06
breathing's marketing and admin time so
4:08
that's anything I'm doing which is you
4:11
know marketing the channel posting or
4:13
reposting to Pinterest posting this on
4:16
Facebook or interacting on Facebook
4:18
admin things like updating my website
4:21
that sort of stuff then the lighter
4:23
middle
4:24
is course content creation or I'm
4:28
working on a workshop or course on
4:31
self-publishing and how to build a
4:33
best-selling series so time that I spend
4:35
working on that course and creating
4:37
content for the course is in pink that's
4:41
the middle size middle color pink I hope
4:43
that the different colors are showing up
4:44
okay on video then the very lightest
4:47
pink is blog content creation which is
4:49
like this video for YouTube anytime I'm
4:51
working on videos or actual you you know
4:56
posts for my website or any of the
4:58
images that go on my website that
5:00
accompany my blog posts or go into the
5:03
marketing side of things I use that
5:05
light light pink then totally different
5:08
color yellow I use that for meetings
5:10
which is like I have an accountability
5:13
partner that is in a completely
5:15
different business for me so we talked
5:17
about what we plan to get done and how
5:19
we're gonna do things for our 90-day
5:20
year plan so I meet with her once a week
5:22
I also have a business mentor that I
5:24
meet with every once in a while I have
5:26
Facebook groups that I you know get
5:29
information from in terms of how the
5:31
business is going and how sales are
5:33
going for everybody kind of across the
5:35
board in in the writing community and
5:37
indie community also networking which is
5:39
going through and like you know talking
5:41
to other people that I might have met
5:44
through a thumbin up like a seminar or a
5:47
you know their Facebook group that I
5:49
want to network with for some reason so
5:51
yellow is that kind of like Facebook
5:52
group meeting time networking time dark
5:56
green is professional development for me
5:58
which is any kind of courses that I'm
5:59
taking or if I'm reading books on
6:01
writing I feel like I'm kind of you know
6:04
always in search of better ways to plot
6:07
better ways to figure out my characters
6:10
better ways to strengthen you know
6:15
characterization and then there's also
6:17
all the business books that I like to
6:19
read and things about like standing out
6:21
and how to be a better entrepreneur and
6:23
how to run my business
6:24
so that's professional development I
6:25
also take have taken several courses
6:27
like b-school and some other things like
6:29
that so anytime I'm taking courses or
6:32
I'm reading for developing my abilities
6:35
as an author or as an entrepreneur
6:37
nor I mark that in dark green then
6:41
everything that is in this sort of blue
6:44
teal spectrum has to do with my Sarah
6:47
Canon author career so the lightest blue
6:50
is outlining if I'm working on plot the
6:53
next color blue is for words like when
6:56
I'm actually sprinting and writing words
6:57
and then the sort of darker teal color
7:00
is for edits so if I'm working on
7:02
editing a book and then the navy blue
7:04
color is for my Farah Canon marketing
7:07
and admin work which is stuff like
7:09
posting to my coven which is my fan
7:12
group or coming up with promotions that
7:15
I'm going to do on a certain thing or
7:17
from uploading books or changing back
7:18
men or any of that kind of stuff like
7:20
working on paperbacks or whatever that
7:22
whole goes for dark blue so one of the
7:25
time like main things that you'll need
7:26
to do if you want to start tracking your
7:28
time to a color code system it's come up
7:30
with what colors you want to use you can
7:33
be inspired like I was by a sheet that
7:35
is readily available of different colors
7:37
or you can use like I said you can grab
7:40
you know packs of pins that have lots of
7:42
different colors and you can create your
7:43
own color code system from a set of pins
7:46
just the hardest part is figuring out
7:48
exactly what you want to track you don't
7:50
have to get you know I'm tracking one
7:52
two three four five six seven eight nine
7:54
I'm tracking nine different things you
7:56
don't attract that many you could just
7:58
track you know like writing marketing
8:01
and editing with the Emily Leigh planner
8:04
on her site she also has some of these
8:06
other stickers so like these boxes that
8:09
are the same colors the flags and then
8:12
some of these just playing icons and
8:14
then she has the washi tape which you
8:16
can see it doesn't come in all the
8:17
different colors that I'm using for time
8:19
tracking but that's okay because I only
8:21
really need the dots okay so here is an
8:25
example of a couple of weeks ago when I
8:28
was really using it really great so what
8:30
I would do is I go in and I mark the
8:32
night before exactly what I want to get
8:35
done the next day so I wanted to plan my
8:37
social media for the week create images
8:39
for Sarah cannon create images for heart
8:42
breathing so usually when I'm saying
8:43
create images I mean probably for
8:46
Instagram or something like that then I
8:48
want to make some checklists I want to
8:50
do miracle more
8:51
get up early in the morning and do
8:53
miracle morning set up projects in a
8:55
sauna edit episode 1 of my book
8:57
sacrifice me outline and reading part of
9:00
sacrifice me one Finnish heart
9:02
breathing's website record how I use my
9:05
hope Andy she has a writer and record a
9:07
video on plotting those so I had the
9:09
plans to do all of this stuff and then
9:12
what I did was I will fill out I'll put
9:14
a little flag down here because I do
9:16
what's called theme days so for me
9:19
Monday's is usually focused on social
9:22
media or admin tasks for Sarah cannon so
9:25
I've used that dark blue which is the
9:27
same dark blue I use here then on
9:29
Tuesdays my focus is usually heart
9:32
breathing content creation be it course
9:34
content or blog content then I on
9:39
Wednesdays I go to Barnes & Noble so I
9:41
try to use that day for creating like
9:43
that day focus is usually Sarah cannon
9:46
writing just rough draft work or editing
9:49
and then I focus on meetings because I
9:51
have those meetings on Thursdays every
9:52
time and then on Fridays I focus on
9:55
professional development in any courses
9:57
that I might want to be taking so I've
9:59
had themed days now themed days doesn't
10:01
mean that I don't write every day
10:04
because I do tend to try to write every
10:06
morning and then in the afternoon that's
10:08
where I spend my themed daytime what I
10:11
did was I wrote down I started writing
10:13
down what workday begins 808 so I was
10:16
planning to sit down at 8 a.m. but I
10:18
didn't sit down until 8:00 away and I
10:20
made that mark then every single time
10:23
like if you watched my video earlier
10:25
this week on Pomodoro tracker every
10:27
single one of these dots represents a
10:30
25-minute
10:31
sprint or 25 minute Pomodoro so I
10:35
started my day working on as you can see
10:38
the navy blue dot Sarah Kane and
10:39
marketing and admin I developed I
10:41
installed this thing called rescue time
10:44
which was going to help me figure out
10:45
where I was spending my time online so
10:47
it tracks like how much time you spend
10:49
on your Facebook browser versus how much
10:51
time you spend in Chrome looking at
10:54
Google Docs so I installed that didn't
10:56
really work out so great for me because
10:57
I'm in between too many different
10:59
devices throughout the day but I did
11:01
spend some time setting that up so that
11:02
was the first 25 minute
11:04
then I spent the next one two three four
11:08
sprints working on outlines outlining
11:11
and editing sacrificed me so you can see
11:13
I took the light blue color for
11:16
outlining and then I wrote down each
11:19
sprint and how much I got done so this
11:22
was an edit so I got 315 words and then
11:24
1,300 words and so forth in my edits
11:27
done that day then I went back to Sarah
11:30
Kane and marketing and admin and I did
11:31
some YouTube research on other authors
11:34
and how they're doing you know what
11:37
they're doing with the YouTube then I
11:38
did another sprint so each time I have
11:40
an arrow it just means that I'm his same
11:42
color code I'm just doing another sprint
11:44
so I did flat late practice which is
11:47
where I was practicing some stuff for
11:49
Instagram and I was practicing taking
11:50
pictures that are called flat lays so I
11:53
did that for about 25 minutes
11:55
then at 1:00 p.m. I've got this dark
12:00
pink heart or dark pink circle which I
12:03
was doing an interview with a friend for
12:05
heart briefings to try to figure out you
12:08
know some market research for that then
12:10
at 2:00 p.m. I did a webinar which was
12:13
professional development so I've got my
12:15
green dot and then I went back and
12:17
worked on some of my social media
12:19
strategy and then I did some music for
12:21
YouTube for heart breathing's and then
12:23
at the end of the day I did those
12:25
recordings that I was planning to do so
12:26
that went to blog content creation so
12:29
this was actually a really really long
12:31
day I worked probably I mean you can see
12:33
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 and that was actually
12:37
eight nine ten eleven twelve thirteen
12:40
fourteen fifteen sixteen twenty five
12:43
minutes sprints so it was a really long
12:46
day because even with those breaks in
12:48
between I probably worked from 808 until
12:50
probably about 6 or 7 o'clock that night
12:52
and then I know I did actually go back
12:54
and do some things later in the evening
12:56
but that gives me a really good idea for
12:59
of how much I got done that day so then
13:01
the following day you can see that I
13:03
also wrote out my to-do list had my
13:07
focus for the day and I still out all of
13:08
this stuff the night before and then I
13:11
did sacrifice me to edit so I've got
13:14
that for my outlining and edits or
13:16
actually it was mostly
13:18
outlining and it was a read-through so I
13:20
didn't count that for edits I counted it
13:22
for outlining and then video editing
13:24
goes down to blog content creation and I
13:27
did that for most of the day and then
13:30
over here underneath I usually put like
13:32
a little strip of washi and I'll just
13:34
fill out some notes on what I did so
13:37
basically that is how I'm tracking my
13:39
time and I can go back and look later
13:41
and see kind of how you know at a glance
13:44
where did I spend most of my time like
13:46
was I really focused and only worked on
13:49
one thing today no I mean I worked on
13:51
one two three four five different types
13:55
of things in one day and that might have
13:58
been why it took me so long to complete
13:59
those tasks so I can take this data
14:01
later and I can go back and say you know
14:04
this day I might have gotten more done
14:05
but it took me less time because I was
14:07
only working on two separate things I
14:09
worked on sacrificed me in the morning
14:10
and then I worked on my edits in the
14:12
afternoon whereas over here on this day
14:14
I was kind of flip-flopping around I did
14:16
like a little bit of this and then hours
14:18
of this and then switched and switched
14:19
and switched and that's called context
14:21
switching and when you switch from one
14:23
thing to another and then another and
14:25
then another every time you switch what
14:27
you're working on or where your focus is
14:29
it you lose some of your productivity it
14:32
takes you time to get back into the new
14:33
task where is like over here I stayed in
14:36
this one task for most of the day so it
14:39
was much more streamlined I got a lot
14:40
more done in a less period of time
14:42
whereas here every time I switched from
14:44
doing like YouTube Tube research to
14:46
doing an interview then to doing a
14:48
webinar I was changing so much what my
14:51
focus was that I didn't focus on one any
14:53
one thing and was able wasn't able to
14:56
switch between tasks as smoothly as I
14:58
could have if I had just kept it to one
15:01
type of task so just real quick I'll
15:03
show you kind of how I will set this up
15:05
for tomorrow which is Monday March 5th I
15:09
just take this and I will I just usually
15:14
right at the beginning and I'll say work
15:16
begins at and then I will fill that out
15:22
tomorrow at whatever time I decide to
15:25
finally get out of bed and start working
15:28
then I will take one of these flags and
15:30
I will put what my theme for the
15:32
is usually Monday's is the theme is
15:36
working on my Sarah Canon marketing an
15:38
admin and that is actually what I'm
15:40
going to be working on tomorrow because
15:42
I'm working on paperbacks and backless
15:45
stuff tomorrow so I'm going to put that
15:47
there which corresponds with my color
15:48
code telling me it's Sarah Kane and
15:50
marketing and admin then I'm going to
15:52
put folk the word focus here and I'm
15:55
going to say paperbacks and back matter
16:04
so I'm going to be working on that all
16:06
afternoon
16:07
then I can put any other little notes or
16:09
to do that I have regarding that down
16:11
here at the bottom then up here on my
16:14
to-do list I know that in the morning
16:16
I'm actually going to be working on
16:18
writing so I'm going to set a goal for
16:21
myself of 5,000 words on sacrifice me
16:26
too so I'm just gonna put sm2 over here
16:28
so that's my first to do for the day
16:30
it's 5,000 words I also have you know
16:35
want to get let's say at least four
16:37
paperbacks done so I'm going to set that
16:39
as my goal and I'm gonna write SDS over
16:42
here so I know it's the shadow demon
16:43
saga and then I'm gonna say update back
16:46
matter and I'm just gonna use those same
16:50
four books as the ones that I want to
16:54
update the back matter then I do
16:56
actually want to set up a new Facebook
16:58
ad for the beautiful demons box set so
17:04
I'm going to put set up Facebook ad BD
17:07
box and then tomorrow the only other
17:10
thing that I really want to get done is
17:11
I want to post my new post on heart
17:18
breathing so that's pretty much my
17:20
entire day and it's actually a lot of
17:22
work I'm not usually color-coordinating
17:24
the washi or anything like that but I do
17:28
tend to put in some washi tape here just
17:33
to make it pretty and to have a
17:35
separation and I'll leave a few little
17:38
spaces here in case I add any to do's
17:40
and then down here at the bottom I will
17:43
write any concerns that I had
17:45
or any like little journaling that I
17:48
wanted to do about how the day went and
17:50
what I'd like to start doing is actually
17:52
down here in the notes section or maybe
17:55
up here just calculating exactly how
17:58
much time I spent on each one of these
18:00
tasks and that's just something that I'm
18:02
still work in progress so maybe I'll do
18:04
an update video in a few months if I get
18:06
better at that because what I'd like to
18:08
ideally do is you know take if I've
18:11
taken each one of these dots put the
18:13
dots here like each different color here
18:15
and then actually physically write out
18:17
like I did 1 2 3 4 sprints like this so
18:22
that means I spent for 25 minutes
18:24
sprints so that would be basically 2
18:26
hours of work so that I can just look at
18:29
a glance and say I did 2 hours to work
18:31
on Sarah can an admin I did 2 hours of
18:33
work on outlining today and so on
18:35
because I want to get much better at
18:37
tracking the time and thing where my
18:38
time is going because there's no way I
18:40
can fix you know things that I'm wasting
18:43
time on if I don't actually study and
18:45
get data on where I'm spending my time
18:47
so basically that's how I set up my time
18:51
tracking in my simplified planner and if
18:55
you have any questions please leave them
18:57
below if you have a time tracking system
18:59
that you're using I would love to hear
19:01
more about it in the comments so please
19:02
feel free to comment below or go to my
19:05
facebook page at facebook.com slash
19:07
heart breathing and leave me a picture
19:09
of what you're doing for your time
19:10
tracking this has been super helpful for
19:13
me in sort of figuring out where I'm
19:15
spending my time and being just more
19:17
aware and more deliberate on you know
19:20
what I want to do and what I want to get
19:22
done during the day because the more
19:24
deliberate and the more specific I get
19:26
the better I get about actually managing
19:28
that time rather than like giving up and
19:31
going doing something else like binge
19:33
watching something or just sitting on
19:35
the couch scrolling Facebook all day so
19:37
hopefully this will help you too and if
19:40
you did enjoy it please give this video
19:41
a thumbs up and subscribe below and I
19:44
will see you guys in my next video bye
19:58
[Music]

there's too much to do too much to do and not enough time to do it it is an
0:05
eternal problem that those of us who are authors or entrepreneurs running your own business trying to make your goals
0:11
come true in the world it's just true for all of us there's this huge list of
0:16
things that we need to be doing to move our businesses forward to see our goals come to life to get the results that we
0:22
want and we have less and less time to get it done more demands and even the
0:28
more successful you become the more demands there are on our time so what's the solution how do we get out of this
0:35
cycle of constantly feeling overwhelmed and stressed and getting behind I have
0:40
three simple steps for you today that are going to help you get out of this cycle so let's get started
0:49
foreign [Music] than not this feeling of always being
0:56
behind like you're gonna be too late like you're not getting enough done like there's just too much on your plate to
1:01
handle that you're just not following through or you're disappointing people all the time if that's you and that
1:07
resonates like you could raise your hand right now in the comments if that's you it's most likely coming from the fact
1:12
that you have more on your plate than you have time to get it all done or it
1:18
could be the fact that you are putting so much on your plate because you don't really know what's going to be the most
1:24
effective for you so you're trying everything you're watching what everyone else is doing and you're just trying a little bit of all of it and it could
1:30
also be that you're trying a lot of things and you're just not seeing the results
1:35
you want which then makes you feel a panic around what if I never see these
1:40
results what if I'm going to work this hard my whole life and never see the results that I want to see from all this
1:47
hard work so it could be any of those factors that are leading to this feeling of overwhelm so how do we solve it how
1:54
do we get out of this cycle of always feeling like we're too late we're disappointing people we're too far
1:59
behind we're never going to get it all done well I have three simple steps for you
2:05
today that will start you down the path toward healing this cycle towards feeling better and embracing more joy in
2:11
the process as you get more done and start to see your dreams come true so I'm going to give you these three steps
2:16
today and you can start implementing it right away so the first one is to match
Match Your Time & Tasks
2:22
your time with your tasks and this isn't necessarily difficult but it is
2:28
eye-opening so let me show you what I mean by this for most of us when we start planning out our day we're either
2:36
doing it in our heads and we just have this running to-do list of all the things that need to get done or for some
2:42
of us we're writing it down on a piece of paper or maybe we have it in a planner if you're extra organized or you
2:47
like that kind of thing or maybe it's in a checklist in some kind of Asana or a task list online or something like that
2:53
but a lot of times you have a general idea of all the things you want to get done
2:58
so I want you to think forward since today you might be watching this in the evening or whatever but think forward to
3:04
your next sort of busy work day it could be tomorrow it could be at the start of next week and just jot down for yourself
3:11
a list of all the things that you can think of that you need to get done and this could be your personal stuff or you
3:17
could just keep it to work stuff your goal-oriented type stuff just sit down and make a list of all the things that
3:23
you've been holding in your head or that are on your task list so just as an example it could be you know you're
3:29
going to do a YouTube video uh you're going to post to social media
3:34
maybe you're going to answer some emails maybe you have to mail something out
3:40
maybe you need to you're going to have like a zoom meeting with a partner or
3:47
you know friend or something like that maybe you also really wanting to take a
3:52
few videos of that course you wanted to do you wanted to exercise maybe you gotta make sure you clean the kitchen
3:58
and you got to get that laundry done and this doesn't even include the fact
4:06
that you have to pick the kids up or that you've got to take your dad into his appointment or you know all these
4:11
other things so let's say you make this list of all the things you want to get done when most of us are planning our
4:19
day it's either happening in our head or on a list somewhere and we just think
4:24
about the things that need to get done it's a rare person among us and that
4:31
really stops and thinks about how long each of these things is going to take but what happens for so many of us is we
4:39
have the list and then at the end of the day we feel like we worked all day we've
4:45
exhausted ourselves and maybe only three things on this list are actually checked off and for most of us it's a rare day
4:51
that we actually got through everything we intended to get through and when you stack day after day after day that you
4:59
only get a small portion of your work done it can start to feel overwhelming because you can say to yourself oh my
5:05
gosh I worked as hard as I could I'm hustling I'm working to the point of
5:11
almost wanting to cry some days and I still only got three things done on my list like what's wrong with me and we
5:17
blame ourselves and we actually expend a lot of our personal energy beating
5:23
ourselves up and trying to push ourselves harder and then half the things on this list get migrated into
5:28
tomorrow's list and then maybe we have five days in a row where the kitchen didn't get clean and now we feel like
5:33
we're lazy we're a slob what's wrong with us everyone else can keep their kitchen clean so if any of this sounds
5:39
familiar it might be a little too dramatic for some of you or you might have an even worse situation so we're all kind of on a spectrum with this so
5:46
what I want you to do is make that list of your next kind of busy day and all the things that you would expect yourself to get done
5:52
but then the next thing I want you to do is I want you to estimate how long you
5:58
think it will take you to actually get each of these items done to completion
6:03
to the point where you feel like you can check it off and you know ideally where
6:08
you will feel proud of the work you did not that you were rushing through it or that you were hustling or that you
6:13
didn't get it done the way you wanted but like to get it done the way that you would expect to get it done when you put it on your list now you could do this in
6:21
a number of ways but the way I like to do this is what I call task blocks
6:27
so task block is one thirty minute block
6:32
of time so you might be familiar with this that some people call it the Pomodoro method in the Pomodoro method
6:40
usually it's 25 minutes of work with a five minute break and then every four
6:46
sessions or something like that you take a longer break this is uh pairs with
6:51
that but it's not exactly the same thing so you can set it up any way you want your task block is your period of time
6:57
it could be that you work for 20 minutes and take a 10 minute break every hour or it could be that you work for four task blocks in a row before you take a break
7:03
at all it doesn't really matter the point is that a task block is a 30 minute segment of time
7:09
so that means there's two task blocks to every hour in your day so in in the
7:15
course of a day you have 48 task blocks a day of course most of those you're going to be sleeping or many of those you'll be sleeping so in this list here
7:24
if you take each item individually how long do you think it will take you to do each one and really try to not think
7:30
about how long do I wish it would take me in a perfect world if I had all the tools and all the energy in the world how long
Time Estimates
7:38
will it take me but think on a typical day for myself with the current tools the current energy the current
7:44
motivation that I have how long is it going to take me to do a good job and complete this process and you know how
7:50
long it takes you to clean the kitchen one day might be different than a different day if you have less energy but for now let's just say on an average
7:56
day how long so YouTube video sometimes when we make our lists we make just a
8:02
really big project into one item on the list whereas really these things aren't all equal because
8:09
exercising might take us 20 minutes but finishing a YouTube video might take us six hours right so these aren't always
8:16
equal and we'll talk about that later in the video but when I think about a YouTube video
8:22
I'm going to go through the process of everything I have to do to get this video completed which means maybe outlining it recording it multiple times
8:29
editing it moving the files over to a different computer you know whatever it might be uploading it to YouTube making
8:35
a newsletter list and if I want to actually check this off my list that I got it done it needs to actually be up
8:41
Live on YouTube so for me that's going to take me probably four to five hours so I'm going to say nine task blocks
8:47
which would be four and a half hours for that so try to be actually realistic and a lot of times what you'll notice is
8:54
that because you want to get everything done you try to almost convince your mind that you can do it faster than you
9:01
can but I encourage you to really be realistic here and meet yourself where you are so posting to social media maybe
9:07
that takes one task block maybe it takes you a taskbot to catch up on your email sending out mail though to actually
9:14
package that up and drive back and forth that's going to take two a zoom meeting is going to be an hour so that's two
9:19
times blocks maybe I wanted to spend an hour and a half on this course so that's three task blocks one task blocks of
9:25
exercise one task block to clean the kitchen and maybe two task blocks for laundry because I want to actually get
9:31
them folded and put away actually that might be three depending on the day but let's say you do this and you're like okay so now
9:37
I've got them all estimated but then what I want you to do is I want you to
9:43
count them all up and see how much time you're expecting yourself to work today so that's 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18
9:51
19 20 21 22 so this is 22 task blocks which if you
9:57
divide that into so that you get the hours that's 11 hours worth of work in
10:03
the day and that doesn't include any down time any time to go to the bathroom anytime to eat your meals anytime to
10:09
pick the kids up from school or to go outside and take a walk is this realistic for you most days that you
10:15
could actually get 11 hours worth of work in your number might be different your situation might be different but I
10:22
would bet that a lot of you if you actually followed through with this would find that you are putting more on
10:28
your plate than you can actually get done if I put 11 hours worth of work on my plate every day there's no way it
10:34
would all get done so I would end up maybe getting the video done and some emails and then everything else would be
10:40
undone and then I would think what's wrong with me that I only got two things done
10:45
and then that energy when I show up the next day and it happens again is just stacking negative momentum stacking self
10:53
I don't want to say self-loathing but kind of like self-deprecation
11:00
self-disappointment and then what about the people I didn't get to meet for the meeting and the course I promised people
11:06
and what about the way I feel when I get up and think gosh there's another day I didn't exercise and the worry that comes
11:12
along with what if I don't have a healthy heart because I'm not exercising like there's a million things or seeing
11:18
that your house isn't clean the way that you want it to be and that doesn't give you energy it makes you feel like you're not getting enough done
11:24
and when we stack enough of this constant constant expectation and
11:30
pressure with an unrealistic expectation of what we can get done and how much
11:36
time we have but we aren't actually aware of the disparity between this time that's where we end up feeling
11:42
overwhelmed out of power depressed hard on ourselves and all those things
11:48
and it's one thing to do it for one day but when you zoom out and you see that a whole week you've just been stacking
11:54
days like this where you don't actually have enough time to get it all done because you're putting too much on your plate that's where you can start to see
12:01
why you feel like your life is so difficult because it is because you're you're just setting yourself up for an
12:08
impossible scenario like there will never be more time just because you wish
12:13
it was there you will never create time just because your to-do list was long like the time is the time and you get as
12:20
much done as you can and your expectation plays a lot into how much you can actually get done now when
12:27
I plan my days I I'm a planner person so yours doesn't have to look like this and
12:32
it may not ever you may not want it to look like this this might be something that gives you anxiety but for me what
12:39
has been helping is whether you make a list like this or you put it into a planner is taking a look
12:46
at how much time do I actually have available so if it's Thursday today I
12:52
could go through my schedule and I could say where do I have time today that's not already committed so I have this
12:58
meeting here maybe I know I want to exercise here I've got to pick the kids up here where do I have time that I feel
13:04
like working on my goals that I know I can actually dedicate to it and then I identify that time on my calendar five
13:11
task blocks here three here two here and I add them up and I say okay on a typical day today I have 10 task blocks
13:18
available so instead of just making a list and expecting myself to get it all done with no awareness of how long it's
13:24
going to take I actually decide first how much time do I have today and that's the first thing I do and then I turn
13:31
around and say okay what can I get done in 10 past blocks so then when I look at this list I know this is unrealistic and
13:38
I could say what are my top priorities okay the YouTube video has to get done in that that's going to be 9 out of my
13:43
10. so what else on this list is most important for me to get done maybe it's
13:49
just to clean the kitchen maybe the kitchen's gone too long or maybe as we'll talk about in the next
13:55
part of this video maybe I can get my husband to clean the kitchen and do the laundry today and I can make sure I get
14:00
this exercise in today and these are my 10 task blocks and that's all the time I have for today but then when I finish
14:06
the day and I checked off those two most important things I'm a winner and I feel
14:12
excited and I know I chose the most important things that I made progress instead of looking at this list and
14:17
feeling like I failed or I didn't follow through or I disappointed myself yet again so one of the first things that
14:23
you can do for yourself for your mental health for your joy for your productivity and for your sustainability
14:29
in life and towards your goals is to begin to match up your time your actual available time
14:37
with the tasks that you expect yourself to get done so how many of you
Why You're Overwhelmed
14:42
immediately saw that you're putting more on your plate than you could possibly
14:48
get done in the amount of time you have this is really one of the main things that I see over and over again with
14:55
people is that instead of planning for the time that we have and being realistic about how much time things
15:01
will take we instead just focus on what needs to get done so we'll create a task
15:06
list and we'll say this is what I have to get done today and we pay no mind to
15:11
whether it's actually realistic to expect ourselves to perform all of those
15:17
tasks in a single day so what we often see is that we have let's say six or
15:22
seven hours worth of tasks once we estimate it all out but we only have two hours of free time but because we're not
15:29
actually mentally aware of that disparity we just have a list of expectations and we push ourselves as
15:36
hard as we can for those two hours and then we end up disappointed because half the things didn't get done we have them
15:42
promised we feel like it's our fault and we begin to blame ourselves and wonder why am I not seeing the results I want
15:51
and it's because we're not actually following through with the tasks that we planned to complete or if by some
15:58
miracle you actually did manage to get seven hours worth of tasks done in two hours it's likely that you were pushing
16:05
yourself Beyond a limit of what's healthy you were cutting Corners potentially you were rushing the work it
16:10
wasn't potentially filled with the joy and excitement and magnetism of really
16:16
just loving and putting your passion into your work because you had all this time pressure on your shoulders and then
16:24
over time putting seven hours worth of work into two hours day after day after day is not
16:31
sustainable even if you were skilled enough or you were able to really push yourself hard enough to get it done once
16:37
over time it begins to erode your joy your passion your health and all of
16:44
those things begin to suffer and once our joy our passion our health and our
16:49
belief in ourselves and how we feel about ourselves and the things we say about ourselves begins to deteriorate
16:55
then those two hours that we have to work every day or whatever your situation is becomes harder and harder
17:02
to get more done because we're putting so much pressure and we have so much stress like have you ever woken up one
17:09
day and you just felt so good and you realize that like you put on your headphones and you got the whole house cleaned and this got done and this got
17:15
done and this Aaron got done you were like wow that was just a really exciting focused day and you were feeling good
17:22
the whole time but then on the opposite side of that have you ever had a day where you just didn't feel good and
17:27
you're stressed and you forced yourself to get tasks done on your list and it felt like everything was taking forever
17:32
and none of it turned out any good well when we feel good when we're happy
17:38
when we're excited about what we do when we feel good we get more done and I
17:44
understand that there are some of us that can't always get to a place of feeling good because we have chronic illness or we deal with anxiety or other
17:51
things in our lives but when we pile on top of that extra stress beating
17:57
ourselves up constantly putting more on our plate than as humanly possible because we feel like we have to get it
18:02
done all we're doing is punishing ourselves and putting ourselves deeper into the whole sometimes I like to see
18:09
this as a game okay I have eight task blocks available what can I realistically get done in eight task
18:15
blocks let's make it fun and see how much I can get done rather than ah I can't get it all done there's too much
Make It A Game
18:21
match your tasks with your available time and you'll start to see that it was
18:26
never you all along there was never anything wrong with you you were just literally putting more on your plate
18:32
than you could humanly do and let me tell you many of us especially if you're an overachiever or Enneagram three like
18:38
me or you put a lot of pressure on yourself to achieve your goals you're going to find that sometimes when you
18:45
start to get realistic you have a morning period of I can't only get this done
18:51
but here's what I want you to understand and this is like a heavy truth bomb to drop here for those of you that are like
18:56
this that are like me is that you weren't getting it done anyway
19:01
you feel like you have to get it done so you put it on your plate and you push yourself and you push yourself and you push yourself but it wasn't getting done
19:08
effectively anyway so continuing to put it on your plate and feel like you have to is really just punishing yourself the
19:15
other thing is more time will not magically appear just because you feel like you need it to
19:22
it never has worked in the past and it will never work in the future you cannot continue to put seven hours worth of
19:28
work into two hours of time or a full Year's worth of work into the next three
19:33
months you can't do it it's not going to work out and it will not be sustainable and you will not be putting out your
19:40
best work and you will not be joyful through the process so I encourage you no matter how hard it is no matter how
19:46
much you feel like you have to get these things done to get realistic about your time and match up your available time
19:52
with the tasks that you're trying to get done that's step number one so now that you have this idea of matching time with
Prioritize
19:58
tasks what do we do with all those tests that aren't going to get done this is also something that can be emotionally
20:05
difficult for those of us that have chronically been putting more on our plate than we can actually get done and
20:12
who feel like it has to get done so what else do I do well this is where you
20:17
really need to sit down and write down all the things all the projects that you have currently on your your plate the
20:22
books you're planning to write the Etsy shop that you're starting the Discord server the social media all the things
20:30
that are currently in progress and you need to start looking at each one individually like the big kind of
20:36
buckets of things that you're doing your social media your promotions your Facebook ads whatever it may be for you
20:42
and start to prioritize and say what out of all this list can I delegate to
20:47
someone else what out of all this list can get pushed back to another time so I can get control of my schedule and what
20:54
are the things that really need to get done and then hopefully you've pruned your
20:59
list just a little bit because a lot of us will end up having things on our list that we feel like must get done just
21:05
because we saw someone else getting success with this and there's this feeling of fear of missing out like if
21:10
I'm not on Tick Tock what will happen because all these authors are finding success on Tick Tock and if I'm not
21:16
there what if I miss out on my big break and these are valid fears like there are
21:22
people getting big on different platforms but the truth is you can look for any example people that are finding
21:30
success with subscriptions direct sales people that are good in KU people that are publishing their books themselves
21:36
people who are publishing through Publishers there are just infinite examples of success out there and once
21:43
you start to understand that you get to create the level of success that you want that you don't have to be
21:49
everything to everyone you don't have to be everywhere all the time and you're actually more likely to find success by
21:56
focusing in on a single platform or a single strategy than you are by
22:02
spreading yourself so thin that you never actually completed anything once you start to understand that that's when
22:08
you'll start to take control of your career because like I explained in the first part of this video when you have
22:13
more on your plate then you can actually get done you may have this great strategy of I'm going to be really
22:19
active on five different social media platforms but if you don't actually
22:24
consistently post to all of them that strategy means nothing it's the follow through that helps you get to the
22:30
results so if right now with your available time you are only capable of following through with one platform then
22:37
you will get better results from that one platform than you would from being on all five now if you could be active
22:45
on all five and be super consistent sure maybe you would get better results from that but we cannot become something
22:52
we're not we cannot invent extra time we cannot push ourselves be Beyond a level
22:57
of good health and skill and capability we cannot push ourselves beyond the level of the habits and the systems that
23:04
we've already set up so if you can get yourself to this mindset of yes I had
23:09
all these plans I had all these things I wanted to do but this right here is what I'm capable of being consistent on this
23:16
is what I can say is my top priority and this is what is sustainable for me and you can practice radical self-acceptance
23:23
with that and say this is where I am and I'm going to be successful with this one
23:29
strategy instead of allowing all of the noise of everything everyone else is doing make you feel like you
23:36
have to be all those things and then failing at all of them or failing at most of them or not
23:42
following through on most of them if you can stop that and you can say this is where I'm gonna focus and I
23:48
believe in myself and make that Focus something that's sustainable for you you will literally
23:54
change your own life overnight so write down all the things that you currently
24:00
have on your plate and then start prioritizing and start matching those projects up with the time that you have
24:06
available and making sure that you're only putting on your plate what you can currently handle as you are not as some
24:13
super version of yourself not as some like I will be this person tomorrow I
24:19
know I can do it version as who you are right now in this moment with your limitations with your health with your
24:25
current time available these are the things I can do and you can always grow from there but it is very difficult to
24:31
grow from a place of I have all this pressure on my back and I'm never living
24:37
up to it instead go to a place of this is sustainable and doable for me and
24:43
then I can use that as a springboard it makes all the difference I promise third step is my favorite step which is
Micro Tasks
24:51
to take the projects that you have decided you have time and energy for and break those into tiny achievable micro
24:59
tasks if you know me at all you know that I like to put those micro tasks onto Post-it notes which I put on a
25:05
kanban board on the wall if you'd like to see that I have tons of videos here on YouTube talking about my kanban board
25:11
and how I break things down in two steps so I would encourage you to watch this video next where you're going to get a
25:17
chance to look at those kanban boards and how I use it but Post-it notes is how I do it because for me if it's out
25:24
of sight it's out of mind so for you it might be a checklist it could be something in notion it could be Trello
25:29
it could be just having a daily planner for me I like to have it in my planner
25:36
and I like to have it up on the wall and every single micro task gets a Post-It note so that when I finish it I get to
25:43
move it down the board and that makes me feel successful that I say this was a task I was meant to do today and now I
25:50
get to move it to the done section of my kanban board every kanban board that I use has a to-do section A doing section
25:57
currently in process and then a done section and getting the opportunity to just move that Post-It note that says
26:04
record the video and move it to the done section is like yes I got that done and
26:09
I feel accomplished and what happens is when we take those big projects like get
26:16
the video done or even something bigger like start a YouTube channel and we look
26:22
at how huge that feels it can often feel like we don't know where to start like
26:28
we're clueless like we don't have any control like it feels like it's such a big project I don't even know if I can
26:33
be successful it doesn't feel feel possible for us but if we take that project of starting a YouTube channel
26:38
finishing a book creating a bestseller or whatever it may be replacing my
26:44
income getting to quit my job we have these big goals but when we break those down into projects and we say Okay first
26:50
I'm going to start with finishing this book and that is going to be achievable for me and it know I know that finishing
26:56
this book leads to publishing this book leads to making money on this book but right now I'm just going to focus on
27:01
finishing this book but even finishing this book is so huge so in order to give
27:07
ourselves pleasure excitement passion and to feel like it's achievable
27:13
break that project of finishing the book into micro tasks I am going to write 500
27:19
Words put that on your board put that on your checklist and then when you get
27:25
here today and you get ready to work you sit down at your desk you say okay I've got 500 words to write it's going to
27:31
take me about 30 minutes to do it or it could be an hour or it could be 10 minutes everyone's different but you may
Pep Talk
27:36
know okay I've got 30 minutes to write I'm gonna try for this 500 words and
27:42
then you actually sit down and you get it done oh that feels so good and finishing it
27:48
moving it down checking it off is such a rush of I actually completed this so the
27:55
third piece of this puzzle once you have matched your time to your tasks you have
28:01
decided on what your priorities are and what you're going to focus on that you can honestly get done in the
28:06
time and energy you have available and then you start breaking those projects down into tiny little micro tasks that
28:13
you can complete in 30 minutes or an hour or one single session a day you
28:18
will start to own your schedule you will start to build positive momentum you will start to say nice things about
28:25
yourself because you're not setting yourself up for disappointment anymore so many of us have been setting
28:31
ourselves up every single day for disappointment we're putting a mountain
28:37
eight hours worth of work that we're trying to squeeze into an hour and then we're blaming ourselves when it doesn't
28:42
get done and we aren't even aware of it because we don't understand what we're doing to ourselves so this is your
28:48
wake-up call wake up to how much you're putting on your plate how much of it isn't even moving the needle or making
28:55
any difference in your career and is just adding stress and Punishment to your life and instead say I deserve to
29:03
be happy while I'm being productive I deserve to enjoy the process of building
29:09
my dream life step by step and so I'm going to take a look at how much time I
29:14
really have available I'm going to make sure I'm not putting more on my plate than what I can do in that amount of time and then I'm going
29:21
to break down the projects that I know I need to complete into tiny little steps that I can get done one at a time in a
29:29
single session and I am going to build positive momentum in my life I am going
29:34
to see results because I'm actually finishing projects and I'm going to be
29:39
happier and more joyful while I'm doing it I can't promise that this will eliminate
29:45
your stress for the rest of your life I can't promise that you won't have moments where you feel overwhelmed because this is part of the human
29:51
experience but if you can Embrace this process of not putting more on your plate than you can reasonably handle
29:59
and just allowing that to be enough and truly accepting yourself and creating a plan that meets you where you are and
30:05
that breaks it down into something that you feel and you know and you believe on a daily basis that you can actually
30:11
achieve and you start building and stacking wins instead of building and
30:16
stacking disappointment it will change your life so those are my three steps let me know
30:23
how it works out for you if you are interested in going into this process in even more depth where I will walk you
30:29
through every single step of how to decide what your priorities are how to take that realistic look at your time
30:34
not just across a single day but across an entire 90 days and then break those
30:40
goals down into small achievable tasks I walk you through this in my new detail
30:46
holding your hand the whole time helping you set up your goals and making sure that you have a plan that sets you up
30:51
for success and then not just supporting you through the boot camp which by the way starts this Sunday
30:58

31:09

31:16

31:21

31:27
understanding how to create a life that gives you the actual ability to be
31:35

32:50
[Music]
there's too much to do too much to do and not enough time to do it it is an
0:05
eternal problem that those of us who are authors or entrepreneurs running your own business trying to make your goals
0:11
come true in the world it's just true for all of us there's this huge list of
0:16
things that we need to be doing to move our businesses forward to see our goals come to life to get the results that we
0:22
want and we have less and less time to get it done more demands and even the
0:28
more successful you become the more demands there are on our time so what's the solution how do we get out of this
0:35
cycle of constantly feeling overwhelmed and stressed and getting behind I have
0:40
three simple steps for you today that are going to help you get out of this cycle so let's get started
0:49
foreign [Music] than not this feeling of always being
0:56
behind like you're gonna be too late like you're not getting enough done like there's just too much on your plate to
1:01
handle that you're just not following through or you're disappointing people all the time if that's you and that
1:07
resonates like you could raise your hand right now in the comments if that's you it's most likely coming from the fact
1:12
that you have more on your plate than you have time to get it all done or it
1:18
could be the fact that you are putting so much on your plate because you don't really know what's going to be the most
1:24
effective for you so you're trying everything you're watching what everyone else is doing and you're just trying a little bit of all of it and it could
1:30
also be that you're trying a lot of things and you're just not seeing the results
1:35
you want which then makes you feel a panic around what if I never see these
1:40
results what if I'm going to work this hard my whole life and never see the results that I want to see from all this
1:47
hard work so it could be any of those factors that are leading to this feeling of overwhelm so how do we solve it how
1:54
do we get out of this cycle of always feeling like we're too late we're disappointing people we're too far
1:59
behind we're never going to get it all done well I have three simple steps for you
2:05
today that will start you down the path toward healing this cycle towards feeling better and embracing more joy in
2:11
the process as you get more done and start to see your dreams come true so I'm going to give you these three steps
2:16
today and you can start implementing it right away so the first one is to match
Match Your Time & Tasks
2:22
your time with your tasks and this isn't necessarily difficult but it is
2:28
eye-opening so let me show you what I mean by this for most of us when we start planning out our day we're either
2:36
doing it in our heads and we just have this running to-do list of all the things that need to get done or for some
2:42
of us we're writing it down on a piece of paper or maybe we have it in a planner if you're extra organized or you
2:47
like that kind of thing or maybe it's in a checklist in some kind of Asana or a task list online or something like that
2:53
but a lot of times you have a general idea of all the things you want to get done
2:58
so I want you to think forward since today you might be watching this in the evening or whatever but think forward to
3:04
your next sort of busy work day it could be tomorrow it could be at the start of next week and just jot down for yourself
3:11
a list of all the things that you can think of that you need to get done and this could be your personal stuff or you
3:17
could just keep it to work stuff your goal-oriented type stuff just sit down and make a list of all the things that
3:23
you've been holding in your head or that are on your task list so just as an example it could be you know you're
3:29
going to do a YouTube video uh you're going to post to social media
3:34
maybe you're going to answer some emails maybe you have to mail something out
3:40
maybe you need to you're going to have like a zoom meeting with a partner or
3:47
you know friend or something like that maybe you also really wanting to take a
3:52
few videos of that course you wanted to do you wanted to exercise maybe you gotta make sure you clean the kitchen
3:58
and you got to get that laundry done and this doesn't even include the fact
4:06
that you have to pick the kids up or that you've got to take your dad into his appointment or you know all these
4:11
other things so let's say you make this list of all the things you want to get done when most of us are planning our
4:19
day it's either happening in our head or on a list somewhere and we just think
4:24
about the things that need to get done it's a rare person among us and that
4:31
really stops and thinks about how long each of these things is going to take but what happens for so many of us is we
4:39
have the list and then at the end of the day we feel like we worked all day we've
4:45
exhausted ourselves and maybe only three things on this list are actually checked off and for most of us it's a rare day
4:51
that we actually got through everything we intended to get through and when you stack day after day after day that you
4:59
only get a small portion of your work done it can start to feel overwhelming because you can say to yourself oh my
5:05
gosh I worked as hard as I could I'm hustling I'm working to the point of
5:11
almost wanting to cry some days and I still only got three things done on my list like what's wrong with me and we
5:17
blame ourselves and we actually expend a lot of our personal energy beating
5:23
ourselves up and trying to push ourselves harder and then half the things on this list get migrated into
5:28
tomorrow's list and then maybe we have five days in a row where the kitchen didn't get clean and now we feel like
5:33
we're lazy we're a slob what's wrong with us everyone else can keep their kitchen clean so if any of this sounds
5:39
familiar it might be a little too dramatic for some of you or you might have an even worse situation so we're all kind of on a spectrum with this so
5:46
what I want you to do is make that list of your next kind of busy day and all the things that you would expect yourself to get done
5:52
but then the next thing I want you to do is I want you to estimate how long you
5:58
think it will take you to actually get each of these items done to completion
6:03
to the point where you feel like you can check it off and you know ideally where
6:08
you will feel proud of the work you did not that you were rushing through it or that you were hustling or that you
6:13
didn't get it done the way you wanted but like to get it done the way that you would expect to get it done when you put it on your list now you could do this in
6:21
a number of ways but the way I like to do this is what I call task blocks
6:27
so task block is one thirty minute block
6:32
of time so you might be familiar with this that some people call it the Pomodoro method in the Pomodoro method
6:40
usually it's 25 minutes of work with a five minute break and then every four
6:46
sessions or something like that you take a longer break this is uh pairs with
6:51
that but it's not exactly the same thing so you can set it up any way you want your task block is your period of time
6:57
it could be that you work for 20 minutes and take a 10 minute break every hour or it could be that you work for four task blocks in a row before you take a break
7:03
at all it doesn't really matter the point is that a task block is a 30 minute segment of time
7:09
so that means there's two task blocks to every hour in your day so in in the
7:15
course of a day you have 48 task blocks a day of course most of those you're going to be sleeping or many of those you'll be sleeping so in this list here
7:24
if you take each item individually how long do you think it will take you to do each one and really try to not think
7:30
about how long do I wish it would take me in a perfect world if I had all the tools and all the energy in the world how long
Time Estimates
7:38
will it take me but think on a typical day for myself with the current tools the current energy the current
7:44
motivation that I have how long is it going to take me to do a good job and complete this process and you know how
7:50
long it takes you to clean the kitchen one day might be different than a different day if you have less energy but for now let's just say on an average
7:56
day how long so YouTube video sometimes when we make our lists we make just a
8:02
really big project into one item on the list whereas really these things aren't all equal because
8:09
exercising might take us 20 minutes but finishing a YouTube video might take us six hours right so these aren't always
8:16
equal and we'll talk about that later in the video but when I think about a YouTube video
8:22
I'm going to go through the process of everything I have to do to get this video completed which means maybe outlining it recording it multiple times
8:29
editing it moving the files over to a different computer you know whatever it might be uploading it to YouTube making
8:35
a newsletter list and if I want to actually check this off my list that I got it done it needs to actually be up
8:41
Live on YouTube so for me that's going to take me probably four to five hours so I'm going to say nine task blocks
8:47
which would be four and a half hours for that so try to be actually realistic and a lot of times what you'll notice is
8:54
that because you want to get everything done you try to almost convince your mind that you can do it faster than you
9:01
can but I encourage you to really be realistic here and meet yourself where you are so posting to social media maybe
9:07
that takes one task block maybe it takes you a taskbot to catch up on your email sending out mail though to actually
9:14
package that up and drive back and forth that's going to take two a zoom meeting is going to be an hour so that's two
9:19
times blocks maybe I wanted to spend an hour and a half on this course so that's three task blocks one task blocks of
9:25
exercise one task block to clean the kitchen and maybe two task blocks for laundry because I want to actually get
9:31
them folded and put away actually that might be three depending on the day but let's say you do this and you're like okay so now
9:37
I've got them all estimated but then what I want you to do is I want you to
9:43
count them all up and see how much time you're expecting yourself to work today so that's 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18
9:51
19 20 21 22 so this is 22 task blocks which if you
9:57
divide that into so that you get the hours that's 11 hours worth of work in
10:03
the day and that doesn't include any down time any time to go to the bathroom anytime to eat your meals anytime to
10:09
pick the kids up from school or to go outside and take a walk is this realistic for you most days that you
10:15
could actually get 11 hours worth of work in your number might be different your situation might be different but I
10:22
would bet that a lot of you if you actually followed through with this would find that you are putting more on
10:28
your plate than you can actually get done if I put 11 hours worth of work on my plate every day there's no way it
10:34
would all get done so I would end up maybe getting the video done and some emails and then everything else would be
10:40
undone and then I would think what's wrong with me that I only got two things done
10:45
and then that energy when I show up the next day and it happens again is just stacking negative momentum stacking self
10:53
I don't want to say self-loathing but kind of like self-deprecation
11:00
self-disappointment and then what about the people I didn't get to meet for the meeting and the course I promised people
11:06
and what about the way I feel when I get up and think gosh there's another day I didn't exercise and the worry that comes
11:12
along with what if I don't have a healthy heart because I'm not exercising like there's a million things or seeing
11:18
that your house isn't clean the way that you want it to be and that doesn't give you energy it makes you feel like you're not getting enough done
11:24
and when we stack enough of this constant constant expectation and
11:30
pressure with an unrealistic expectation of what we can get done and how much
11:36
time we have but we aren't actually aware of the disparity between this time that's where we end up feeling
11:42
overwhelmed out of power depressed hard on ourselves and all those things
11:48
and it's one thing to do it for one day but when you zoom out and you see that a whole week you've just been stacking
11:54
days like this where you don't actually have enough time to get it all done because you're putting too much on your plate that's where you can start to see
12:01
why you feel like your life is so difficult because it is because you're you're just setting yourself up for an
12:08
impossible scenario like there will never be more time just because you wish
12:13
it was there you will never create time just because your to-do list was long like the time is the time and you get as
12:20
much done as you can and your expectation plays a lot into how much you can actually get done now when
12:27
I plan my days I I'm a planner person so yours doesn't have to look like this and
12:32
it may not ever you may not want it to look like this this might be something that gives you anxiety but for me what
12:39
has been helping is whether you make a list like this or you put it into a planner is taking a look
12:46
at how much time do I actually have available so if it's Thursday today I
12:52
could go through my schedule and I could say where do I have time today that's not already committed so I have this
12:58
meeting here maybe I know I want to exercise here I've got to pick the kids up here where do I have time that I feel
13:04
like working on my goals that I know I can actually dedicate to it and then I identify that time on my calendar five
13:11
task blocks here three here two here and I add them up and I say okay on a typical day today I have 10 task blocks
13:18
available so instead of just making a list and expecting myself to get it all done with no awareness of how long it's
13:24
going to take I actually decide first how much time do I have today and that's the first thing I do and then I turn
13:31
around and say okay what can I get done in 10 past blocks so then when I look at this list I know this is unrealistic and
13:38
I could say what are my top priorities okay the YouTube video has to get done in that that's going to be 9 out of my
13:43
10. so what else on this list is most important for me to get done maybe it's
13:49
just to clean the kitchen maybe the kitchen's gone too long or maybe as we'll talk about in the next
13:55
part of this video maybe I can get my husband to clean the kitchen and do the laundry today and I can make sure I get
14:00
this exercise in today and these are my 10 task blocks and that's all the time I have for today but then when I finish
14:06
the day and I checked off those two most important things I'm a winner and I feel
14:12
excited and I know I chose the most important things that I made progress instead of looking at this list and
14:17
feeling like I failed or I didn't follow through or I disappointed myself yet again so one of the first things that
14:23
you can do for yourself for your mental health for your joy for your productivity and for your sustainability
14:29
in life and towards your goals is to begin to match up your time your actual available time
14:37
with the tasks that you expect yourself to get done so how many of you
Why You're Overwhelmed
14:42
immediately saw that you're putting more on your plate than you could possibly
14:48
get done in the amount of time you have this is really one of the main things that I see over and over again with
14:55
people is that instead of planning for the time that we have and being realistic about how much time things
15:01
will take we instead just focus on what needs to get done so we'll create a task
15:06
list and we'll say this is what I have to get done today and we pay no mind to
15:11
whether it's actually realistic to expect ourselves to perform all of those
15:17
tasks in a single day so what we often see is that we have let's say six or
15:22
seven hours worth of tasks once we estimate it all out but we only have two hours of free time but because we're not
15:29
actually mentally aware of that disparity we just have a list of expectations and we push ourselves as
15:36
hard as we can for those two hours and then we end up disappointed because half the things didn't get done we have them
15:42
promised we feel like it's our fault and we begin to blame ourselves and wonder why am I not seeing the results I want
15:51
and it's because we're not actually following through with the tasks that we planned to complete or if by some
15:58
miracle you actually did manage to get seven hours worth of tasks done in two hours it's likely that you were pushing
16:05
yourself Beyond a limit of what's healthy you were cutting Corners potentially you were rushing the work it
16:10
wasn't potentially filled with the joy and excitement and magnetism of really
16:16
just loving and putting your passion into your work because you had all this time pressure on your shoulders and then
16:24
over time putting seven hours worth of work into two hours day after day after day is not
16:31
sustainable even if you were skilled enough or you were able to really push yourself hard enough to get it done once
16:37
over time it begins to erode your joy your passion your health and all of
16:44
those things begin to suffer and once our joy our passion our health and our
16:49
belief in ourselves and how we feel about ourselves and the things we say about ourselves begins to deteriorate
16:55
then those two hours that we have to work every day or whatever your situation is becomes harder and harder
17:02
to get more done because we're putting so much pressure and we have so much stress like have you ever woken up one
17:09
day and you just felt so good and you realize that like you put on your headphones and you got the whole house cleaned and this got done and this got
17:15
done and this Aaron got done you were like wow that was just a really exciting focused day and you were feeling good
17:22
the whole time but then on the opposite side of that have you ever had a day where you just didn't feel good and
17:27
you're stressed and you forced yourself to get tasks done on your list and it felt like everything was taking forever
17:32
and none of it turned out any good well when we feel good when we're happy
17:38
when we're excited about what we do when we feel good we get more done and I
17:44
understand that there are some of us that can't always get to a place of feeling good because we have chronic illness or we deal with anxiety or other
17:51
things in our lives but when we pile on top of that extra stress beating
17:57
ourselves up constantly putting more on our plate than as humanly possible because we feel like we have to get it
18:02
done all we're doing is punishing ourselves and putting ourselves deeper into the whole sometimes I like to see
18:09
this as a game okay I have eight task blocks available what can I realistically get done in eight task
18:15
blocks let's make it fun and see how much I can get done rather than ah I can't get it all done there's too much
Make It A Game
18:21
match your tasks with your available time and you'll start to see that it was
18:26
never you all along there was never anything wrong with you you were just literally putting more on your plate
18:32
than you could humanly do and let me tell you many of us especially if you're an overachiever or Enneagram three like
18:38
me or you put a lot of pressure on yourself to achieve your goals you're going to find that sometimes when you
18:45
start to get realistic you have a morning period of I can't only get this done
18:51
but here's what I want you to understand and this is like a heavy truth bomb to drop here for those of you that are like
18:56
this that are like me is that you weren't getting it done anyway
19:01
you feel like you have to get it done so you put it on your plate and you push yourself and you push yourself and you push yourself but it wasn't getting done
19:08
effectively anyway so continuing to put it on your plate and feel like you have to is really just punishing yourself the
19:15
other thing is more time will not magically appear just because you feel like you need it to
19:22
it never has worked in the past and it will never work in the future you cannot continue to put seven hours worth of
19:28
work into two hours of time or a full Year's worth of work into the next three
19:33
months you can't do it it's not going to work out and it will not be sustainable and you will not be putting out your
19:40
best work and you will not be joyful through the process so I encourage you no matter how hard it is no matter how
19:46
much you feel like you have to get these things done to get realistic about your time and match up your available time
19:52
with the tasks that you're trying to get done that's step number one so now that you have this idea of matching time with
Prioritize
19:58
tasks what do we do with all those tests that aren't going to get done this is also something that can be emotionally
20:05
difficult for those of us that have chronically been putting more on our plate than we can actually get done and
20:12
who feel like it has to get done so what else do I do well this is where you
20:17
really need to sit down and write down all the things all the projects that you have currently on your your plate the
20:22
books you're planning to write the Etsy shop that you're starting the Discord server the social media all the things
20:30
that are currently in progress and you need to start looking at each one individually like the big kind of
20:36
buckets of things that you're doing your social media your promotions your Facebook ads whatever it may be for you
20:42
and start to prioritize and say what out of all this list can I delegate to
20:47
someone else what out of all this list can get pushed back to another time so I can get control of my schedule and what
20:54
are the things that really need to get done and then hopefully you've pruned your
20:59
list just a little bit because a lot of us will end up having things on our list that we feel like must get done just
21:05
because we saw someone else getting success with this and there's this feeling of fear of missing out like if
21:10
I'm not on Tick Tock what will happen because all these authors are finding success on Tick Tock and if I'm not
21:16
there what if I miss out on my big break and these are valid fears like there are
21:22
people getting big on different platforms but the truth is you can look for any example people that are finding
21:30
success with subscriptions direct sales people that are good in KU people that are publishing their books themselves
21:36
people who are publishing through Publishers there are just infinite examples of success out there and once
21:43
you start to understand that you get to create the level of success that you want that you don't have to be
21:49
everything to everyone you don't have to be everywhere all the time and you're actually more likely to find success by
21:56
focusing in on a single platform or a single strategy than you are by
22:02
spreading yourself so thin that you never actually completed anything once you start to understand that that's when
22:08
you'll start to take control of your career because like I explained in the first part of this video when you have
22:13
more on your plate then you can actually get done you may have this great strategy of I'm going to be really
22:19
active on five different social media platforms but if you don't actually
22:24
consistently post to all of them that strategy means nothing it's the follow through that helps you get to the
22:30
results so if right now with your available time you are only capable of following through with one platform then
22:37
you will get better results from that one platform than you would from being on all five now if you could be active
22:45
on all five and be super consistent sure maybe you would get better results from that but we cannot become something
22:52
we're not we cannot invent extra time we cannot push ourselves be Beyond a level
22:57
of good health and skill and capability we cannot push ourselves beyond the level of the habits and the systems that
23:04
we've already set up so if you can get yourself to this mindset of yes I had
23:09
all these plans I had all these things I wanted to do but this right here is what I'm capable of being consistent on this
23:16
is what I can say is my top priority and this is what is sustainable for me and you can practice radical self-acceptance
23:23
with that and say this is where I am and I'm going to be successful with this one
23:29
strategy instead of allowing all of the noise of everything everyone else is doing make you feel like you
23:36
have to be all those things and then failing at all of them or failing at most of them or not
23:42
following through on most of them if you can stop that and you can say this is where I'm gonna focus and I
23:48
believe in myself and make that Focus something that's sustainable for you you will literally
23:54
change your own life overnight so write down all the things that you currently
24:00
have on your plate and then start prioritizing and start matching those projects up with the time that you have
24:06
available and making sure that you're only putting on your plate what you can currently handle as you are not as some
24:13
super version of yourself not as some like I will be this person tomorrow I
24:19
know I can do it version as who you are right now in this moment with your limitations with your health with your
24:25
current time available these are the things I can do and you can always grow from there but it is very difficult to
24:31
grow from a place of I have all this pressure on my back and I'm never living
24:37
up to it instead go to a place of this is sustainable and doable for me and
24:43
then I can use that as a springboard it makes all the difference I promise third step is my favorite step which is
Micro Tasks
24:51
to take the projects that you have decided you have time and energy for and break those into tiny achievable micro
24:59
tasks if you know me at all you know that I like to put those micro tasks onto Post-it notes which I put on a
25:05
kanban board on the wall if you'd like to see that I have tons of videos here on YouTube talking about my kanban board
25:11
and how I break things down in two steps so I would encourage you to watch this video next where you're going to get a
25:17
chance to look at those kanban boards and how I use it but Post-it notes is how I do it because for me if it's out
25:24
of sight it's out of mind so for you it might be a checklist it could be something in notion it could be Trello
25:29
it could be just having a daily planner for me I like to have it in my planner
25:36
and I like to have it up on the wall and every single micro task gets a Post-It note so that when I finish it I get to
25:43
move it down the board and that makes me feel successful that I say this was a task I was meant to do today and now I
25:50
get to move it to the done section of my kanban board every kanban board that I use has a to-do section A doing section
25:57
currently in process and then a done section and getting the opportunity to just move that Post-It note that says
26:04
record the video and move it to the done section is like yes I got that done and
26:09
I feel accomplished and what happens is when we take those big projects like get
26:16
the video done or even something bigger like start a YouTube channel and we look
26:22
at how huge that feels it can often feel like we don't know where to start like
26:28
we're clueless like we don't have any control like it feels like it's such a big project I don't even know if I can
26:33
be successful it doesn't feel feel possible for us but if we take that project of starting a YouTube channel
26:38
finishing a book creating a bestseller or whatever it may be replacing my
26:44
income getting to quit my job we have these big goals but when we break those down into projects and we say Okay first
26:50
I'm going to start with finishing this book and that is going to be achievable for me and it know I know that finishing
26:56
this book leads to publishing this book leads to making money on this book but right now I'm just going to focus on
27:01
finishing this book but even finishing this book is so huge so in order to give
27:07
ourselves pleasure excitement passion and to feel like it's achievable
27:13
break that project of finishing the book into micro tasks I am going to write 500
27:19
Words put that on your board put that on your checklist and then when you get
27:25
here today and you get ready to work you sit down at your desk you say okay I've got 500 words to write it's going to
27:31
take me about 30 minutes to do it or it could be an hour or it could be 10 minutes everyone's different but you may
Pep Talk
27:36
know okay I've got 30 minutes to write I'm gonna try for this 500 words and
27:42
then you actually sit down and you get it done oh that feels so good and finishing it
27:48
moving it down checking it off is such a rush of I actually completed this so the
27:55
third piece of this puzzle once you have matched your time to your tasks you have
28:01
decided on what your priorities are and what you're going to focus on that you can honestly get done in the
28:06
time and energy you have available and then you start breaking those projects down into tiny little micro tasks that
28:13
you can complete in 30 minutes or an hour or one single session a day you
28:18
will start to own your schedule you will start to build positive momentum you will start to say nice things about
28:25
yourself because you're not setting yourself up for disappointment anymore so many of us have been setting
28:31
ourselves up every single day for disappointment we're putting a mountain
28:37
eight hours worth of work that we're trying to squeeze into an hour and then we're blaming ourselves when it doesn't
28:42
get done and we aren't even aware of it because we don't understand what we're doing to ourselves so this is your
28:48
wake-up call wake up to how much you're putting on your plate how much of it isn't even moving the needle or making
28:55
any difference in your career and is just adding stress and Punishment to your life and instead say I deserve to
29:03
be happy while I'm being productive I deserve to enjoy the process of building
29:09
my dream life step by step and so I'm going to take a look at how much time I
29:14
really have available I'm going to make sure I'm not putting more on my plate than what I can do in that amount of time and then I'm going
29:21
to break down the projects that I know I need to complete into tiny little steps that I can get done one at a time in a
29:29
single session and I am going to build positive momentum in my life I am going
29:34
to see results because I'm actually finishing projects and I'm going to be
29:39
happier and more joyful while I'm doing it I can't promise that this will eliminate
29:45
your stress for the rest of your life I can't promise that you won't have moments where you feel overwhelmed because this is part of the human
29:51
experience but if you can Embrace this process of not putting more on your plate than you can reasonably handle
29:59
and just allowing that to be enough and truly accepting yourself and creating a plan that meets you where you are and
30:05
that breaks it down into something that you feel and you know and you believe on a daily basis that you can actually
30:11
achieve and you start building and stacking wins instead of building and
30:16
stacking disappointment it will change your life so those are my three steps let me know
30:23
how it works out for you if you are interested in going into this process in even more depth where I will walk you
30:29
through every single step of how to decide what your priorities are how to take that realistic look at your time
30:34

30:40
goals down into small achievable tasks I walk you through this in my new detail
30:46

30:51

31:27
understanding how to create a life that gives you the actual ability to be

holy guacamole you guys today is nine years since I published my very first
0:07
book beautiful demons and I am going to just take this moment today to really
0:13
celebrate that and to talk to you guys about some of the lessons that I've learned and kind of give you a little
0:18
bit of a pep talk if you're a writer who is thinking about self-publishing and you're doubting it all whether you can
0:24
make a success out of this because I really want to let you know that making that decision to self-publish
0:30
nine years ago was one of the greatest things I ever did in my life so I hope you'll stick around and listen to some
0:37
of my I don't know if I want to call it wisdom I'll call it hard-earned wisdom because I've made a lot of mistakes
0:43
along the way and taking wrong paths so that hopefully I can share that with you and you can follow a better path but how
0:50
exciting nine years next year I'm totally going to do some kind of big blowout because one decade since
0:57
self-publishing so I'm excited for that but let's talk about nine years indie
1:04
publishing and what that has meant to me
1:10
so when I was thinking about what I wanted to talk about in this video I was
1:15
really just really thinking about you guys because I could have made this
1:20
video about here's how many books I've sold and here's how much money I've made which that might be really interesting
1:26
to a lot of people as well so if you're interested in seeing some of those more like number videos let me know but this
1:31
is an emotional day for me it's an exciting day for me and I know that there are a lot of writers out there
1:36
that are hoping to someday have you know the experience of being able to say I self-published nine years ago and I'm
1:43
supporting my family with my income so I want to give you some tips and some
1:50
encouragement about how I did that and what has really meant the most to me so
1:57
whether you've been watching me for a while or you're brand new to heart briefings let me tell you a little bit
2:02
about myself so you understand where I'm coming from I have big goals I want to
2:08
be that author who you know has the lines around the block and hits the lists and has a movie deal out of her
2:16
stuff and has fans dressing up and cosplay and all that stuff like I want to be that author and I want to be super
2:23
successful however I also know that there are certain things that I'm not
2:29
willing to do to find that level of success because in my opinion when you
2:34
start to game the system or you're just not being true or writing the things that you really are passionate about
2:40
writing either that level of success is never going to come to you or it's going to be fake and Hollow when it does come
2:47
to you because you didn't really earn it you're not really connected to your stories and I never want to be somebody
2:53
who sounds super judgmental but at the same time I feel like there are a lot of people in the indie space who will talk
3:01
about how fast you need to write about how you don't need to be writing what you love you should be writing to this
3:07
trend and they basically tell you to kill your joy in writing and pump out a
3:14
bunch of widgets as fast as you can I even hear people these days saying things like quality doesn't matter just
3:19
get it out as fast as you can there are even people teaching courses out there on the sales page it says stuff like
3:25
it's not worth the time to write your own books and you should buy them from other people and the state of that part
3:32
of the industry which doesn't even feel like it's part of my industry because it's so far off from what I value as a
3:39
writer I mean that part of the industry to me is toxic and it's harmful to younger authors or to newer authors who
3:46
are wanting to get their start because it can be so confusing when you want success really badly and it's not coming
3:53
to you as quickly as you wanted it can be really tempting to listen to people that will say here's how you cut a bunch
3:58
of corners and get there faster but really what I want to share with you today is why it's so important to listen
4:05
to your own heart and trust your own instincts it may not get you to you know making six figures as fast as if you had
4:12
potentially bought books from a ghostwriter but if you are watching this today because you have stories inside of
4:19
you that you desperately want to tell then you would be doing yourself a disservice to let someone else write
4:26
those books because it's the experience of writing if you want to be a writer and a well-known author write your own
4:32
books and it just is one of those things that you can't talk about without sounding judgmental so I just want you
4:39
to know that my heart is in the right place because what I really want to do is protect authors like you from falling
4:46
into those traps where you feel like I have no choice but to write this genre that I don't love or I have no choice
4:52
but to focus mostly on marketing and not worry about my books or I have no choice but to go faster than I want to go and
4:59
all of this stuff is part of the challenge of indie publishing when I
5:04
started way back in the old days of 2010 it was a lot different it wasn't easier
5:10
because there were no resources nobody none of us really knew what we were doing we were kind of all out there on
5:16
our own there were no bookbub ads there were no Facebook ads you know that stuff didn't exist back then so we had to
5:22
figure out how to find readers on our own without those types of platforms and it was you know it was difficult it
5:30
wasn't easy at all but at the same time there weren't as many people in our ears telling us how to
5:35
you got to do this you got to do this there also weren't as many people out on Facebook and social media and YouTube
5:41
telling us how much money they're making so that comparison wasn't really there it was more like a wild frontier you
5:48
know of wow this is kind of interesting and I don't know if I can make money doing this but I want to try so it was
5:53
very different and I will acknowledge that but at the same time it wasn't easy because there was no road map and the
6:00
problem now is that there are plenty of people willing to give you a road map but what you have to understand is that
6:07
there is no one-size-fits-all there is no one answer you know there is no like
6:12
specific this is the way that you self-publish and this is how you get to a million dollars and some people will
6:18
try to sell that to you they'll say this is how you have to do it you have no choice if you want to be successful you have to go into Kindle unlimited you
6:24
have to write 12 books a year you have to write this specific genre because like I hear people all the time say I
6:31
don't write y ay because Y it doesn't sell or no one can sell books in Y a and Here I am sitting right here as a young
6:38
adult author for the past nine years who has made six figures a year for many many years and it's just one of those
6:45
lies that people tell either because they don't have experience enough or because they tried and failed or because
6:51
they just heard it from someone else someone else told them why it doesn't sell so then they didn't write it and then they tell somebody else but it's
6:58
not always true so first thing I want to tell you guys is there really is no one
7:04
set right way to self publish you don't have to be all over social media I have
7:10
friends who are successful as authors who are almost completely non-existent
7:15
on social media they have a website that has the list of their books maybe they have a Facebook page that they post
7:21
cover art and you know the occasional release date announcement type thing but
7:26
they're not connected to their fans on any type of social media and yet they make six to seven figures a year I have
7:32
one specific friend who makes seven figures a year and he's almost does no social media at all so when people say
7:38
well the only way to self publish and be successful is you got to have Twitter and Instagram and you got to have this many followers on Facebook and you have
7:45
to have a group and you've got to be on Wattpad and you know whatever it's like that's just a lie that's just something
7:50
maybe they've been told those things can enhance your career if you show up well they're so if you really enjoy Instagram
7:58
and you're great at taking photos then go to Instagram and make that your platform and it can absolutely enhance
8:03
your career but it is not a prerequisite for you especially if you aren't very good at taking photos you're probably
8:09
not gonna build a huge following on Instagram so think about where you show up best what you want your career to
8:16
look like and then make your career feel and look exactly like you want it to because I'm telling you right now from
8:23
experience of not only what I've experienced in my life but from what I've watched other people go through and
8:29
do and you know there's people when when someone says oh you can't do this I sit and watch people do it you can't make
8:36
money writing y-a and then me and several of my friends all make money writing yaa and it's not like we're
8:41
traditionally published or have some other big marketing budget you know I spend less than $200 a month on
8:46
marketing and I still sell books so there are a lot of things that go around that just simply aren't true and I'm not
8:52
sure where they or originated or why people continue to spread them but you do hear a lot of people say you have to
8:58
be active and big on all social media platforms but you really don't you could just choose one that you particularly
9:04
love to engage in or you could choose none of them or you could just have a really big blog or you could try and
9:11
show up on all of them if you really enjoy it it's really up to you because there's no one way I hear a lot of
9:17
people these days saying that you have to spend thousands of dollars on ads every month just to make it in indie
9:23
publishing and that's not true either because I have lots of friends again myself included who don't spend more
9:29
than a couple hundred dollars a month on advertising and of course when I first started I spent zero dollars on
9:34
advertising and I only spent fifty bucks on my cover and I at the beginning didn't use a professional editor I had
9:41
friends and critique partners who were editing my book now I did since go back and hire editors to re-edit those books
9:48
because you need to put your best foot forward but sometimes you know people will say you have to spend all this
9:53
money to get your book off the ground and it's not necessarily true so that's
9:58
really one of the first things I want to tell you because I've learned it but I also have seen it through experience is
10:04
that there really isn't a one-size-fits-all path to success it's up to you to decide what you want
10:12
success to look like I talked about this in both of my courses in my planner all over this YouTube channel because it is
10:18
so much the fundamental thing of enjoying this career and having you know building the life that you want creating
10:25
the life and career that you want you have to know as an individual what you want what is your ideal life look like
10:32
and then have faith in the fact that you can create that life that you can make
10:37
your life look like that what happens when we start to let fear come in when
10:43
we start to doubt ourselves or we start to think oh my gosh I can't do this it's too scary you know whatever when we let
10:49
fear guide us and be the number one thing that's you know leading our choices or determining our choices we
10:56
start looking outside of ourselves we start looking at what everybody else is doing and then we start making choices
11:01
that might not really like be true to who we are because we're scared this is
11:08
something I have done and I've talked about this before in other videos I talked about this in my self-publishing course because I'm not afraid to talk
11:14
about the things that I've done wrong because it might help you decide differently for yourself but I had a
11:21
book called the trouble with goodbye and this was very different from the things I had been writing before it's a
11:27
contemporary romance new adult and this was a super important book to me because it was a mirror of something that had
11:34
happened in my own life and it was very emotional it was not a sexy romance it was only from the female point of view
11:40
it was a more emotional type book almost more like women's fiction but it was a
11:46
romance that book I had a lot of friends telling me this is going to hit you know
11:52
the USA Today this is really good timing it's really trendy you know and I got excited because I thought wow did I
11:58
write something like on the cusp of a trend that might take off really big so I put the book out and it did very well
12:05
but it was still disappointing because I didn't hit the USA Today I actually came very very close because I had a friend
12:11
who sold like I think about 300 book more than I did that week and she hit
12:16
the list and I did not so I was super super close probably the closest I've ever come in my career to hitting the
12:22
USA Today bestseller list and I was disappointed and I had a lot of people in a Facebook group that I belong to too
12:28
that were telling me you've got to write this sexier if you if that first book had been sexy instead of so emotional
12:34
you would have hit the list like you got a you know really put that the heat into it and make it bad boys and you know
12:41
really follow this trend and so I took the second book and I added things into
12:47
it they were not true to my writing style or to the tone of that first book and I you know sort of compromised who I
12:55
was as a writer trying to get more sales and it's the first and only time that
13:01
I've ever ever done that and when that book came out it did extremely well just like the first one but what happened was
13:09
I had a lot of people who didn't like it because when they bought book 2 they were looking for something similar in
13:15
experience and tone to what they loved about book 1 and I didn't give them that at the beginning of that book I gave
13:21
them a book that wasn't truly a Sarah Canon style book and a lot of people were disappointed and they gave up on
13:27
the series so even though they bought book two hoping for that next like good experience they didn't buy book three or
13:33
four or five or six and so I had a series that went really really well if books wanted to and then nosedived from
13:40
three through six and I could never recover that and I have not gone back to
13:45
rewrite that book because it serves as a lesson to me of what happens when I don't follow my own instincts if I have
13:52
just trusted my own instincts stayed true to myself instead of listening to all these people who were saying you've
13:57
got to follow the trends you've got to do you know these other things that are going to make it more successful and my own fear if I had not listened to my own
14:05
fear that was saying what if it isn't what if people don't like it what if I'm not good enough what if I'm not writing the right things what if I never hit the
14:11
USA Today bestseller list what if you know all these fears that we're talking to me if I hadn't listened to that I
14:17
would have written a book that was similar to my voice in the first one and that would have been true to myself and
14:23
who knows what might have happened with that series it would have continued to grow I'm sure because the next
14:28
sar all true to that voice but just people in a series they don't get past book two and I see it over and over and
14:34
over again even now when I look at my numbers there's a lot of people that just give up midway through book two another thing
14:40
that I want to encourage you as you get into this career and you think about publishing you think about your writing
14:46
is don't let fear or the voices of people around you talk you out of doing
14:52
the things that are most important to you or talk you into compromising who
14:57
you are are the books you want to write right now there's a market for just about every kind of book and yes there
15:04
is a way to market yourself there are ways to put yourself out there you can't
15:10
necessarily just write like ten different genres and put you know
15:16
homemade cover on all of them and just slap them all out there you know five years apart and hope to have this
15:22
amazing career you might still land somewhere lucky with a you know a lottery ticket type one win with one of
15:29
those books but there are strategies that you can follow to make yourself more likely to have success so I'm not
15:36
saying that there aren't strategies because there absolutely are some proven strategies but what I'm saying is if you
15:42
compromise who you are along the way you're probably going to regret it at
15:48
some point I even have some friends who did that who compromised what they really wanted to write and then they did
15:55
find success but you know what they're not happy I have one friend in particular of course I'm not gonna say her name she's not happy with what she's
16:01
writing but she's having great success with it but she's miserable inside she hates writing it she kind of wants to
16:07
quit but she's terrified that if she goes in and writes the kind of thing she really wants to write that it's not
16:13
gonna sell because she found success in this one niche that she just never really wanted to write but other people
16:20
convinced her to write it so it's like how much does that success and that money really mean long-term it's
16:26
exciting for a little while it's I mean it's awesome you've got you know a nicer house or you've got all these things but
16:32
like how long does that sustain you just by having success if it's not what you
16:37
really want to write and it doesn't feed your soul so you know you have to weigh those types of
16:44
consequences like as much as you want success do you want it so badly that you're willing to be miserable to get it
16:50
or that you're willing to compromise who you are or what you want to write in order to get it and for some people the
16:57
answer is yes for a certain amount of time and then ten years down the road they regret it and I've seen it happen
17:03
over and over again so just what I'm getting at is don't let fear be your guide decide what you want your life and
17:11
your career to look like how much social media do you want to be on how you know what types of books do you want to write
17:17
what are you willing to do in terms of marketing how much money and time do you want to spend managing that data really
17:22
sit down and think about what you want that career to look like in tune out those voices that say you can't right
17:29
way you can't make me any money oh this genre is dead this genre is to overflowing with people it's too crowded
17:35
oh you've got to spend money on this this is the trend just like turn off those voices put in some ear ear plugs
17:41
turn off all those voices and sit down and really think about what is it that you want in an ideal world if somebody
17:47
said you can write whatever you want and be successful what would you be writing how would your career look to you what kinds of things
17:54
would you be doing how many books a year would you be writing so really think about that and then when you come out of
18:00
that like dream world that you were in that you were thinking about all of these things start figuring out how you
18:07
can make that dream of yours a reality because I promise you that if you put
18:12
enough time and thought into it and you learn the strategies you can pretty much take any dream in each genre any type of
18:18
life that you want and you can make it a reality in this business you just have to know what it is you want and you have
18:24
to have the courage to go after it and the minute you start to let fear be your
18:29
guide or the voices of other people who are telling you you're doing it wrong be your guide that's when you start to go
18:36
down the wrong path I have never let fear help me make a decision and not
18:42
regret it every single time I let fear take control I regret the choices that I
18:48
made just like with that book and in the end choosing the more trendy type of style did not help me because it wasn't
18:55
true who I was as a writer and the readers you know understood that they read it and it didn't resonate with them it
19:01
didn't feel right and so I know for me I have to write the things that I love to
19:06
write in order to be successful another thing that I would love to say to you is enjoy the journey I know that we all get
19:14
really impatient to get to this next level of like oh if I could only be
19:20
making enough money to quit my job I would be happy but then I'll tell you what's gonna happen you're gonna make
19:26
enough money someday to quit your job and then you're gonna be home all day by yourself writing and you're gonna notice
19:31
that you know you're still writing in the living room with your like cheap Walmart furniture or whatever it is and
19:37
you're gonna think gosh you know I'm miserable here in this tiny apartment if I could just make enough money to buy a
19:42
house in the suburbs or whatever then I would be really happy or that swanky apartment downtown then I would be happy
19:48
so then you're gonna work really hard and maybe even do things that you don't want just to make that money faster so
19:55
you can have that house and you're gonna move on to that next house and there's gonna be something wrong with that - you're gonna think you know if I could
20:01
just have that nice or car or if I could just get a better laptop or you know what if I could just hit the USA today I
20:07
would be happier if I could just see my book in a bookstore and there's always gonna be that next thing and if you do
20:13
that you're constantly like kicking the can down the road waiting for that next goal to make you happy then you're gonna
20:19
wake up one day 90 years old thinking gosh I never found happiness and I
20:26
wasted so much time trying to get to that next thing now I am definitely
20:31
someone who is a huge proponent of you know creating big goals for ourselves I
20:37
always have a big goal like one of my biggest goals is to someday be able to afford a house on the marsh with a pool
20:43
and a deep water dock you know I want that life but I am enjoying my life
20:48
right here right now at the same time and I think that that's really the trick to happiness no matter what career
20:53
you're in is like knowing what you want having a very clear vision of what you're trying to create in your life but
20:59
also enjoying where you are right now I loved the writing process at the very
21:07
beginning absolutely loved it and I was so happy to be a writer my
21:12
husband George and I lived in this tiny little town house that was you know carpet that had been there for you know
21:19
20 years air conditioner that would give out and break kitchen that had you know
21:25
the worst laminate countertops or whatever like stains on the floor it was just not the most beautiful house but I
21:32
was so excited to be writing and I loved that experience and I was so happy to be
21:39
in a career that I loved and writing these great books but what started to happen was I started to get impatient
21:46
for the next step like I wanted to be someone that people looked up to is like wow she's just really selling a lot of
21:52
books and my motivations were really in the wrong place like I wanted to impress other people I wanted to you know hit
21:59
this next goal faster and I started to focus more on like the business side of things and how can I be better and if I
22:05
could just afford this bigger house or if I could just support for my husband to quit his job and you know I had all
22:10
of these out our goals and suddenly I stopped enjoying the writing process and
22:15
I do have a story about this that I want to tell you guys when I have more time that's my Dragonfly story which I will
22:22
share with you soon but basically I got myself so like focused on the future and
22:29
what I was trying to build that I was willing to compromise myself like with that story the moment we began and I got
22:37
so frantic I started all these different series like reaching for that next big thing instead of really focusing in on
22:42
the strategy that I wanted to do so it's kind of like that fear and that you know impatience for hitting the next goals
22:49
really stole the joy of the journey from me and I woke up several years later
22:56
actually and realized I don't even like what I'm doing anymore because it's not about the joy of the writing as much
23:02
like when I would get really into the books I would love it love it love it but I was stressed out all the time
23:08
about all the things I had to do and whether I was reaching these goals or not and I couldn't even enjoy like oh
23:14
sell 10,000 books in a month and I wasn't even happy with that I was like it's not enough you know and I was so
23:19
hard on myself I had totally forgotten to enjoy the journey and you know what my husband did
23:24
quit his job and he still doesn't work I'm solely in charge of the finances for this family which is a huge
23:31
accomplishment but back then instead of enjoying that and celebrating that and being happy with where I had you know
23:37
what had accomplished I was stressed about what's the next thing and am I gonna be able to keep this up and what do I need to do in his strategy strategy
23:44
strategy and I got the big house and I got you know the dream life so to speak
23:49
and I wasn't happy at all and when I had to take a step back and say why is this stuff that I worked so hard for not
23:55
making me happy I started to realize that it's because I was constantly stressed out about what am I going to do
24:02
to get to the next level and instead of just sitting back and thinking I love to
24:07
write I love hanging out with my fans I appreciate them so much let's just enjoy
24:13
this journey let's enjoy life as it is now while still working for those big goals but let's have fun here that's
24:19
that's when everything changed for me my husband and I moved with our son Andrew here to Charleston to live near the
24:25
beach and we just decided let's make our lives look and feel the way we want them to and I dropped a lot of things that
24:32
were not making me happy I dropped a lot of Facebook groups that were trying to
24:37
tell me about oh you've got to do it this way everybody should join Kindle and limited you should be writing faster you've got to stop writing why eh I
24:43
stopped listening to all those people and you know what happened my income didn't go down and I was happy and that
24:51
is something that I really want for you guys as well is to just stop and enjoy the journey you may not be where you
24:59
want to be yet maybe you want a big trad pub deal maybe you want a movie deal someday maybe you want a bigger house
25:04
maybe you want to quit your job and those are all great things to start looking forward to but when you're
25:10
looking forward to those things and you're reaching for those goals don't forget to enjoy today don't forget to
25:17
enjoy the fact that you get to sit down and create worlds out of your brain that other people are going to read don't
25:23
forget that you love this process that there are books you love to read that there are reasons why you wanted to
25:28
write don't forget that you have this incredible opportunity
25:34
to change your life and to transform your life to quit your job to do all these things and that stuff will come to
25:40
you with time if you follow your heart and you really start to learn about the business learn more about the craft but
25:46
enjoy the journey as you're going through it because otherwise you're gonna wake up ten years from now and you're gonna have all those things you
25:51
wanted and you're gonna realize that you are miserable and it's just not worth it I want to get to that house on the marsh
25:58
someday and be deliriously happy the whole way through and of course there
26:03
are challenges I'm suffering right now from a lot of postpartum anxiety and you know talked about that some in my
26:09
facebook or my stories and stuff but you know it doesn't mean that every moment is happy or that we don't struggle but
26:17
it just means try to enjoy that journey try to be true to yourself as you're moving through or moving towards those
26:24
goals don't let fear be your master don't let fear be your guide instead let your own intuition your own joy and that
26:32
ideal life that you set for yourself let that be your guide and just have confidence in yourself that you're going
26:38
to be able to create that life that you want so badly because I truly believe after nine years of self-publishing
26:45
I have made more than a million dollars doing this I have sold almost 3/4 of a
26:51
million books and what I have learned is that the biggest moments of success for
26:57
me have not come from trying to gain the system or trying to cut corners or trying to take out you know thousands of
27:03
dollars of Facebook Ads I know that stuff works for other people but I've been true to myself and my own intuition
27:08
and the biggest successes for me have come when I've been super excited about a story and I've just focused on the
27:15
writing and I focused on you know building up my community of fans those two things have made the biggest impact
27:22
for me and those two things are the most important to me community and the joy of
27:28
writing what I want those two things are absolutely the most important to me and when I focus on those two things I find
27:35
the biggest success financially spiritually emotionally it always comes
27:43
down to that so this is really more of hopefully what you will find a pep talk saying that if you want your
27:51
career to be something don't listen to the people that say oh well you can't do that you can't write weii and make money
27:56
you can't do this and make money oh well you have to take out all these ads or you have to be all over social media
28:01
even though you don't enjoy it just stop listening to some of those people and
28:06
start listening to yourself what is it that you really want believe that you can achieve it and then start learning
28:13
the strategies of how I'm going to do this okay if you don't want to be on social media or you only want to be on
28:18
YouTube then what's your best strategy start listening to the people that are successful on YouTube or start watching
28:25
the people that are successful that have no social media and start figuring out
28:30
what it is they do if you want to write why and everybody tells you that you can't make money writing why a start
28:36
looking to the authors who are doing it and are finding success in young adult and if you can't find someone that is
28:43
doing or has the life that you want then just trust for yourself start writing it
28:48
out and use yourself as your own inspiration because if it's something that you want then you can absolutely
28:54
have it you might not make it overnight you men time make it as fast as some of these people who are using ghost writers
29:00
but I guarantee you that your success and your joy will last a heck of a lot longer than theirs will because you're
29:06
doing it in a way that's aligned with who you are and that's true to who you are and you know you're not going to
29:12
burn out you're not going to get tired of it you're gonna just have this joy as you go through that journey and you know
29:18
nine years of self-publishing that's really some of the biggest most
29:23
important things that I've learned I hope that this means something to you I hope that there are some of you out
29:29
there that are listening to this now and feeling encouraged that you can make your career look and feel the way that
29:35
you want it to and also just stop feeling so rushed you're not going to
29:40
miss out on your dreams you're not going to be so far behind that you never can
29:46
self publish or find a publisher or that you'll never find the success that you want just trust the timing of your
29:53
own life and your own dreams get to work start doing the things you need to do but you don't have to cut corners and
29:59
you don't have to sacrifice who you are or who you want to be you just have to enjoy the journey and
30:05
follow your passions and take action that's true to who you are and you're gonna be okay you're gonna be a success
30:11
I first started self-publishing in 2010 and I had been writing for a few years
30:18
before that but when I took that leap and I decided to self-publish it was not
30:24
about fear it was not about you know listening to what other people said because trust me so many people in my
30:31
life at that time said you're killing your whole career if you self-published nobody self publishes unless they just
30:36
are terrible writers bla bla bla bla bla if I had listened to all those people or
30:42
had listened to fear I would not be sitting here where I am in my beautiful house in Charleston with my husband who
30:48
stays home with me all day and my beautiful baby girl upstairs and my son at a you know wonderful private school
30:53
we wouldn't have this life that we love and I wouldn't be making six figures a year writing the books that I love or
30:59
have thousands of fans none of that would exist because I would have listened to people who were trying to make me scared and I would have
31:05
listened to my own fear and doubt instead that was like one moment in my life that I decided to follow the
31:12
excitement and the joy I followed the excitement of I'm gonna write this book
31:17
that I think sounds really cool and I'm gonna get it out there and it's gonna be really fun and I wrote it and I loved it
31:24
and I had fun doing it and I put it out there and the rest is history you know that was beautiful demons nine years ago
31:30
and now I've sold over half a million copies of the books in that series and
31:36
that world and I'll be working soon on book 11 of that series I've been writing
31:41
it for nearly a decade and you know that is what it's about following your joy
31:46
and following your passion instead of following your fear and I hope that somehow this is resonated with you I
31:52
know it's been a little bit rambling but I just decided that for nine year celebration I was just gonna talk from
31:58
my heart about what I think is most important and hopefully encourage you that you can make this career however
32:05
you want just follow your intuition follow your joy follow your excitement and be ok alright guys that's all I have for
32:12
you if you are new to this channel go ahead and subscribe I would love to have you here in our little community for
32:18
heart breathing so like this video and I'd love to have you comment down below and I will see you guys in my next video
32:24
bye [Music]
need to know before you're ready to
0:09
self-publish now I'm sure you're
0:16
wondering what is that one thing that
0:18
you need before you self-publish it
0:20
could be cover art or you need to figure
0:22
out an editor or you need to figure out
0:24
you know what genre you're gonna write
0:26
all those things of course you're gonna
0:28
have to figure it out eventually but
0:30
there is one thing that you need to
0:32
figure out first because every decision
0:35
you make from the beginning of making
0:39
that commitment to self-publish or to
0:41
get your books out in the world there is
0:43
one decision that can help you make all
0:45
the other decisions honestly when I
0:49
first became a writer and I said I want
0:52
to self publish this is back in 2010 I
0:55
said you know what it's gonna be amazing
0:59
I'm just gonna be a writer I'm gonna
1:01
write as many books as I can I'm just
1:03
gonna be immersed in that world and I
1:05
had been writing for several years and I
1:07
thought nothing would really change I
1:09
would just be putting my books out there
1:11
without having to deal with the
1:12
publisher but it's not really like that
1:14
in truth you're becoming an entrepreneur
1:19
you're committing to being a creative
1:22
entrepreneur which means that you not
1:23
only need to find time for writing but
1:26
you also have to figure out how to run
1:28
your own business this is not easy I
1:31
never dreamed when I said oh I want to
1:34
self publish my novels that I would be
1:36
committing to being someone who runs her
1:39
own business I'm basically a CEO and
1:42
everybody who self publishes their work
1:44
is the CEO of their own business and
1:47
before you even start you need to think
1:50
about that and what do CEOs do all day
1:53
long all the time they make decisions
1:55
and I sometimes like to say that being
1:58
an indie author is like being a
2:00
professional decision maker you have to
2:03
make decisions every step of the way in
2:05
your book what are your characters say
2:07
where are they gonna go next how does
2:08
this conflict arise what is this villain
2:11
going to do it never
2:13
in terms of how many decisions you have
2:15
to make and if that wasn't bad enough
2:17
once you get into the actual publishing
2:20
side of things you also have an entire
2:23
array of decisions that you're going to
2:25
have to make what kind of cover art do
2:27
you want to put in it which or to put on
2:29
your book which category do you need to
2:32
go in what keywords do you use there are
2:35
so many questions and decisions that
2:37
you're going to have to make and I think
2:39
that one of the most important things
2:41
that you can do for yourself right now
2:43
is sit down and decide what it is you
2:47
want out of your self-publishing career
2:50
I know this sounds ridiculously simple
2:53
but you would be surprised how many
2:54
people don't take the time to do this
2:57
all they think is well I'd love to make
2:58
some money and I want to write my books
3:00
and put them out there which it's good
3:02
to know that but unless you get really
3:04
deep and really specific about what it
3:06
is you want out of this career like
3:08
what's your dream come true level of
3:10
success how are you going to define
3:12
success for yourself you're going to you
3:16
know be like that proverbial boat in the
3:18
storm that's just getting knocked around
3:21
by the waves and you're gonna end up off
3:23
your path maybe you wanted to go over
3:25
here and you're gonna end up way over
3:26
here and before you know it's gonna be
3:27
like what the heck just happened so what
3:31
I recommend is that you really take this
3:34
time do yourself a favor take a few
3:36
minutes to sit down in silence and think
3:40
about what it is you really want because
3:43
I'm telling you right now your answer to
3:45
that question is going to be the way you
3:48
make decisions about every other thing
3:50
in your career now why the top three
3:54
reasons why you need to know this number
3:57
one that's gonna help you come up with
3:59
your strategy for how to self-publish
4:01
and how you want to run your career
4:03
because somebody who just wants to make
4:05
as much money as fast as possible
4:07
it's going to take a very different
4:09
strategy or use a very different
4:10
strategy then somebody who just wants to
4:13
help their family pay a few bills but
4:15
they really really want to write the
4:17
specific type of
4:19
book and they don't care if they make
4:21
you know just a thousand dollars a month
4:23
whereas this person over here is not
4:25
going to be happy unless they're making
4:26
ten thousand dollars or more a month
4:28
you're going to use very different
4:29
strategies and there's gonna be very
4:31
different things that guide your
4:32
decisions because maybe this person is
4:34
willing to compromise on a few more
4:35
things to make that money whereas this
4:37
person cares more about the story
4:39
there's no right or wrong answer here
4:41
everybody is entitled to their own
4:43
dreams their own way of going out there
4:45
and making the life that they want for
4:48
themselves but you have to know what
4:50
that life is before you can start
4:52
heading toward it number two you need to
4:55
know what you aren't willing to do so I
4:58
was talking about those compromises if
5:01
you don't know what your end goal is and
5:03
what you're really striving for you're
5:06
maybe going to just try everything and
5:08
that can really hurt you in the long run
5:10
because if you're not focusing in on the
5:12
things that truly matter to get you to
5:14
where you want to go you're going to
5:16
just be trying a bunch of stuff that's
5:17
frankly gonna be a waste of your time
5:19
and some of it could actually hurt your
5:21
career know what you're willing to
5:23
compromise on and what you're just not
5:24
willing to compromise on and then stand
5:27
up for yourself and actually follow
5:28
through with that I was reading last
5:32
year a book by Todd Henry called louder
5:35
than words if you're not familiar with
5:36
him he has several amazing books on you
5:39
know being a creative entrepreneur one
5:40
is called the accidental creative and
5:42
this one of his most recent books is
5:44
called louder than words and in that
5:46
book he talks about how you know if
5:48
you're a runner and you're out on the
5:51
road you know running your marathon or
5:53
whatever you're doing and you keep your
5:56
eyes like you know where the end is for
5:58
you you know where that goal is but you
6:01
keep your eyes on the people in front of
6:05
you like ooh what's she doing well she's
6:08
running really fast well what's she
6:09
doing oh she's got those yellow shoes on
6:11
okay I'm gonna follow her if you're
6:12
watching what everybody else is doing
6:14
and trying to do what they're doing you
6:17
know what's going to happen instead of
6:18
continuing on your own path you're gonna
6:21
veer into that person's path you're
6:23
going to naturally go toward where they
6:25
are but you know what if that person in
6:28
front of you is not running this
6:30
race that you are running they don't
6:33
have the same goal that you have you're
6:35
gonna wake up one day and realize that
6:37
you follow to somebody else's dreams
6:40
that would be pretty depressing so know
6:42
what you aren't willing to compromise on
6:44
know what matters to you stay in your
6:46
own lane you have to know what you want
6:49
first in order to do that number three
6:51
if you don't define what success looks
6:54
like to you then how in the world are
6:56
you ever gonna know that you got there
6:59
in order to know hey you know what I've
7:02
reached my goal you have to know where
7:04
you're headed what you want
7:05
so absolutely make a decision about what
7:09
it is you want now that might change
7:11
over time you know you may start out
7:13
today going you know what all I really
7:15
want to do is make enough money to pay
7:18
for daycare for my children or put them
7:21
in a good school so I need like twelve
7:23
hundred dollars a month or whatever but
7:25
then as you get more successful and you
7:27
start to get into this business a little
7:29
bit more you might start realizing you
7:30
know what I want enough to move us into
7:33
this better house or I would really like
7:35
to move us to a better city where we can
7:37
have even better school so now your goal
7:39
is to make $3,000 a month it's totally
7:42
fine for those goals to change where I
7:44
see a problem with a lot of people
7:46
though is they're not changing their
7:48
goals out of desire for those things
7:51
they're changing their goals out of fear
7:54
they're afraid that they're not going to
7:57
get where they want to be they're afraid
7:58
that no one's gonna think they're
8:00
successful they're afraid of what other
8:01
people think of them they're afraid that
8:03
their sales are going down there's a
8:05
million reasons to be afraid but where
8:08
you get into trouble is when you let
8:10
that fear rule your decisions and
8:13
overrule your desires once you know what
8:16
you want and that's truly what you want
8:19
just go for it don't suddenly be like
8:22
well I've got this desire to have this
8:24
really long term strategy where I can
8:27
build this one series that I've been
8:28
dying to write my whole life but then
8:31
you get to book three and it's not
8:32
selling as well as you thought and
8:33
instead of thinking about that goal that
8:35
you had and continuing to try to build
8:37
something you jump ship and you're like
8:39
oh my gosh I think I'm gonna go and
8:40
write this other really trendy genre
8:42
that all my friends are writing and I'm
8:44
gonna see if I can make a bunch of money
8:45
doing that and you abandon your other
8:47
series well how do you know that you
8:49
weren't like one book away from that
8:51
tipping point where everything was going
8:53
to take off for you now
8:54
don't take this the wrong way I think
8:56
that I'm saying you know you should
8:57
continue on with a failing career but
9:01
what I'm saying is don't change your
9:03
entire strategy because you got scared
9:06
make sure that you know where you're
9:08
headed where you want to go so that when
9:11
it comes time to make those decisions
9:13
like when you are three books in and
9:15
your plan isn't working you can sit down
9:17
and you can go okay how can I get to
9:19
where I wanted to go do I need to write
9:20
a different series maybe it's a
9:22
different series maybe I need a
9:23
different genre but don't just freak out
9:27
and start moving and like trying like
9:30
literally throwing spaghetti at the wall
9:31
like I'm gonna try this I'm gonna try
9:33
this I'm gonna try this I have this
9:34
strategy that I was working on years ago
9:37
when the Romance Writers of America
9:40
first decided to recognize indie
9:42
publishing as a publishing career there
9:46
was an amazing talk by bella andre and
9:48
barb everything Bella Andre said
9:51
something that I will never forget she
9:53
had been traditionally publishing but
9:55
she decided she wanted to try
9:56
self-publishing and when she did she
9:59
said that she made a plan she knew
10:02
exactly what she wanted she knew that
10:04
she wanted to grow a contemporary
10:07
romance career that was the kind of
10:08
books that she really really wanted to
10:10
write she knew she wanted to write you
10:12
know family career or a family she knew
10:15
she wanted to really give it a full-time
10:17
shot she wasn't just gonna throw one or
10:19
two books out there and then like change
10:21
her strategy she said she committed to
10:24
writing eight books four books a year
10:26
one book every three months every
10:28
quarter she was gonna write a book and
10:30
she said she was gonna see that through
10:32
those eight books no matter what and she
10:37
thought even if I get to book five and
10:38
it's not doing the most amazing you know
10:40
fly off the charts I'm going to stick
10:42
with these eight books and I'm gonna do
10:44
it and guess what Bella and Ray right
10:47
now is one of the most successful
10:49
self-published authors of all time she
10:53
is right up there in
10:55
probably the top three or four in the
10:57
authors at best-selling India Thurs of
10:59
all time she did she knew what she
11:02
wanted and she didn't compromise she
11:05
committed to it and she gave everything
11:07
she had to making that happen that's why
11:09
you need a strategy but that's also why
11:11
you need to know what it is you want out
11:14
of this career so if you want to know
11:18
how to figure out what you want because
11:20
maybe you're sitting there right now and
11:21
you're going I don't know what I want I
11:23
just kind of want to make money because
11:24
we all want to make money right but
11:27
there's got to be more to it than just
11:28
that or if that's all you care about
11:31
you're gonna have a very different
11:32
strategy than somebody who wants to
11:34
change lives with their books it's gonna
11:36
all come down to what you want but if
11:39
you don't have that figured out then I
11:41
would love for you to stop by my blog
11:43
today heart breathing's calm and click
11:46
on the blog and there I have for you
11:48
some free journaling pages that you can
11:50
print out you know pour yourself a cup
11:53
of coffee or a cup of tea
11:54
and really take some time for yourself
11:56
and think through what is it that you
11:58
want and these questions are really
11:59
going to help you figure that out then
12:01
if you want in the comments on my blog
12:03
or here on youtube if you're willing to
12:05
share let me know what it is that you
12:07
want as for me when I first started this
12:10
journey I knew exactly what I wanted I
12:12
really spent a lot of time thinking
12:13
about what I wanted now it would be
12:16
great to have that movie deal and the
12:19
you know number one slot on Amazon or
12:22
you know I've Oaks or wherever but
12:24
that's not my main goal the main thing
12:27
that drives me is to write books that
12:29
really connect with readers so for that
12:31
reason I do spend more time on craft I
12:35
spend more time thinking about my
12:37
characters thinking about the stories I
12:38
want to write than I do on marketing and
12:41
that's just a choice that I've made and
12:43
there's nothing wrong with that
12:46
just because there are a lot of people
12:47
making more money than me or having more
12:49
book sales than me that doesn't bother
12:51
me because I know that I am on the path
12:53
that I want to be on I am making things
12:55
happen the way I want to make them
12:57
happen and that has really been a thread
13:03
that I've carried through my entire
13:04
career that I know I want to change
13:06
lives with my fiction
13:08
I want to touch my readers in a deep
13:09
meaningful way I want to be memorable
13:12
those are things that matter to me more
13:14
than the money and more than the fame
13:17
that comes with you know some of the
13:19
authors who do have great fame now just
13:24
taking the time to know that that's what
13:25
I want it lets me know what I'm not
13:27
willing to compromise on I'm not willing
13:29
to compromise on quality I'm not willing
13:32
to compromise on you know the way I
13:35
market my books and that has really got
13:39
guided me through my whole career so I
13:41
