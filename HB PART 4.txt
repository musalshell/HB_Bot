hey guys welcome back to heart
0:01
breathing's to be honest I am not
0:03
feeling great today
0:05
I am totally off my game and it's been
0:07
hard to be productive so what better
0:10
time than to do a video about tips for
0:12
how to write even when you don't feel
0:15
like it so obviously I haven't been
0:21
feeling like cleaning my office either
0:23
so you guys are getting a little sneak
0:24
peek of how things can get messy when
0:26
I'm on deadline and trust me what you're
0:29
seeing is not half of it because the
0:31
entire floor next to me is covered in
0:32
stuff and I haven't felt like putting it
0:35
together but when you're on deadlines
0:37
when you've got things going on when you
0:39
want to reach your goals as a writer and
0:41
finish the novel how do you keep writing
0:44
how do you find the energy or the
0:45
motivation to write when you just don't
0:48
feel like it
0:49
this is super common we all go through
0:52
this because frankly it's hard to feel
0:55
motivated to write every single day even
0:57
if you're excited about the story and
0:59
this is what you want to do with your
1:00
life more than anything on earth it can
1:03
sometimes still be difficult to find the
1:05
motivation and the creative energy to
1:07
sit down and get those words in every
1:09
single day and especially if you're in
1:12
that like hard slog of the middle of the
1:15
story and everything feels like it's
1:17
falling apart and you're just sure this
1:18
is the worst crap you've ever written in
1:20
your life yes it happens to all of us
1:22
guys it's totally normal
1:24
your story doesn't suck probably but
1:26
when you get to that hardest part or you
1:29
just don't feel like you know where
1:30
things are going you're going to be a
1:32
lot more susceptible to this whole I
1:34
don't feel like writing syndrome so I'm
1:36
gonna give you five quick tips that have
1:38
helped me over the years to write even
1:40
when I don't feel like it so number one
1:42
is to trick yourself writing when you
Trick Yourself
1:44
don't feel like it is such a mental game
1:46
and if you can get your mind into the
1:50
right space that you're taking some of
1:53
the pressure off and you can trick
1:54
yourself into actually sitting down to
1:58
write then you're way ahead of the game
2:00
so one little trick that I pull on
2:02
myself is to say okay I don't feel like
2:05
writing so I acknowledge the fact that
2:07
I'm not feeling good I don't have the
2:09
energy to sit down and write so I'll
2:10
give myself that I'll say okay
2:12
want to sit down for two hours and write
2:14
today so instead I'm just gonna write
2:16
for 10 minutes or I'm just gonna write a
2:19
hundred words and then I'll be done so
2:21
you're kind of telling yourself there's
2:24
no pressure you don't feel good you
2:25
don't have to write a lot you just have
2:27
to write a little bit right and so what
2:29
happens most of the time is you know you
2:32
you go through the trouble of sitting
2:34
down opening up your laptop or your
2:36
computer getting that file ready and you
2:38
maybe like skim through some of the
2:40
stuff you wrote last time kind of figure
2:42
out where you are set your timer for 10
2:44
minutes or check your word count so that
2:46
you know when you hit that hundred words
2:47
you're done and you start writing but at
2:50
this point the pressure and that feeling
2:52
of that way of I've got to sit down and
2:54
write for two hours or I've got to get a
2:56
thousand words or whatever it is that
2:59
you've been putting on yourself that you
3:00
just don't feel like doing that pressure
3:02
is gone now because hey you've only got
3:04
to write for 10 minutes you sit down you
3:06
write but now you have conquered the
3:09
hardest part of it which is actually
3:11
sitting down and writing and what you
3:14
will find is that if you can get past
3:16
that first 10 minutes or that first
3:18
hundred words a lot of times you can
3:20
then begin to tell yourself again like
3:22
pull this little mind trick on yourself
3:24
and say ok that wasn't so bad right I'm
3:27
gonna set the timer for another 10
3:29
minutes and see what happens and if you
3:31
just keep pushing yourself along instead
3:33
of saying oh oh I have to sit down for
3:35
two hours you can trick yourself into
3:38
chaining together those 10 minutes or
3:40
those hundred words to meet your
3:42
thousand word goal the actual act of
3:45
getting started is the hardest part so
3:47
same thing with like getting to the gym
3:49
to work out you actually get up and go
3:51
to the gym you're more likely to workout
3:53
the hardest part is getting in the car
3:55
and going to the gym right so this is
3:57
what you need to do with your writing
3:59
when you don't feel like it go through
4:01
the hardest step which is just sit down
4:02
at the computer tell yourself I don't
4:05
even care if I delete all this it can be
4:06
the worst thing I've ever written but
4:08
I'm gonna write for 10 minutes and then
4:09
I'm done take the pressure off trick
4:11
yourself and then keep writing tip
4:13
number 2 is to bribe yourself this is
Bribe Yourself
4:16
one that works really well for me
4:17
because as you can tell if you've been
4:19
watching my videos there are a lot of
4:21
little things that I love I love Hello
4:23
Kitty
4:24
I love washi tape I
4:26
colorful sticky notes and pins and
4:28
things that frankly some of it you can
4:31
get at the dollar store or for very
4:32
inexpensive but that excite me so kind
4:35
of find your own currency so to speak if
4:38
I write this hundred words I am going to
4:41
reward myself with blank and it could be
4:44
you know I get to binge watch Netflix
4:46
for the next four hours I just have to
4:48
write this thousand words or whatever it
4:50
is then I'm gonna give myself permission
4:51
to get back into bed and take a nap I
4:54
mean it could be any of those kinds of
4:56
things but I find when I bribed myself
4:58
with rewards that are things that I
5:00
actually want like you know what if I
5:03
sit down and I get this thousand words
5:04
I'm gonna go reward myself with that
5:07
sticker pack that I saw at Tuesday
5:09
morning for five dollars but if you can
5:11
figure out something that is a currency
5:14
for you that is a reward enough that
5:16
it's going to get you excited to sit
5:18
down then reward yourself bribe yourself
5:21
when you don't feel like writing say
5:22
okay today's the day I've been wanting
5:25
to listen to that podcast or I've been
5:26
wanting to go sit by the pool and read
5:28
this book but I haven't had time I'm
5:30
gonna reward myself all I have to do is
5:32
sit down and write this thousand words
5:34
and then I get to spend the rest of the
5:35
day at the pool with my book find what
5:37
works for you and bribe yourself tip
5:40
number three is to excite yourself so
5:42
what I mean by this is think ahead to a
Excite Yourself
5:46
part of the story that you've been
5:48
looking forward to writing so you might
5:50
be in that hard slog part of the story
5:53
but if you can even think of one scene
5:55
one little micro scene that you've been
5:59
really looking forward to writing this
6:00
conversation or you know this part where
6:03
she chases the bad guy through the
6:04
forest or whatever it is something that
6:06
gets you excited to sit back down and
6:08
write then give yourself permission to
6:10
be naughty and skip forward you don't
6:14
have to there are no rules that say you
6:15
have to write this entire story in order
6:17
if there's a part of a scene that you've
6:19
been looking forward to writing then
6:21
give yourself permission I'm gonna skip
6:23
over this crap I don't want to write it
6:24
that feels really hard right now because
6:26
I'm sick or I've got a headache or I'm
6:27
dealing with allergies so I'm gonna give
6:29
myself a little bit of permission to be
6:32
a bad girl and go write the scene out of
6:35
order or write that really juicy scene
6:37
at the end the truth is it doesn't even
6:39
matter if you end up using this scene
6:40
later or if this was just something that
6:42
you were writing to get yourself back in
6:44
the chair but some anything that you can
6:49
think of that excites you and gets you
6:51
to sit down is going to be a step
6:53
forward and at the more you overcome
6:56
this feeling of I don't feel like it and
6:58
this feeling I'm not motivated the more
7:00
you're going to give yourself it's like
7:03
flexing muscles right so the more you do
7:05
it the more you're going to get used to
7:08
overcoming that feeling so any way that
7:10
you can get yourself to sit down and
7:12
write at all is a win
7:13
so think about getting yourself super
7:16
excited like close your eyes think about
7:19
the scenes that are coming up and see if
7:20
you can envision any scene that gets you
7:23
a little bit excited and you know what
7:25
if you can't even do that you can't even
7:27
think of a scene that gets you excited
7:29
what about like okay what if you could
7:32
get excited about just writing something
7:34
in your character's POV so it could be
7:37
an interview with them you know what I'm
7:38
gonna ask Harper what she really thinks
7:40
about Leah and there's you know a little
7:44
bit of tension between these two
7:45
characters so I'm gonna ask her what she
7:46
really thinks about what Leah just did
7:48
and then I'm just gonna sit down and
7:49
write that that might get me excited
7:51
even though it's not something that's
7:52
gonna go into the actual novel it's
7:54
gonna be useful because it got me past
7:56
like over the hump because I what I know
7:59
to be true is that if I have a day where
8:01
I don't feel like it and then I let that
8:03
carry on into tomorrow and then tomorrow
8:05
then before you know it I've got two
8:07
weeks of getting no words done so just
8:10
overcoming that feeling today is going
8:13
to make you that much more likely to
8:14
write tomorrow even if what you write
8:16
today is not something that's going to
8:18
stay in the novel it's still character
8:20
background it's still exploring your
8:22
story and the way your characters speak
8:23
find something anything that gets you
8:26
excited to write and sit down and write
8:28
tip number four is to remove yourself so
Remove Yourself Ym going to head to the library for a while
8:32
this is another thing that really works
8:34
for me and you might find it works for
8:35
you what I love to do is you know if I
8:38
don't feel like writing maybe I do feel
8:41
like going and sitting at Barnes & Noble
8:42
and being inspired by all the books that
8:44
are surrounding me and so if I remove
8:47
myself from my current location
8:49
sometimes I will find that my mu
8:52
Changez so maybe I'm not feeling well
8:54
maybe I do have a headache and it's not
8:56
really the best day for me to be writing
8:58
but if I say okay I'm gonna grab my
9:01
laptop put all my stuff together get
9:03
dressed you know all this stuff and I'm
9:04
gonna go out and write at Starbucks or
9:07
at my local coffee shop or I'm gonna go
9:09
to the library and write for a little
9:10
bit once I'm in that setting and I've
9:12
set up my laptop and everything else I'm
9:14
much more likely to write and just like
9:16
what I said with trick yourself once you
9:19
are out of the house the hard part is
9:21
already over you're going to sit down at
9:23
Barnes & Noble and now you've driven ten
9:25
miles or whatever to get there you're so
9:26
much more likely to sit down and write
9:28
of course this one I understand is a
9:30
challenge if you live in a town that is
9:32
small or doesn't have a Barnes & Noble
9:35
or a coffee shop or something like that
9:36
that you can go to but I bet there is a
9:38
library a park some other friend's house
9:42
like maybe go to a friend's house that
9:44
also writes and say let's get together
9:45
and let's go write and you know
9:48
sometimes that can be the trick I used
9:49
to have a couple of friends when I lived
9:51
in Raleigh that I would say hey guys
9:53
let's meet up at Jason's Deli for lunch
9:55
and we'll write for a couple of hours
9:57
and that was a surefire way to get
10:00
myself writing even when I didn't feel
10:01
like it so set a date with a friend or
10:04
if you don't have a friend that's a
10:05
writer just go by yourself remove
10:07
yourself from your current location
10:09
because maybe it's all the mess in your
10:11
office or maybe it's just sitting in
10:13
your house all day or you know just the
10:16
weight of the laundry and all the other
10:18
things that need to get done that's
10:20
keeping you from having that motivation
10:22
to write so get all your favorite things
10:24
together take your favorite pens take
10:27
your laptop go out someplace that makes
10:29
you feel inspired and sit down and see
10:31
if the words will flow and my final tip
10:33
for this video is to inspire yourself so
Inspire Yourself I'm going to walk on the beach
10:36
another thing that I'd love to do
10:38
because sometimes all of those other
10:39
little tricks don't work so I just need
10:42
something to change my energy to change
10:44
my mood to get me excited about writing
10:46
again so I will find something that
10:49
inspires me it could be you know reading
10:52
a couple chapters of this great book
10:54
that I've been reading which then makes
10:56
me remember how much I love to tell
10:58
stories and makes me excited to write
11:00
even if it doesn't work for today it
11:03
might get me excited to write for
11:04
tomorrow
11:05
a lot of times if
11:06
wake up and I'm not feeling well I will
11:07
head out to the beach because that's a
11:10
place that brings me inspiration and if
11:12
you don't live near the beach what are
11:14
some other locations near you that you
11:16
could go to the end draw inspiration
11:18
from walking in the park going out just
11:22
walking in the neighborhood you could
11:23
find that going to the library inspires
11:25
you could find that going out to see a
11:26
movie inspires you going to Barnes &
11:28
Noble just like with the removing
11:30
yourself one sometimes going to Barnes &
11:32
Noble and being surrounded by books or
11:34
your local used bookstore or some other
11:35
location like that can inspire you
11:38
sometimes just going out and people
11:40
watching go downtown and watch people go
11:42
and try to imagine what you know what
11:45
conversations they're having as they
11:46
argue on their way into the grocery
11:48
store or you know someone's holding
11:50
their head down and they're wearing a
11:51
trench coat and it's not raining and you
11:53
could tell yourself stories about that
11:55
and the more you find little tricks and
11:57
little ways that you can inspire
11:59
yourself as a creator and as a
12:01
storyteller the more likely you are to
12:03
get those creative juices flowing so
12:06
that you're ready to sit down and write
12:07
again like I said sometimes you're just
12:09
not going to feel like writing but I
12:12
find that if you allow yourself to not
12:15
write when you promised that you would
12:17
you come home from work you're super
12:19
tired you just don't feel like it you
12:21
had an argument with your boss you know
12:23
there's life happens we all have hard
12:25
times but if you come home and you allow
12:28
yourself to say you know what I don't
12:30
feel like writing then Tuesday you're
12:33
gonna come home and you're gonna allow
12:34
yourself to do the same thing and
12:36
Wednesday is going to come along and
12:37
you're gonna you know just spiral and
12:39
allow yourself to do the same thing and
12:41
you could live your entire life allowing
12:44
yourself to say I don't feel like
12:46
writing but if you look ahead to this
12:49
future life that you really want to have
12:51
and the reason why you want to be a
12:52
writer you will see how toxic it can be
12:56
and how heartbreaking it can be to fast
12:58
forward a year or two years down the
13:00
road and not have moved truly moved
13:02
forward in your novel if this is
13:04
something that you truly really
13:06
desperately want for your life then
13:08
you're gonna have to find little tricks
13:10
and little ways to get yourself writing
13:13
even when you don't feel like it because
13:14
if you are creator and if you want to be
13:16
a novelist or a greater of anything
13:19
really and you have to create you have
13:21
to do it even when you don't feel like
13:24
it especially if you want to make a
13:25
living at this because you know even
13:27
though the money will continue to come
13:28
in for a little while if you stop
13:30
creating a lot of times the money stops
13:32
flowing as well so you know if this is
13:34
something that you want to do whether
13:36
it's just to feed your soul or whether
13:37
it's to feed your family if you can
13:39
master the trick of writing even when
13:42
you don't feel like it whether you're
13:43
tricking yourself bribing yourself
13:45
leaving and changing locations you know
13:49
to get into a different mental space
13:50
refilling the well which is the inspire
13:53
part like find something that makes you
13:55
motivated or just skipping ahead and
13:56
writing out of order because it gets you
13:58
excited the more you can flex that
14:00
muscle of writing when you just don't
14:02
feel like it you are going to get so
14:04
much more done and you're going to start
14:06
to give yourself the power and the
14:08
confidence of okay I know I don't feel
14:10
like writing but I know that I have
14:12
tools and ways to get around that and
14:14
that's what the professional writer does
14:17
is we write even when we don't feel like
14:19
it and yes there are going to be days
14:21
where the words are not flowing and
14:23
every minute of it feels like the chore
14:25
and it feels like the words are not as
14:28
good as you want them to be but that's
14:30
just part of the process and give
14:32
yourself you know permission sometimes
14:34
for these not to be the most like
14:36
Shakespearean amazing words that you've
14:37
ever written in your life it's part of
14:39
the process you can go back and edit
14:41
them later but just don't allow yourself
14:43
to string days and days and days and
14:45
days where you're not writing at all
14:47
because you don't feel like it because
14:49
you could literally waste your entire
14:50
life not feeling like it I hope that
14:53
these tips have helped you guys these
14:55
are definitely things that work for me
14:56
if you have any other great tips that
14:58
helped you get writing even when you
15:00
don't feel motivated to write please add
15:02

15:18
because I realized these tips are great
15:20
for Nano because really in order to win
15:22
Nano you need to be writing pretty much
15:23
every day of November and the likelihood
15:25
that you're gonna feel like writing
15:27
every single day in November
15:28
is very low so hopefully these tips will
15:31
help you get through NaNoWriMo as well
15:33
but I'd love to hear in the comments if

welcome back for the fifth and final video of our writing great scenes series
0:05
so over the past few weeks we've been going over what are the main elements of
0:10
a scene how do you write a character's goal or desire how do you write conflict in a scene and really ramp it up so that
0:17
readers are turning pages into the night and then our last video we discussed the actual structure of a scene the
0:23
beginning middle and end and how do you create scene cards from your structure
0:29
and from your ideas so today what we're going to do is we're going to kind of pull back and take an eagle eye view and
0:34
we're going to say how do you take any scene cards that you've created and create an entire novel out of it so this
0:42
is going to be a fun video i hope you enjoy it let's get started
0:50
so first things first i do want to stress the fact that you don't actually
0:55
need to or have to make scene cards for your novel you don't have to plot things out in advance
1:01
some people love it it works for some writers to know their story before they get started and be able to just write
1:07
from a stack of scene cards and it doesn't work for other writers so your job is to learn as much as you can and
1:14
then figure out your own unique process and don't judge yourself if you don't
1:19
use scene cards totally fine you can still write a novel that is amazing where some people tend to use their note
1:25
cards is not in the writing process but in the editing process when they've got their novel but it's still kind of a
1:31
mess and they want to really put it all in order so whether you're looking at this video as a way to get a better
1:38
handle on your writing process or your editing process it's my hope not to tell you how i think you should do it but how
1:46
i do it and hope that you can pull something from that or that it helps you in some way so
1:52
i realized when i was sort of outlining this video that this is a difficult thing to explain your process of how you
2:00
get your ideas and how you string them together into a novel so i'm going to do the best that i can but definitely let
2:06
me know down in the comments below if this resonated with you if anything you know you're missing a piece of it or
2:11
you want to see the process with more examples because i would be happy to talk about that more in the future but
Get An Eagle Eye View
2:18
one of the first things that i like to do when i already have created some of
2:23
the scene cards is i will take an eagle eye view by
2:28
looking at my plotting method and the different plot points that i'm trying to hit and pairing my scene cards up with
2:36
those major plot points this is what's going to help me identify where's the holes where are the gaps where i need to
2:42
figure out how do we get from point a to point b because i don't have those scenes filled out yet and so i
2:49
personally use the three act structure so i'm looking for things like what's the opening hook image what's the
2:56
argument against transformation where is my mystery introduced or the antagonist introduced and what's the first doorway
3:04
and then i'll ask things like what is the midpoint or the big climax that
3:09
happens in the center of the novel what is that act two doorway that leads us
3:14
into the allah's lost moment and that final climax so i'm going to be looking as i
3:20
sort through the note cards that i've already created from last week's video and i'm going to start pairing those up
3:27
with those plot points there are so many different methods of plotting a novel so
3:33
i use the three-act structure if you want to hear more about what i use or you want to download my free workbook on
3:39
how to plot your novel i will link all of that down for you below because i have a whole series of videos on that
3:44
plotting method but maybe you use save the cat maybe use the snowflake method there are so many different methods of
3:52
plotting and different terminology that you can use so it doesn't matter which one you're using just the one that resonates for you start with your stack
3:59
of note cards and start pairing them up with those plot points
4:05
then i'll also like i said i'll put them in chronological order and of course there are stories sometimes that aren't
4:10
fully chronological so you might have to play with that depending on the novel you're writing so my book the
4:16
disappearance of vanessa shaw that i've been working on in the past is
4:21
told in alternate timelines you have a chronological order of the present and then you have a chronological order of
4:26
what's happening in the past and then you have to weave those together so what i would do in that case is i would create one timeline chronologically and
4:34
then another and then i would start pairing them up with my plot to weave them together for maximum drama in the
4:40
story then you could say okay when you start looking you could say what are the most dramatic scenes what scenes are
4:47
going to create the most change in the trajectory of the story or in my character's life or their need to grow
4:54
and these are going to be usually scenes that are related to your genre so if
4:59
you're writing a mystery what's the most dramatic mystery moment it's going to be
5:04
a dead body it's going to be a huge new clue that just throws the story in a whole new direction
5:10
if you're writing a romance it's going to be that first kiss or the first time they tell each other they love each
5:16
other so you can pair up the most dramatic scenes with those big plot points right
5:23
because if you have the first dead body on the page maybe that is your opening
5:28
scene or your opening hook or it could be the introduction of the mystery the first time we see a dead body right
5:34
usually the most dramatic scenes in your book are gonna pair up with those big
5:40
plot points right the first time your couple kisses might be the doorway into act two so often i'll look for those big
5:48
moments or the big moments where my character is gonna be thrown for a loop or they're going to be
5:53
asked to change or something like that what are the biggest obstacles that my character is going to face chances are
6:00
the biggest ones are going to be that climax moment or some other big moment in your story okay so let's talk about
Brainstorm Scenes
6:08
what do you do though if you don't actually know any scenes yet you just kind of have a
6:14
mostly informed idea of what's happening in this story so every writer starts
6:19
kind of differently in how they develop stories for me i usually see a moment or a scene in the book it'll be a witch
6:26
walking with roses trailing behind her and it sparks something so there's
6:32
usually for me starts with a scene but some people start with a setting and some people start with a character and
6:38
so wherever you start what i recommend is writing down as much as you can see
6:44
or imagine in your mind about that story so far and from that journaling and that
6:49
sort of brain dump you're going to start to naturally come up with scenes or scenarios or conversations that are
6:55
going to happen in your story and so when you start doing that i kind of treat it like a meditation in a way so i
7:03
will actually get myself into a really calm state of mind a creative state of
7:08
mind and i just close my eyes and i start to imagine that character going through their life what is the main
7:15
story here and again this is going to be often guided by the genre that you're writing
7:20
now if you don't know which genre you're writing that's something you'll want to figure out kind of early on like what's
7:25
the shape of this story am i writing a romance in k in that case i need to start thinking about romantic scenes and
7:32
who this you know how this couple gets together what are the obstacles between them if you're writing a young adult paranormal
7:39
fantasy then there's going to be some kind of magic system in here and there's going to be some kind of conflict maybe
7:45
with an evil creature or some kind of big bad right so the genre and the type and the shape of story that you're
7:51
writing is going to start to naturally bring up scenes scenarios and dialogue for you and then what i'll often do is
7:59
just sit in silence and sometimes i come back to this several days in a row and make sure that you have either your note
8:05
cards or a notebook nearby so that you can write out any image that comes to
8:10
mind every single thing captured on the page because even just a snippet of a girl walking through a closet touching
8:17
these beautiful white clothes might be an entire scene in your book that could be pivotal so
8:23
don't discount anything write it all down and then what i do is i ask myself the
8:28
following questions who is my character at the beginning of this book like who are they and what's
8:35
going to be their main obstacle in this book what problem are they gonna have to solve who are they going to meet these
8:42
kinds of questions and then i'll say what what's their goal what's their goal and what's standing in their way
8:48
and why does it matter to them why do they care so this is very much those ideas of like what's your character's
8:53
goal what's their motivation what's their reason why and what's the obstacle to it and then i'll also be asking
8:59
myself and what's at stake here like who is this person that if they fail at reaching their goal
9:06
they're going to you know what's what's at stake they're going to lose their family they're going to live their life
9:11
unhappy they're never going to break free of their past like what is at stake for them and then i will write down a
9:18
list often of what's the worst thing that could happen to this character in relationship to this goal and their the
9:24
obstacle that's facing them is it death is it um you know that they lose their
9:29
family that they lose their job you know what is it that i can write out that's going to be like
9:35
from bad to worse to absolute worst and devastation because sometimes that will spark scene ideas like oh yeah she's
9:42
gotta lose her job so that'll be the act one climax she's gonna lose her job because of this guy
9:47
and now she has to confront him and then they fall in love like whatever it is but that will start to spark things for
9:52
you once you've started sparking things then go back to last week's video with
9:57
scene structure and see if you can fill out scene cards that tell you well here's the overview of the scene here's
10:03
my character's goal in the scene here's the conflict that they're facing and here's the outcome that leads us into
10:09
the next scene so once you have some of that stuff now you're caught up with us over here with our stack of scene cards
10:16
and then go through the previous process of pairing those up with those major plot points so the next part of the
Fill In The Gaps
10:23
process for me is filling in the gaps so for this section what i'm going to do is i'm actually going to move to a top-down
10:31
view and i'm going to share with you some scene cards that i created just for this that are about my book the witch's
10:37
key so since we were going through this as an example last week i'll continue on with that so i'll share with you some of
10:43
the scene cards that i might have to start out with and how i identify and fill in the gaps
10:50
okay i'm excited to share this process with you of how i go from just like one
10:55
or two note cards to having a plot for my entire novel and then writing the book so this is my plotting notebook so
11:02
i tend to have this and my note cards kind of all the time i also have a workbook where i have some stuff about
11:10
the characters and then all the plotting points that i tend to look for in a story so if you want a copy of this you
11:16
can sign up for my newsletter and it's inside my resource library okay so i already tried to record this once which
Example of Scene Cards
11:22
is why you see some of these numbers on here and i don't want to remake the note cards but bear with me here for just a minute let's say after my brainstorming
11:29
and meditation i know three things that are happening in the first act let's say i know for sure that peyton
11:36
lenny's new friend is going to get kidnapped because the shape of this story is that there are girls who've
11:42
been kidnapped lenny knows that it's something paranormal involved and she doesn't want to get involved argument
11:47
against transformation because that's how her parents died was doing this kind of work but she also has to because she
11:54
cares so much about this new friend that she feels like she needs to look into it to save her friend
12:00
so this is going to be the key event this will be the thing that draws my character into the story and sometimes
12:06
when i'm plotting i start with those big dramatic moments okay this is the shape of the story her friend is kidnapped now
12:13
the rest of the story she's going to investigate this murder so if i know this scene that peyton's kidnapped and
12:19
this is when lenny finds out about it and this is when she decides that she's going to investigate i know that's the
12:26
first doorway of no return and the key event so i can kind of match up what i
12:31
have so far on note cards with any type of plot point i might have on this list
12:37
so let's say i only know two other scenes i know that lenny is i've got a scene idea where lenny's arriving at
12:43
school and she first meets peyton so where does that belong that could be my opening scene so i'll kind of set
12:49
that here and then i can see in my head a scene where this tallnark mysterious guy that she meets named kai is
12:56
confronting her about kind of getting involved in things that she doesn't understand so he's standing out in front
13:02
of her house this is one of those scenes that i could like see in my head he's standing there but why i may not know
13:07
100 yet so that's chronologically going to happen somewhere between her seeing
13:12
him for the first time in this scene and peyton getting kidnapped because i'm kind of setting him up as a
13:19
potential like red herring slash partner in this whole thing so if i know these three scenes where i
13:26
would start with this is i would ask myself okay i've got these chronologically but is this scene
13:32
the first scene of my novel she's cast this invisibility spell she's arriving at school
13:38
when i start to think through it i really know that i need to set up her relationship with
13:45
uncle martin the guy that her uncle that she's been staying with since her parents died and i want to set up the
13:51
title of the book the witch's key her the ab like her magic powers and i want to make sure the
13:58
reader knows right from the start how lenny's parents died like introduced that mystery of what happened to her
14:04
parents so my opening scene or my hook is not going to be this arriving at
14:10
school but instead it's going to be just a brief scene where she's getting ready for school and uncle martin gives her
14:16
back her witch's key which unlocks her magic that the council has been keeping
14:21
from her as they've investigated her parents death so this tells us that she's been cleared of any wrongdoing and
14:27
she has access to her magic again and so this is kind of a foundational scene and
14:32
it's much more of a hook of a scene because we get introduced to this cool idea of magic being locked behind a key
14:39
so that's going to be my opening scene so i would label this as a one i wouldn't put lenny's name up here at the
14:45
top because i have don't have multiple pov but if i was writing lots of different characters i would color code
14:50
these with the character's name here at the top so i know this is the opening scene this scene is the next scene so she cast
14:56
the invisibility spell and now she goes to school but peyton sees through it so i've got those two
15:03
the next scene that i know is kai confronting her well she at the end of this scene she's just now seeing him for
15:10
the first time so i definitely have a gap here because he has nothing to confront her for yet i also have a
15:16
massive gap between her just meeting peyton and her caring enough about
15:21
peyton that she's willing to literally risk her life to save her so i need
15:27
a few things i need a reason for kai to confront her and i need a reason for her to care so
15:34
much about peyton that she's willing to risk her life so i need a series of scenes that form this purpose right all while also
15:42
setting up any of the mystery that i happen to know later in the story are there any other red herrings or
15:48
potential witnesses potential further victims what else do i need to set up before we get out of act
15:56
one to make the rest of the story work so for one thing i need to set up some situations where
16:02
she's getting closer to peyton right so throughout this depending on what your story is you might be asking
16:08
yourself questions about is there are there any other relationships that need to be set up before we move into act two
16:16
are there any other pieces of the mystery like clues or potential red
16:21
herrings or potential culprits like bad guys that we need to set up here if it's
16:27
a romance are there any points of where our character is now
16:32
that i need to show what they're faced with now so that i can properly show their transformation
16:38
later in the story and if it's a you know fantasy or something you might want to be setting up the
16:44
world building a little bit more or setting up how your character's life is now and how that's going to lead into
16:49
their grand adventure or whatever it may be but as you start going through it chronologically you should be able to
16:55
ask yourself is there anything between this scene and this scene that needs to come into the story relationships
17:02
mysteries all of that so i would add some scenes here so for example
17:07
i would say okay i want to have a scene like in my head i just let whatever envisions you know come up for me i will
17:15
use so i'll say oh i can see the girls sitting together at a coffee shop what if there was a really fun cool coffee
17:22
shop that all the cool kids go to after school let's call it serbine which is going to be really fun because they're
17:27
the newcastle nights and it'll be kind of a funny little place that they love to hang out
17:32
so peyton at school invites lenny to serbian
17:37
and this happens maybe at lunch or something like that just a brief scene where she invites her to go
17:42
so one thing is i wouldn't necessarily need after she
17:47
gets to school to have scenes that walk her chronologically through the day she we don't need to see her going to the
17:53
bathroom and going to math class and going to lunch unless there's some kind of piece of that scene that moves the story
17:59
forward towards these bigger plot points right so if i'm going to have a scene where
18:04
peyton invites lenny to serbine it probably also needs to have some kind of conflict or some kind of extra to it so
18:10
i might want to brainstorm that later and say well maybe uncle martin doesn't allow her to go or maybe she has some
18:17
other kind of conflict so i may not know that but i'll put the placeholder here that she's got an invitation and then
18:22
after that i'm going to actually show them going to sarbine so at this particular scene i would write down a
18:29
bunch of notes because there's a lot of things that are going to happen at this coffee shop not only tying into the fact that kai works there
18:38
and lenny gets this crazy idea that if she could get some saliva from him from his
18:43
straw she could do a little magical spell on him that she could tell what kind of creature he is maybe he's a
18:49
vampire maybe he's a demon and she wants to know and so her curiosity gets the better of her and she steals his straw
18:55
so dun dun dun now i have something for him to confront her with so is there anything that needs to happen between
19:02
her stealing the straw and finding out more about the mystery and him confronting her well let's say she has
19:08
to do something with the straw right do i want her to actually cast the spell and figure out what kind of creature he is maybe so i that's how i would start
19:16
building my scenes is what then what happens then what what next what next is there anything i need to do to fill in
19:22
these gaps and spoiler alert she does cast a spell on the straw but it doesn't say what he is
19:29
so the mystery continues to thicken around this guy then he's standing out in front he confronts her and now i've
19:35
connected that opening scene with the next scene that i knew in my story and
19:41
this what happens here is one of the big things that she realizes in the conflict
19:46
and outcome of the scene is that one he's just as scared as she is which is a
19:51
surprise to her and two he knows about what happened to her family which just increases the mystery
19:58
around this guy and is going to have a reaction from her so as you're plodding through you might also be thinking about
20:05
how does my character react to this scene and that can lead you into what happens next so then i would ask like okay so is
20:12
there any other thing that needs to happen with kai or uncle martin or her magic or are there any other characters
20:19
that need to be introduced and is her relationship to peyton strong enough to justify this big leap
20:27
i don't think so just yet so maybe i'm going to add another scene um maybe i would add another couple scenes here
20:33
where she has another night with peyton or they share some
20:38
kind of emotional moment that really ties my character in not just hey we're hanging out at a coffee shop but like
20:44
she gets to know something about peyton's past that resonates with her that makes her deeply
20:49
care for this girl and so i would just build my scenes like that and
20:54
write it sit down and write it and once this first act was done i'm probably going to have ideas as to what's going
21:02
to happen in the second act and what's the reaction what's the plan what's the other attacks that happen and so on and
21:09
that's basically how i create my note cards and go through it and it's it's a difficult process to kind of explain but
21:15
i sincerely hope that this was helpful for you and that it helps you gain a little bit of clarity on what to do so it's not so
21:21
much a matter of following your character day-to-day through every little thing they do but it's about
21:27
really identifying what are the big moments of the story that i need to set up and then bridging the gap or filling
21:33
in the gaps between the characters motivation and the clues that need to come in and the
21:38
relationships that need to be established in order to make the story flow in a logical manner so that's how i
21:44
do it now that we have our scene cards we filled in as many of the gaps as possible you can trust that when you
Start Writing
21:52
feel excited to start writing and you really start to see it play through your mind that you're ready to start working
21:58
on either your edits or your writing for me i don't have every scene filled out
22:03
from the beginning of the story all the way to the end i will have a stack usually of scene cards that are
22:09
scattered throughout the entire story when i start filling in the gaps and then usually i'll try to fill in every
22:16
scene that happens in act one and once i have all of act one figured out and then
22:22
i have a little bit of act two and then i figure out kind of where i think the climax is going to be usually i'm ready
22:28
to start writing now for some writers you might fill out every single like 40 50 note cards for the entire c like
22:35
scenes before you even start writing for some of you you don't need these scene cards at all until your edits and that's
22:41
okay your process is your process so honor that and be proud of yourself and keep moving forward so my process is
22:47
having those kind of major plot points for the end of the story but having as much of act 1 as possible down so then
22:55
once i'm ready to write i come armed with my detailed scene cards usually i will put a little
23:01
hole punch right here in the corner i'll put them on one of those book rings so that i don't lose them or they don't get
23:06
out of order when my daughter comes to play with them and write on them and all those kinds of things and i will sit
23:12
down get myself into a place where i'm ready to write and i will look at the scene
23:17
that i'm going to be writing today or the scene that i'm going to write first and i almost always start with a movie
23:24
in my head so i will close my eyes and i will imagine my character playing
23:30
through that scene like it's a movie in my head and i will listen for any dialogue that
23:36
comes up any character that comes up and i don't have to play through the whole scene but i'll just play through the opening of that scene what's that hook
23:43
of that scene so lenny's going to school for the first day she thinks she's invisible no one's noticing her and then
23:48
here comes this bubbly blonde girl who notices her and won't stop talking to her and that's all i need is that visual
23:55
in my head i'm a very visual person and i am ready to write so i will as i sit down to write i will make sure that that
24:03
opening hook is in my mind as a scene the reader can
24:09
so then i'm ready to sit down so i will have that visual in my head make sure that it feels like a hook that it you
24:15
know i'm writing it to make sure that it brings the reader in and draws them in and then i focus on as i'm going through
24:22
it what's the obstacle and how does my character feel as they're moving through this and of course there's really no way
24:28
to plan out every single word that's going to be said because once you've done that you've already written the book so just trust
24:36
as those voices flow through your head as those scenes flow through your head just write what's on the page and
24:41
remember that you can always change it later just because it's on a scene card doesn't mean this is the way it has to
24:47
be and a lot of times the reason that i don't plot so far ahead to the later ends of the book is because as i'm
24:53
writing the scenes changed i thought this was going to be about peyton but here's this
24:58
other guy and he's mysterious and where did he come from and sometimes that's the most exciting part is when a new
25:04
character is revealed or a new mystery comes up or a new conflict comes up so
25:09
have that visual in your head and make sure that you're focused as you begin writing on okay the opening really draws
25:15
my reader in and then i'm gonna focus on the conflict both the internal conflict going on inside my character she doesn't
25:22
want to be seen she doesn't this is not how things were supposed to go but also
25:27
that external conflict wow there's these missing girls everybody's on edge everybody's scared and here's this new
25:33
guy who happened to arrive at school right at the time these girls started missing going missing and now he's staring right
25:40
at you like i focus on that level of conflict so that i'm pulling that thread through as i'm writing and every word
25:47
every conversation is leading me toward that outcome of the scene and i've got that in my mind as i'm writing and this
25:54
is such a difficult thing to really explain the process because it's so intuitive and personal to each person
26:00
but i think that's the best way i can do it is i have my mind on the conflict and
26:05
what's going on in my character like inside my character and their emotions and their feelings but i'm always
26:11
thinking about every moment is leading me to that outcome he's standing there and he's staring right at you and i'm
26:18
building up to that both in my pacing in my conversation and in the movement of my character if it's a scene that really
26:25
shakes my character to their core in some way i also will make sure that i add a little sequel moment where they
26:31
process what just happened they figure out where to go next and so that's kind of a scene transition that i don't
26:37
always have written on my scene cards but it's more of an intuitive thing like okay i need a little bit of processing
26:42
moment here and now i'm going to move on to the next scene so once a scene is finished i will look at my note cards
26:49
and and i will say does this make sense to move straight to that or do i need something to bridge
26:55
the gap and sometimes when i'm plotting and planning i can't see that i need to already have the scene on the page and
27:01
know how it unfolded and flowed to be able to see okay what happens next okay
27:07
i need a scene here where she's got to go talk to her teacher or she needs to reach out to uncle martin because this
27:12
has really shaken her up and so i just will create new scene cards so that when i'm going through my edits i have a
27:19
record of what actually happened in the story and i don't judge if something needs to change and i always keep in
27:26
mind that i'm just writing a rough draft maybe if this scene doesn't belong i can
27:31
delete it later or change it if i decide okay now i know what the next scene is i make sure when i sit down to write that
27:38
next scene that i acknowledge any passage of time any change in setting
27:43
and i start again with a new hook so if it's the end of the school day and now they're at sarbine i make sure that i
27:50
let the reader know right away that we're no longer at school it's a few hours later and they're at this coffee
27:55
shop and i can use all the senses so i'll think about the noise in the coffee
28:01
shop the people the way that lenny feels as she's sitting there and i'll focus on the conversation with the people that
28:06
that she's sitting with at the table and so that kind of thing will draw your reader into that scene and be create a
28:13
smooth transition from one scene to the next and then that's basically how i write a novel so i will have all those
28:20
scenes figured out fill in the gaps and i will sit down and write them as i'm writing it's a fluid thing plot is ever
28:28
changing ever shifting so every time i finish a scene i'll ask myself does this change what i had planned and if so how
28:36
and i'll really just trust that inner voice that intuition that says you need a more calm scene before you jump into
28:42
this action or you need a moment between these two if you're going to strengthen their relationship before you move on to
28:50
the next piece of action or there's a conversation that needs to happen to make this logically flow and i will just
28:55
follow that as i write my rough draft and every time i end a scene i reevaluate see how it feels move on to
29:02
the next scene and make sure that there's a good flow and sometimes if i can't figure out the jump or the flow
29:07
then i just keep moving forward and i can fix that in my edits and so that's a
29:14
video for another day but i write my entire novel this way i'm always thinking about what's my
29:20
character's goal who are they in the scene who are they becoming who are they transforming into and what is the
29:27
outcome that i'm leading to what's that symbol crash or that new discovery or that thing that's going to change the
29:32
story or change them and then i flow my way to it take a pause try to figure out what
29:38
happens next and i just keep moving forward by the time i get to the end of my act one scene cards usually i've
29:45
already got more ideas so i will take a moment and i will start writing out okay what's their reaction to this how am i
29:51
going to get them from here to the midpoint and i basically go through that same process i was talking about before
29:57
where i fill in the gaps by going through the steps what needs to be set up now how do
30:02
i play off of what happened before and bring that in as a thread and it becomes a very back and forth process between my
30:10
scene cards my plot my rough draft so far and just make my way through the
30:15
entire novel that way so i know i wish i could give more details but i think that's the best way i can explain it so
Final Thoughts
30:21
i hope this look at the scene cards how i fill in the gap and how i get into the mental space of writing has been helpful
30:28
for you and in fact i hope this entire scene series has been helpful for you if it has definitely make sure that you

31:21
will see you guys in my next video bye [Music]
31:44
you
hey everybody welcome back to heart
0:01
breathing so today is part four of our
0:04
writing great scenes series and this is
0:07
really where everything we've talked
0:08
about so far with your character's goal
0:10
and conflict and desire it's all going
0:13
to come together today and we're going
0:14
to talk about how you structure your
0:16
scenes and how they're put together
0:18
which is really going to help you figure
0:19
out what happens in your novel so i'm
0:22
really excited to talk about this let's
0:24
get started
0:29
so earlier in the series i mentioned
0:31
that scenes are really like micro
0:34
stories in your book their mini stories
0:37
and so in the same way that your reader
0:39
progresses from scene to scene to scene
0:42
your character is progressing on this
0:44
journey that they have to go from who
0:46
they are and whatever their situation is
0:48
at the beginning of the story to who
0:50
they need to become by the end of it in
0:52
order to win the story or to end the
0:55
story in some way in many ways scenes
0:58
are going to mirror the overarching
1:00
story so your character usually has some
1:02
kind of goal that
1:04
carries throughout the entire storyline
1:07
right so this is their big goal to save
1:09
the person to prove their innocence you
1:11
know there's some overarching goal but
1:13
that goal plays out inside scenes step
1:17
by step by step so when you think about
1:19
the structure of your scene it's often
1:21
helpful to be thinking about the fact
1:23
that this scene is one step on the
1:26
pathway and in terms of my character's
1:29
overall goal the overall conflict of the
1:31
story this scene needs to have one small
1:35
piece of it so you're putting together
1:36
this large puzzle and each scene is a
1:39
tiny piece of that conflict or a
1:41
stepping stone to what needs to happen
1:43
next in the story and that can often be
1:45
helpful helpful when it comes to
1:47
deciding what happens in the story and
1:49
figuring out how to structure it and
1:51
also in the same way with a larger novel
1:53
that you have learned about a beginning
1:55
a middle and an end we're going to
1:57
discuss the beginning middle and end of
2:00
scene structure so hopefully this is
2:02
really going to help you if you have
2:03
struggled with this in the past so let's
2:06
start with the beginning of a scene
Hook
2:08
similar to how your entire novel often
2:11
will start with some kind of hook that
2:14
re brings the reader in
2:16
every scene in your story can also have
2:18
a hook so it's some kind of opening
2:20
sentence or paragraph that really
2:22
grounds your reader into the who what
2:25
where
2:26
type scenario that you're dealing with
2:28
in the story so who's talking what are
2:30
they dealing with what's their goal so
2:33
remember in video two we talked a lot
2:35
about your character's goal or desire
2:37
the beginning of your scene is often
2:39
where you really let your reader know
2:41
this is what my character's after and it
2:43
doesn't have to be a statement of this
2:45
is what i want in this scene it can be
2:48
implied it can be pretty obvious when
2:50
your character walks into the office you
2:52
know because of what's happened just
2:54
before that they're looking for some
2:56
kind of clue and that is the goal of the
2:58
scene so often it's implied or it's
3:01
inherent based on what's happened before
3:03
what this goal is but it's important in
3:06
most scenes unless you're doing
3:07
something to specifically keep it a
3:09
secret from your reader because of the
3:11
type of story you're telling to let the
3:13
reader know what is my character's goal
3:15
in this scene so hook them in get them
3:18
interested and of course there are lots
3:19
of different ways to hook your reader
3:22
this can be starting with action right
3:24
from the first sentence this could be an
3:25
interesting piece of dialogue it could
3:27
be your character's fear that they're
3:29
going to get caught and so it's that
3:31
internal monologue what if i get caught
3:33
that's an interesting hook into a scene
3:35
because now you're already drawn into
3:37
that conflict right from the start so
3:39
you have lots of tools as to how you can
3:41
hook people in but the key in the
3:43
beginning of a scene is to really ground
3:45
the reader in what's going on who's
3:47
talking and what's my character trying
3:50
to accomplish in this scene another part
3:52
of the hook and the goal of course is
3:55
also
3:56
does your reader understand what's at
3:58
stake so if you start out with what if i
4:00
get caught hopefully because of what's
4:02
come before the reader will understand
4:04
what's at stake but sometimes in this
4:05
beginning part you might want to have a
4:07
moment of dialogue or inner monologue
4:09
where your reader reminds us like if i
4:12
fail at this thing or if i don't get
4:13
this information or if i don't
4:16
escape here's what's going to happen to
4:18
me so your reader should be aware of
4:19
what's at stake if your character fails
4:22
and all of that happens usually towards
4:24
the beginning of your scene so now we
4:25
move into the middle of your scene this
Middle
4:28
is the meat of the scene this is the
4:30
longest part of a scene just like the
4:31
middle of your novel is the longest part
4:33
of your novel and this part of your
4:36
scene is usually focused on the conflict
4:38
so this is of course everything we
4:40
talked about in video three so if you
4:42
haven't watched those earlier sessions
4:44
or parts of this series i highly
4:46
recommend that you head back to watch
4:49
those i'll put that playlist down below
4:50
for you so remember that conflict is
4:52
basically the obstacle to your
4:54
character's goal and that's going to be
4:55
the main like middle part now in some
4:58
scenes this conflict is going to be an
5:00
actual battle like it could be a
5:02
struggle you walk into the your
5:04
character walks into an office trying to
5:07
figure out some kind of secret
5:08
information they're scared they're going
5:09
to get caught so we know their goal we
5:11
know what's at stake for them if they
5:13
get caught and then in the middle of the
5:15
scene someone does actually walk in and
5:17
catch them and there's an actual
5:19
struggle maybe there's a gun in the desk
5:21
drawer and the gun goes off so it can be
5:23
an actual struggle of what happens it
5:26
also could be something much more subtle
5:28
depending on what you need this scene to
5:30
be in terms of the stepping stones of
5:32
your story because whatever that
5:35
conflict is that stands in their way in
5:37
this scene it is going to have some kind
5:40
of ripple effect there's always a cause
5:43
and effect so whatever happens in this
5:45
scene in terms of the conflict and the
5:47
ending which we'll talk about in a
5:48
second it's going to lead us into what
5:51
happens next just like you're taking
5:53
steps down a path so the middle of the
5:55
scene is what's standing in your
5:57
character's way so then when we get to
5:59
the end of a scene what we're mostly
Outcome
6:01
looking at is what's the outcome of this
6:03
conflict the gun went off
6:05
what happened does your character get
6:07
away are they captured are they injured
6:10
what is the outcome now km island in her
6:13
book called structuring your novel which
6:14
i highly highly recommend and have left
6:16
a link for you down below she calls this
6:18
the disaster and of course not every
6:21
single scene is going to end in complete
6:23
disaster but if you want to keep
6:25
creating obstacles for your character
6:27
and you want to make the story
6:28
interesting you do need to have things
6:31
not work out the way that your character
6:33
planned for them to work out and
6:34
sometimes it can even work out but that
6:37
working out has now caused them a new
6:39
problem right so what is the outcome of
6:42
your scene and again this can happen and
6:45
be something very subtle or it can be
6:47
something huge like your character shot
6:49
and now they're blacking out and we're
6:52
gonna see them again next time when they
6:53
wake up in a hospital or in some kind of
6:56
dungeon or prison cell or whatever it is
6:58
so whatever this outcome of your scene
7:00
is the outcome of the obstacle so you
7:03
have the beginning which is the hook you
7:05
let your reader know what your
7:06
character's goal is then you have the
7:08
middle which is where we develop the
7:09
conflict whatever obstacle is standing
7:11
in your character's way appears and they
7:13
deal with it they interact with it and
7:15
then the outcome is the ending of your
7:18
scene which is basically how did that
7:20
conflict get resolved in this moment and
7:23
then of course whatever that outcome is
7:26
is going to lead to the next scene in
7:28
your story the way i think about endings
7:30
too is that in some way your character
7:32
needs to be left off balance or they
7:36
need to be left with some kind of
7:37
feeling of what am i going to do next
7:40
this didn't go the way i wanted i need a
7:42
new plan or this wasn't how i planned
7:44
for things to be and now i have to
7:47
change who i am in some way so it leaves
7:49
your character off balance it creates
7:51
some kind of change either in who your
7:53
character is or what their plan was or
7:55
what their goals were to begin with and
7:58
that change is what leads us into
8:01
them making a different decision in the
8:03
next scene so i also wanted to talk
8:05
about the symbol crash when it comes to
8:07
the ending of a scene i cannot remember
Symbol Crash
8:10
where i first heard this particular term
8:13
but i think that it was from libby
8:15
hawker's book take off your pants which
8:17
is a book about uh pantsers who want to
8:20
learn how to plot a little bit better so
8:22
i will leave a link for that book down
8:24
below but i think i also have heard
8:25
james scott bell kind of talk about this
8:27
idea of a symbol crash and i always
8:29
think about this when i'm writing
8:31
chapters in particular but also scenes
8:34
that it can really keep your reader
8:37
turning pages in fact it's one of the
8:39
greatest tools that you have in your
8:41
writer's toolbox to keep readers staying
8:43
up all night continue to turn pages be
8:45
super engaged in the story is at the end
8:48
of your scene you have some kind of
8:50
symbol crash so the reader's following
8:53
you along and then there's a single
8:55
sentence or phrase or something that
8:57
happens at the end of that scene that
8:59
really hits you in the gut that has a
9:01
moment of resonance or something extra
9:04
to it that makes your reader go what oh
9:06
my gosh now i have to know exactly what
9:07
happens next and you can do this in all
9:10
kinds of genre and that symbol crash or
9:12
that resonant moment will often pair up
9:14
with the way that you want your reader
9:16
to feel so if you're writing something
9:18
that's a suspense genre you want those
9:21
symbol crash moments to feel suspenseful
9:24
if you're writing a romance then you
9:26
want those symbol crash moments to tie
9:28
into
9:29
the angst or the feeling of romance or
9:32
that feeling of love or loss or aching
9:34
or longing for someone that should be
9:37
the symbol crash of every single scene
9:39
and when you can really get good at
9:41
those symbol crash moments at the end
9:43
that single sentence at the end that
9:45
just makes it all resonate or makes your
9:47
reader long for that next scene
9:51
the better of a writer you're going to
9:52
be and i promise you the more books you
9:55
will sell my readers in particular love
9:57
to call this my dun dun dun moment
9:59
because that is the type of genre that i
10:01
write i write young adult mostly young
10:03
adult fantasy or contemporary fantasy
10:05
and they all have mysteries and suspense
10:07
and twists and turns and so at the end
10:09
of every chapter or the end of every
10:11
scene there's that last little dun dun
10:14
dun moment and in fact when i'm doing
10:16
live readings and things with my fans
10:18
they will all in the chat you can see
10:20
them talking to each other about oh that
10:22
was
10:22
done moment and they know that's going
10:24
to be the end of the reading for the day
10:26
because it leaves you wanting more and
10:28
the more you can do that for your
10:29
readers is
10:31
the more you can build excitement really
10:33
entertain them and so i highly recommend
10:35
mastering the dun dun dun simple crush
10:37
kind of moment so now that we've gone
10:39
over the idea of the beginning middle
10:41
end and the little extra dun dun dun i
Example The Witchs Key
10:44
thought that i would share with you a
10:45
example from my book the witch's key so
10:48
in this book you have a teenage heroine
10:51
named lenora that we call lenny who has
10:54
recently lost her parents to
10:56
a demon so their demon hunting family
10:59
she's grown up in this magical family
11:00
her whole life and now that her parents
11:02
are gone she's had to come and live with
11:04
her uncle martin he's this strange
11:06
mysterious older man that she doesn't
11:08
know anything about and she spent the
11:10
summer basically being a recluse and a
11:12
hermit and now towards the beginning of
11:14
the book she is having to go to high
11:16
school
11:17
for the first time and her goal in the
11:19
scene becomes obvious right from the
11:21
start so
11:23
from these first couple sentences
11:26
she says 20 minutes later as i stood in
11:28
front of the doors to newcastle high i
11:30
felt nearly invisible just like i wanted
11:33
so lenny's goal to be invisible and not
11:36
stand out on her first day of school the
11:38
stakes for her we understand because of
11:41
what's come before the stakes at this
11:43
point are completely emotional for her
11:45
in the first few chapters we learned
11:47
just how hard of a time lenny has had it
11:49
since her parents death and how much
11:51
she's hoping to just blend in she's
11:53
never been to a normal school before she
11:55
doesn't want to drive you know grab any
11:57
attention she just wants to blend in and
11:59
survive and so she doesn't want to deal
12:02
with any of the type of magical things
12:04
or magical creatures that got her
12:06
parents killed she just wants to be like
12:08
normal and invisible so as we move into
12:12
the middle or action of the scene the
12:14
conflict starts to appear
12:16
everyone who walked up smiled and
12:18
greeted friends they'd probably had
12:20
since preschool but no one seemed to
12:22
notice me at all my spell had worked
12:25
i'd used just enough amaranth to help me
12:27
blend in but not enough to make me
12:29
completely invisible hopefully this
12:32
would make high school a lot more
12:33
tolerable
12:34
i would show up do whatever i needed to
12:36
do to survive it keep my head down and
12:38
that would be that it was just one year
12:41
after all
12:42
i took a deep breath and told my feet to
12:44
start walking but i couldn't seem to
12:45
force them forward literally every
12:48
single muscle in my body was rebelling
12:50
against the idea of high school
12:52
it's not as bad as it looks a bubbly
12:55
voice said out of nowhere
12:57
at first i assumed she was talking to
12:59
someone else but then this small
13:01
energetic girl was suddenly there
13:03
smiling up at me like we were old
13:05
friends
13:07
okay so here's where the conflict starts
13:09
her spell worked so we know she's a
13:11
witch that was stuff that came before
13:13
that now leads into the scene but this
13:15
girl notices her right away
13:18
did she see through the magic and if so
13:20
does that mean that she's some kind of
13:22
paranormal being and that is just gonna
13:25
ruin lenny's day because she doesn't
13:26
want any paranormal anything here so as
13:29
the scene progresses the conflict
13:31
increases and we learn a piece of
13:33
information that hints at the larger
13:35
conflict of the entire novel so this
13:37
becomes a stepping stone here
13:39
we all have to stick together right now
13:41
with everything that's going on she said
13:43
her eyes looking downward
13:45
what's going on i asked
13:47
it's just terrible isn't it she asked
13:49
all the joy drained from her voice
13:52
i can't even bring myself to talk about
13:54
those girls nothing like that has ever
13:56
happened in newcastle before no one
13:58
really knows how to deal with it
14:01
so lenny learns here that not only is
14:03
she not invisible like she hoped there's
14:06
potentially magical people here in
14:08
newcastle and there are girls who are
14:10
missing
14:11
and probably dead potentially dead so
14:14
this is the kind of mystery her parents
14:16
used to look into all the time so now
14:18
it's worst case scenario for her she
14:20
comes to this high school hoping that
14:21
she's going to be invisible and what
14:22
happens not only is there some girl here
14:25
that she can't quite figure out that
14:27
sees through her invisibility kind of
14:29
glamour but also she learns that there
14:31
are mysteriously these girls missing and
14:34
she's probably going to be pulled into
14:36
the same kind of mystery that her
14:37
parents got killed
14:39
trying to look after so this is no good
14:41
she wants no part of it so then as that
14:44
scene progresses between her and this
14:46
new girl peyton this is what leads us
14:48
into the end of the scene where she
14:50
realizes that her dream or desire or
14:52
goal of just blending in and avoiding
14:54
any kind of magical life in this town is
14:57
completely hopeless
14:59
i started to put in my combination but
15:01
before i was finished a chill ran down
15:03
my back that was so strong my entire
15:06
body shivered
15:07
i stopped breathing for a moment my hand
15:09
stopping completely as i focused on that
15:11
feeling
15:12
it was the last thing i had expected to
15:15
feel here today in a town like this
15:17
martin had said everyone in this town
15:19
was human normal
15:21
mostly he said they were mostly human
15:25
do you need help peyton asked here i can
15:27
show you how to do it i remember the
15:29
first time i
15:31
i tuned her voice out for a moment and
15:32
slowly turned around searching every
15:34
single face in the hallway
15:36
my heart raced and i hardly allowed
15:38
myself to take a breath as i scanned the
15:40
room
15:41
that feeling had come from someone here
15:44
someone close
15:46
and then suddenly
15:47
there he was
15:49
he was tall
15:50
over six feet if i had to guess
15:52
his dark hair was just long enough to
15:54
fall across his forehead but not so long
15:57
that it covered his dark serious eyes
16:00
his tanned skin practically glowed with
16:02
the health of immortality even under
16:04
these crappy fluorescent lights
16:06
he was strong too judging by the muscles
16:09
that strained against the sleeves of his
16:10
gray t-shirt but most importantly
16:13
there was a certain energy about him
16:15
that i'd come to recognize over the
16:17
years as
16:18
other
16:19
this guy
16:20
whoever he was was not human
16:24
and he was staring straight at me
16:27
do you hear that symbol crash moment at
16:29
the end of that scene i could have just
16:31
ended it with her saying this guy
16:33
whoever he was was not human and that
16:36
would have been
16:37
a good outcome disaster for her oh my
16:40
gosh there's a guy here he's you know
16:42
he's obviously not human all my plans
16:44
and goals are out the door
16:46
but
16:47
intuitively i knew i wanted to add that
16:49
symbol crash zinger at the moment
16:52
and he was staring straight at me that
16:55
boom hits you a little bit harder in the
16:57
heart it makes you go oh my gosh not
16:59
only is he not human but he knows that
17:01
she
17:02
is something other too which makes
17:04
things even worse for liddy because
17:06
there's no way she's going to avoid
17:09
being dragged into all of this if he
17:11
knows who she is definitely a disastrous
17:14
outcome for a girl whose goal was just
17:15
simply to be invisible and to get
17:18
through the school year so on day one
17:20
goal destroyed and of course then the
17:22
thing is
17:24
what's next so you've got your beginning
17:26
your middle your end your symbol crash
17:28
or zinger at the end of that scene and
17:30
then the reader turns the page and what
17:33
happens next so we're going to talk
17:35
about this for a minute when we get to
17:37
the end of a scene there's often another
17:39
piece to it that is a moment of
17:42
resonance a moment of reflection a
17:44
moment of recalibration and this is what
17:47
jack bickham in his book scene and
17:49
structure calls a sequel so scene and
Scene and Sequel
17:52
sequel this is something that km weiland
17:54
also talks about in structuring your
17:55
novel so again those two books would be
17:58
at the top of my list to definitely pick
18:00
up so
18:01
a sequel is kind of a beat after the
18:03
main action of a scene where your
18:06
character has sometimes a moment of
18:08
introspection or a moment of oh my gosh
18:11
where they're processing what just
18:13
happened in the main scene so if you've
18:15
got some kind of big conflict it can
18:17
often be really nice to have that
18:19
emotional
18:20
internal beat for your character and for
18:22
your reader in terms of pacing where
18:25
your character
18:26
processes what's just happened
18:28
kind of tries to figure out where that
18:30
leaves them now
18:32
and what are they going to do next and
18:34
so when it comes to beginning middle and
18:36
end this is kind of like a reaction
18:38
scene a recalibration an emotional beat
18:41
a moment in between scenes where your
18:44
character takes a second to figure out
18:46
what they're gonna do next and this
18:48
sometimes can be just literally just a
18:50
sentence or two or sometimes it can be
18:52
an entire chapter or scene so i find
18:56
that i don't always have a sequel and
18:59
this is something i've been really kind
19:01
of thinking about in my own writing now
19:02
in a book like the witches key where i
Pacing
19:04
have a single point of view i have more
19:07
sequel type moments because we're in
19:10
lenny's point of view the entire book
19:11
and so for pacing we need some of those
19:14
moments of reflection and recalibration
19:17
more so than other types of multi-pov
19:20
books
19:21
with my shadow demon saga later books
19:24
and my eternal sorrows series i have
19:27
five or more points of view characters
19:29
in that book and so often i find that i
19:32
will leave one character with a done
19:34
kind of moment and then i'll move to
19:36
a calmer moment for another character
19:39
and that kind of works as a sequel even
19:41
though it's not happening with the same
19:43
characters this is something with pov i
19:45
would love if you guys would be
19:46
interested in hearing or getting another
19:48
series of videos about writing multiple
19:50
pov i would love to talk about the way
19:52
that sometimes the scene for me is split
19:54
in half
19:55
and how i tend to structure that and
19:57
most of that for me has been intuitive
The Moment
19:59
so it would be kind of interesting to
20:01
pull that apart and talk about it more
20:02
but i will say that in terms of pacing
20:05
and figuring out what happens next it
20:07
can be really exhausting for a reader to
20:10
just get nothing but action and conflict
20:12
action and conflict action and conflict
20:14
they need a moment and your character
20:16
needs a moment for their own development
20:19
if your character never takes a step
20:20
back and says whoa that wasn't at all
20:22
what i thought it was going to be what
20:24
am i going to do next who do i need to
20:25
become we're sometimes going to miss out
20:28
on a lot of that character's development
20:30
in terms of their internal journey plus
20:33
sometimes in order for that next big
20:36
step to be taken and us to understand
20:38
why they're taking that step we need
20:40
just that small beat of your character
20:42
processing what just happened and then
20:45
deciding that they're gonna go do this
20:47
other thing because of it and so it's
20:48
sort of a bridge the sequel can be a
20:50
bridge between action scenes or
20:53
deciding what your next goal is as a
20:55
character so now that you're aware that
20:58
this scene and sequel thing can happen
21:00
you have a beginning middle and end of a
21:02
scene and then you have the sequel
21:03
moment which i'll talk about individual
21:06
structure for that in just a second
21:08
i encourage you to start watching tv
21:10
series reading books thinking of it in
21:12
terms of the scene and sequel when you
21:14
watch movies and things because it can
21:16
be the kind of moment where it's like
21:17
the villain just came in and threatened
21:19
your character who's chained up and when
21:21
he leaves your character has this moment
21:23
of wow that was a new clue how can i use
21:26
this to get free or it's the kind of
21:29
moment where your character has this
Sequel
21:31
run-in with a guy in the hallway at team
21:33
you know teen high school or whatever
21:35
and they rush into the bathroom to
21:37
splash their face with water and they
21:38
sit and think about what just happened
21:40
to them and how they're reacting maybe
21:42
their hands are shaking and they're
21:44
having some kind of reaction to it that
21:46
is a sequel and it is a type of scene in
21:49
a way but it's really kind of a bridge
21:51
between scenes and the more you start to
21:53
see it the more you understand how they
21:55
function in stories it's also really fun
21:57
to see how really good writers keep the
22:00
tension up during these kind of
22:02
emotional sequel beats because what i
22:04
have found in my observations is that a
22:07
lot of times writers will make it a very
22:09
internal type of thing that they'll
22:12
really hone in on your character's fear
22:14
or worry or their understanding that
22:16
they need to change but knowing that
22:18
they're having a hard time with it
22:19
that's often where the tension comes in
22:21
or the dread of oh my gosh my character
22:24
has no idea how to deal with this
22:26
conflict and they're about to make
22:28
another decision that is just going to
22:30
be terrible and that tension starts to
22:32
ratchet up as your character goes to
22:34
take that next step so that's kind of
22:35
fun to pay attention to as well so i'm
22:38
not going to go into this more too much
22:40
more today but i did want to mention it
22:42
i also wanted to mention that in terms
22:44
of the structure of a sequel you can get
22:47
more information from those two books
22:49
that i mentioned but when you talk about
22:51
the beginning middle and end of a scene
22:54
you're often talking about goal conflict
22:57
outcome or goal conflict disaster so
23:00
then the structure she says of a sequel
23:02
is often
23:03
reaction dilemma decision meaning your
23:06
character reacts to whatever just
23:08
happened they process whatever the new
23:10
dilemma is because of the conflict and
23:12
then they make a decision about what to
23:14
do next so again highly recommend
23:16
picking up structuring your novel has
Scene Cards
23:18
changed my life scene and structure by
23:20
jack bickham go grab those books
23:23
okay now that you understand the
23:25
structure of a scene it should be able
23:27
to help you i hope put together your
23:30
scene cards so over in your workbook
23:33
that i made for you guys on writing
23:35
great scenes that again you can grab
23:36
when you sign up for my newsletter list
23:38
i will leave a link for you down below
23:41
there is an example of a scene card so
23:44
on the scene card i kind of share with
23:45
you what i typically will put on my
23:48
index cards when i'm plotting out what
23:51
happens next to my story so i'll do a
23:53
scene overview which can be a brief
23:55
description of the action of this scene
23:57
so for that scene in the witch's key i
23:59
would write and as an overview like
24:01
lenny arrives to her first day of school
24:03
after casting a mild invisibility spell
24:07
so next i'm going to list my pov
24:09
character what their goal is and what's
24:11
at stake for them now if you only have
24:13
one point of view character in the whole
24:15
novel you don't need to put it because
24:16
you know whose character is talking but
24:19
if you have like romance where you're
24:21
writing dual pov or you have multiple
24:23
point of view characters it's good to
24:24
put that on the scene card so you know
24:25
whose eyes you're telling the story
24:27
through so in my example from the
24:29
witch's key i would write something here
24:31
like
24:32
lenny's goal is to blend in and not
24:35
stand out on her first day of school and
24:37
the stakes are that in emotional stakes
24:39
where she'll be pulled in so i would
24:42
physically write lenny hopes no one will
24:43
notice her and she won't have to deal
24:45
with any magic or danger like she did
24:46
when she was living with her parents so
24:49
that ties into her emotional stakes
24:51
right this simple sentence tells me how
24:53
this scene is building on the previous
24:55
scene and it's telling me what her goals
24:58
are and why it's so important to her
25:00
that she blends in then underneath that
25:03
i will often list the conflict of the
25:05
scene so in this particular example i
25:08
would have put peyton notices lenny
25:10
anyway and won't stop talking to her
25:11
which leads to her dropping some
25:13
information about the mysterious
25:14
disappearance of some local girls this
25:17
makes lenny scared because she's
25:18
becoming aware that there might be more
25:20
to this town than she originally thought
25:23
so that gives me a pretty good idea of
25:25
what the conflict is the meat of what's
25:27
going to be happening in the scene she's
25:28
going to be talking to peyton in the
25:30
course of conversation she's going to
25:32
find out about these missing girls
25:34
then at the bottom of the scene card i
25:36
just like to state the outcome so of
25:38
course this is as km weiland calls it
25:40
the disaster
25:42
for this scene i would have written just
25:44
as she's beginning to realize she won't
25:45
be free of her old dangerous life she
25:47
senses someone's magic nearby when she
25:50
turns she sees him tall dark mysterious
25:52
and he definitely sees her too
25:55
so this i might put a little bit more
25:57
short form
25:59
when i put it actually on my plotting
26:01
chart inside my happy planner notebook
26:03
if you've never seen that before or when
26:05
i put it on my plotting wall if you've
26:06
never seen that before i will put some
26:08
plotting videos down below i'm super
26:10
visual so sometimes when i'm plotting i
26:12
will write these up on the board i'll
26:14
put them in my planner and i will have
26:15
them more long form on my post-it notes
26:18
on a post-it note here i probably would
26:20
just say
26:22
lenny shows up at her first date of
26:24
school peyton tells her about the
26:25
missing girls that would probably be the
26:28
main things that i would put maybe i
26:29
would also say at the end kai sees her
26:31
and i would write it as short form as i
26:33
can on a little sticky note when i'm
26:35
putting it on a page flag in my actual
26:38
planner it's so tiny it would just say
26:40
lenny's first day of school and i would
26:42
know from my other notes what happens
26:44
during that so if you guys want a more
26:46
detailed video in the future as to how i
26:49
actually fill out those plotting walls
26:51
the plotting chart in the planner and my
26:53
index card and how they differ from each
26:55
other and why i do all three of those
26:57
which again none of this stuff is
26:59
necessary this is just my process and i
27:02
share it not to tell you that i think
27:03
you should do it this way but just
27:05
because it's worked for me so you never
27:07
know what might click for you as well
27:09
but if you can clearly write out
27:13
what is your character's goal
27:14
what's the obstacle standing in their
27:16
way and what is the disaster or outcome
27:19
to that obstacle that's going to lead
27:21
them into something new or is going to
27:23
present a problem for them that they're
27:25
going to have to make a new decision or
27:27
a new plan
27:28
you basically have an entire outline of
27:30
your scene
27:31
so i hope this has been super helpful
27:33
for you i know this was a nice long
27:35
beefy video but i hope that it was fun
27:38
for you to kind of hear that example and
27:39
hear me walk through it i think it would
27:41
also be fun in the future to maybe fill
27:44
out those scene cards and share with you
27:46
like multiple scene cards but definitely
27:49
in part five we're going to talk about
27:51
how one scene leads into the into the
27:53
next and how you pair those and continue
27:56
stacking them together to create really
27:57
good pacing in your story in terms of
27:59
each individual scene playing into the
28:01
next one so i hope that you will join me
28:04

28:07

bye

hey everybody welcome back to heart
0:02
breathings today is going to be video
0:05
number three of our writing great scenes
0:07
series so last week we talked about the
0:10
importance of having a character who has
0:13
a clear goal or desire in your scene and
0:16
we're going to build on that today by
0:18
talking about what i think is the single
0:20
most important part of writing engaging
0:22
scenes and that is conflict so i've got
0:26
a great video for you today let's get
0:28
started
0:30
[Music]
0:34
so just as a quick reminder i do have a
0:36
free workbook for you if you haven't
0:38
downloaded that yet you can sign up for
0:39
my mailing list down on the description
0:41
box below i'll have a link for you or if
0:43
you're on my newsletter list you should
0:45
have received a link to this in the hb
0:48
resource library to grab it and
0:49
hopefully it'll help you in writing your
0:51
own scenes so let's get started conflict
0:55
is basically an obstacle to your
0:58
character's goal so your character has a
1:00
clear goal or desire some place they're
1:02
trying to go someone they're trying to
1:04
talk to information they're trying to
1:06
get and all those good things that we
1:07
talked about in last week's video which
1:10
by the way i'll have that playlist
1:11
linked for you down below in case you
1:13
missed it
1:14
conflict comes in when we talk about the
1:17
obstacle or whatever is standing in your
1:19
character's way of getting or achieving
1:22
that goal that they want to achieve so
1:24
let's say your character is trying to
1:26
escape from prison
1:28
if they have their plan and they go into
1:31
the scene and we know that they're
1:32
trying to escape this is the night
1:34
they're gonna do it and
1:36
everything goes according to plan they
1:38
go through the wall they get out of the
1:40
prison and they have someone picking up
1:42
up on the other side and their plan goes
1:44
exactly the way they hoped
1:46
where's the conflict where's the tension
1:48
your reader might be interested in
1:49
seeing someone escape from prison but if
1:52
you really want to have a story
1:55
you've got to put in the conflict that
1:56
is the main job of any writer is to
2:00
throw obstacles in your character's way
2:02
and that is not just on a large scale
2:06
with your entire novel it happens also
2:08
in a mini story level in every single
2:11
one of your scenes your character wants
2:12
something they desire something or they
2:14
have a goal and where the tension in
2:16
your scene comes in is the obstacle
2:19
what's standing in their way what's
2:21
making them fail and sometimes that can
2:23
be something internal and sometimes it
2:25
can be something external so we're going
2:27
to talk about types of conflict we're
2:29
going to talk about some examples we're
2:31
going to talk about layering conflict to
2:32
make it even more intense but conflict
2:35
just for the sake of conflict simply
2:38
isn't enough so throwing in a random
2:40
argument or a random obstacle that
2:42
wasn't set up before or doesn't lead
2:44
into something next like a domino effect
2:48
isn't really great conflict just an
2:50
argument on the page isn't really
2:52
conflict and we're going to talk about
2:54
the difference and i'm going to share
2:55
with you some just random examples about
2:57
that to help you see the difference
2:59
because in order to have truly engaging
3:02
scenes and to have your readers really
3:04
care about what's happening
3:06
that conflict and your character's goal
3:09
needs to be in flow and tied into the
3:12
larger story that we're reading here and
3:15
it all needs to flow together and be
3:17
connected and this is really about
3:19
organic conflict that feels real it
3:22
feels important it feels vital to the
3:24
story not just some random argument
3:26
because you needed conflict in this
3:27
scene and i think that's something that
3:29
is so important especially for newer
3:31
writers to understand so let's talk a
3:33
little bit about the types of conflict
3:34
that you might have in your scene
Types of Conflict
3:36
similar to your character's goal that we
3:38
talked about last week conflict can be
3:41
this huge life or death type of
3:43
situation that stands in your
3:44
character's way or it can be a really
3:47
subtle but tense conversation between
3:49
two characters so it can be something
3:51
big flashy
3:53
external type of conflict but it also
3:55
can just be something very quiet that's
3:57
happening inside your character this
3:59
internal conflict can also create great
4:01
tension so there's really a scale and
4:03
there's just infinite amount of
4:05
possibilities there are several
4:07
resources and posts and books out there
4:09
that will tell you technically the types
4:11
of conflict like character versus
4:13
themselves as an internal character type
4:16
conflict or character versus the world
4:19
character versus character character
4:21
versus organization character versus
4:23
society character versus technology
4:26
character versus disease so really what
4:29
it comes down to i will link some of
4:30
those blog posts below if you want to
4:32
read a little bit more about these but
4:34
really what it comes down to is conflict
4:36
is really anything that is standing in
4:38
your character's way so character versus
4:40
literally anything including himself
4:42
so all of those types of conflict are
4:44
valid but what really gets a lot of
4:46
readers mixed up is how that conflict
4:49
ties into the rest of your story and
4:52
whether it feels vital to your story and
4:54
it feels organic so this is really what
4:57
i'm going to be focused on in today's
4:58
video because i think it's the most
5:00
important sort of
5:02
piece that needs to come into play when
5:03
it comes to your conflict when i talk
5:05
about organic conflict i'm talking about
5:08
conflict that feels real that comes up
5:11
naturally because of your character's
5:12
personality or their situation in life
5:15
because of the relationships that you've
5:17
already set up because of their job
5:20
because of something going on in their
5:21
world it feels like a natural
5:24
progression because it feels like it's
5:25
vital and it's connected to the rest of
5:27
the story
5:28
organic conflict is also something that
5:31
like i said has been set up earlier in
5:33
the story so you know that this
5:35
character has tension with her sister or
5:37
you know this character has issues with
5:39
abandonment so now when we put her in a
5:41
situation where she feels abandoned
5:43
she's got this great internal conflict
5:45
so you can set it up earlier in the
5:47
story you can set it up organically in
5:49
your character's backstory or in their
5:50
personality or it can be something that
5:53
is an actual obstacle that's happening
5:55
to your character that then plays into
5:58
whatever happens next so they're trying
5:59
to escape from prison and a prison guard
6:02
stops them now what is the consequence
6:05
of that so that's kind of the next part
6:06
of it is you've got the conflict that
6:08
has something to do organically with the
6:10
story and then there are stakes there
6:12
are consequences to whatever that
6:14
obstacle was or to your character
6:16
failing at whatever their goal was now
6:19
they've been caught so they're being
6:20
thrown in solitary confinement or
6:22
they've been caught and now they have to
6:24
do dirty work for this guard who's going
6:25
to be blackmailing them there's going to
6:27
be some type of consequence and that is
6:29
so much more interesting than a prisoner
6:32
who just
6:33
everything goes according to plan and
6:34
they're out right so we want to build in
6:36
that organic conflict so in this way
6:39
start thinking about the themes of your
6:41
story both for your character arc and
6:43
for the story overall in terms of the
6:45
action or the events of your story for
6:47
example if you know that part of your
6:50
character's arc and their growth and
6:51
transformation in this particular book
6:54
is going to revolve around trust then
6:57
you're gonna want to put in scene level
6:59
conflict that forces your character to
7:02
come to terms with trust so they might
7:05
have someone betray them which then sets
7:06
them back or they might be forced to
7:09
trust someone in order to save their own
7:10
lives but you're gonna want to build in
7:12
that conflict that plays against their
7:14
theme or what the growth they need to
7:16
face in a similar way if you have a
7:19
romance where you have a hero who is
7:22
scared to love again after great loss
7:24
then you want to start brainstorming
7:27
conflicts that are going to come up
7:29
throughout their story on a scene level
7:31
that are going to have them coming face
7:33
to face with this fear of loving again
7:36
after they've lost someone so you're
7:38
going to use those overarching themes
7:40
and the more that you can weave in
7:43
all of that high level eagle eye level
7:45
stuff from character arc and plot onto a
7:48
mini miniature scene level and really
7:50
weave it together the stronger your
7:52
conflict is going to be throughout the
7:53
entire book part of why this works is
7:55
that organic conflict feels real it
7:58
feels logical to the reader the reader
8:00
you're asking them to follow you through
8:03
this 90 000 word book for hours to
8:05
follow your story and if it feels like a
8:07
bunch of just random disconnected scenes
8:10
it's not going to be a very compelling
8:12
story or if there's just conflict that
8:13
never comes back around it's not going
8:16
to flow correctly but when you write
8:18
conflict into every scene that stems
8:21
from what's come before or affects
8:23
what's coming next it feels vital to the
8:25
story and this is so important to
8:27
writing engaging scenes okay so we're
Example 1
8:30
going to talk a little bit about a
8:32
possible example that i just sort of
8:33
made up for the purposes of
8:35
demonstration so let's say you're
8:38
writing a romance novel and you are in
8:40
one of the early scenes and the conflict
8:44
for the scene is going to be an argument
8:46
between your heroine and her roommate
8:48
and so we're going to basically ask what
8:51
is my character's goal in this scene and
8:53
why does this conflict what's the
8:55
obstacle and why does this conflict
8:57
matter in the grand scheme of the story
8:59
so let's say our heroine's goal in the
9:01
scene is to talk with her roommate about
9:04
paying the rent because her roommate is
9:06
a month late on rent or she's been late
9:08
for several months in a row so her goal
9:10
is to get this check from her
9:12
the conflict is that the roommate
9:14
doesn't have the money and keeps
9:15
stalling so in and of itself this
9:18
conflict might be mostly good it's an
9:21
argument it's about money that could add
9:23
some tension right but
9:25
it's really going to be about what's
9:28
actually happening in the scene both on
9:29
an internal level with your character
9:32
and on an external level and how this
9:34
scene's conflict plays into what's
9:35
coming next so in example one let's say
9:39
that your heroine gets an argument with
9:41
her roommate who won't pay her rent
9:44
and then she just leaves to go on a date
9:47
let's say our heroine doesn't have any
9:49
pressing reason why she has to have the
9:50
money she has plenty of money in the
9:52
bank and we're never going to mention
9:54
rent and money again and the whole
9:55
purpose of that scene was basically just
9:57
to have a conflict between her roommate
9:59
to show that she doesn't like where
10:01
she's living
10:03
like not the best conflict because
10:05
there's nothing at stake here she can
10:07
afford to pay the rent there's really
10:09
you know it's just showing us a very
10:10
weak kind of conflict between her and
10:12
her roommate
10:14
but something that you could do
10:16
to just to show you the difference
10:18
between that type of conflict and the
10:20
type of conflict that's really strong
10:22
organic conflict let's say that we
10:25
already know that our heroin grew up in
10:28
an unstable household where her mother
10:30
never paid rent and they had to move
10:32
from house to house and that has really
10:34
affected our heroin to the point where
10:36
she feels an obsessive need to control
10:39
everything in her life she's never late
10:40
she's never late with rent like she has
10:42
to have it all paid and now she's got
10:44
this roommate whose rent she can't cover
10:46
for more than a month or two who won't
10:48
pay her share so they might get kicked
10:50
out of their apartment now we've got
10:52
stakes and we've got
10:54
actual consequences that might come out
10:56
of this rent not being able to pay be
10:58
paid and we've got a tie-in to our
11:00
heroine's internal arc too because we
11:02
know that she's legitimately panicking
11:05
over not being able to pay this rent
11:07
there are other ways that we can
11:09
actually make this even stronger so
11:11
let's say for example we wanted to layer
11:14
in conflict so if you could have
11:16
multiple layers of conflict going on at
11:18
the same time you can just increase that
11:20
tension so we know our heroin hates to
11:22
be late so let's say while this argument
11:24
is going on her phone is also going off
11:26
constantly because her mr perfect
11:29
totally stable
11:30
exactly predictable boyfriend that she
11:33
very much wants to lock down into an
11:35
engagement is downstairs currently with
11:38
his car and he's upset that she's late
11:40
for their date but she knows that she
11:42
can't leave until she gets this rent
11:43
payment so now we've got multiple layers
11:45
of conflict she's trying to have this
11:47
argument not getting her way her
11:49
boyfriend's upset everything seems to be
11:51
going wrong
11:53
still with that if she just got the rent
11:55
check and walked out it's not going to
11:58
be as much of good conflict if we have
12:00
some consequences come up so let's say
12:03
the rent just isn't going to get paid
12:06
our heroine is late and ends up going
12:08
out with her boyfriend and finding out
12:10
that he's been cheating on her or he's
12:12
breaking up with her and now we've got
12:15
multiple tension
12:16
going on because she's her it's gonna
12:18
feel like her whole life is falling
12:20
apart that where she was trying to
12:21
control everything just so and now it's
12:23
falling apart and then as that ties in
12:26
what if because she broke up with this
12:28
guy
12:29
she's then so sad that she oversleeps
12:32
and she's late for work the next day and
12:34
they had a really important appointment
12:36
and she loses her job now this argument
12:39
with her roommate about the rent becomes
12:42
this much more important in the next
12:44
scene because she already doesn't have
12:46
the money now she just lost her job so
12:49
let's say at this point this is where we
12:51
enter our fun-loving hero who is not mr
12:55
stable he's a travel loving vagabond
12:58
kind of guy and now he's going to
13:01
challenge our heroine who is this
13:03
straight-laced uptight gotta control
13:05
everything kind of person so as you can
13:07
see in that first example
13:09
if we don't tie
13:12
that argument in with who our heroine is
13:14
and her personality what her backstory
13:16
is and we end up getting a rent check
13:19
and everything goes her way it's not a
13:21
very interesting story however just
13:23
changing a few details like giving our
13:25
heroine this backstory we're not having
13:28
that money or that stability really
13:30
matters to who she is and adds to her
13:32
own
13:33
panic and tension and then that causes a
13:35
domino effect where she loses her
13:37
boyfriend she loses her job and now
13:38
she's in real trouble that amplifies the
13:41
tension to 100 degrees so hopefully you
13:44
can see in that example what it means to
13:47
really add in organic conflict that ties
13:50
into your character's personality or
13:52
situation or struggle in some way so
Intensity in Conflict
13:54
let's talk a little bit about intensity
13:56
in a scene because intensity can matter
13:59
too you want a variety of intensities
14:02
throughout your novel some scenes maybe
14:04
just have small but emotional conflict
14:07
while other scenes are going to have my
14:09
whole life is falling apart this is the
14:11
moment that's going to determine
14:12
everything that happens or whether i
14:14
live or die that kind of intense
14:16
conflict and we're going to have a mix
14:18
and that's going to play into your
14:19
pacing which we'll talk about in a
14:20
future video part of what adds to the
14:23
intensity though is what's at stake for
14:25
your character so in that first example
14:28
if your character has plenty of money in
14:29
the bank and doesn't really matter if a
14:31
roommate pays rent or not we don't have
14:34
high intensity because there's really
14:36
nothing at stake for our character
14:37
however if we have a character who is on
14:40
her last dime and she cannot stomach the
14:43
idea of losing this apartment or being
14:45
late on rent and she doesn't have the
14:47
money to cover it we've got a lot more
14:49
intense type of conflict going on here
14:51
we could actually
14:53
ramp up the intensity of that conflict
14:55
if we said her roommate isn't just a
14:57
friend her roommate is her sister who
15:00
she is always
15:02
like being just like their mother and
15:05
expecting for our heroine to come in and
15:07
save her that ramps up the intensity
15:09
because it adds another personal
15:11
conflict to the mix if you added another
15:14
layer of conflict by where you said she
15:16
needs this money because she's got a dog
15:18
that has cancer and needs her meds or
15:20
something like that we start adding even
15:22
more intensity to it so when we're
15:25
talking about intensity a lot of times
15:26
we're talking about what are the
15:27
consequences here if my heroine or hero
15:30
fails to achieve their goal or whatever
15:33
obstacle comes up how important is that
15:36
and that's really where the intensity
15:37
starts to play into your conflict so one
15:40
of the things i like to ask myself when
15:41
i'm brainstorming different types of
15:43
conflict is how is this obstacle going
15:45
to affect my character on an internal
15:48
level what is it going to do to their
15:50
anxiety their personality their growth
15:51
how is it going to challenge them and
15:53
then also how is this consequence this
15:56
obstacle going to affect them in the
15:58
future will they lose their job will
15:59
they lose their lives like what is going
16:01
to happen here when it comes to that
16:03
example i was giving about the prison
16:05
break if they're caught and now they're
16:08
basically being blackmailed by this head
16:10
jailer who happens to be extremely
16:12
abusive now we've got real intense
16:14
conflict because that
16:16
mistake of not following through with
16:18
their
16:19
jailbreak is going to affect them on a
16:22
really really deep level in terms of
16:24
what happens to them or how much they're
16:26
abused in the future so the stakes just
16:28
continue to rise and that adds a level
16:30
of intensity to your story basically the
16:32
more intense the stakes the more intense
16:35
the impact to your character's life in
16:37
some way the more intense the conflict
16:40
is for that scene so let's look at a
Example 2
16:42
second example just to kind of bring
16:44
this home let's say we have a young
16:46
adult fantasy story where we have a
16:48
heroine who has been caught for stealing
16:51
a loaf of bread and she's being brought
16:53
in this scene to the prince who has the
16:56
power to basically throw her in the
16:57
dungeon or to have her killed so we've
16:59
got high intensity stakes here and we
17:02
have a goal of a heroine to convince the
17:04
prince that she
17:06
didn't mean any harm and convince him to
17:08
let her go without punishment the
17:11
obstacle to that is going to be
17:14
whatever happens with the prince so
17:16
there's multiple ways that we could
17:18
write this but of course if our heroine
17:20
goes in to plead for her life to the
17:23
prince and he believes her and lets her
17:25
go on her merry way and she's able to
17:27
take the loaf of bread to her starving
17:28
sister we don't really have any conflict
17:31
it could feel a little bit intense
17:32
because ooh her life is at stake but if
17:35
there's no real obstacle and we never
17:36
see that prince again we don't really
17:38
have good conflict and we don't have a
17:40
great story but we could shift this
17:43
instead to
17:45
massive conflict she goes in she pleads
17:47
with her life to the prince tries to
17:49
tell him about her sister who would
17:51
starve without this bread but the prince
17:53
who is a very
17:54
stern young man doesn't even listen to
17:57
her and says throw her in the dungeons
18:00
now that's a massive obstacle she did
18:02
not achieve her goal of getting him to
18:04
let her go and instead now she is in
18:06
prison
18:07
and a lot of people die down there and
18:09
in fact her sister who is a really young
18:11
child who relies on her is now not going
18:14
to be able to fend for herself or take
18:16
care of herself now that she is in
18:18
prison so that adds massively more
18:22
conflict to your story and that is also
18:25
going to lead into a domino effect of
18:27
consequences for our character she's now
18:29
in prison basically in a dungeon and
18:31
she's going to have a new
18:33
goal of now i need to get out of this
18:35
dungeon right so this particular scene
18:38
plays into what happens next and next
18:40
and next you could also do something
18:42
like okay maybe the prince allows to let
18:44
her go
18:45
but he tells her that if i ever see you
18:48
steal a loaf of bread again you're dead
18:51
and so that adds a little bit of con
18:53
conflict there and maybe you could add
18:54
conflict with a guard who says i'm going
18:56
to be keeping an eye on you so she gets
18:58
free but the next day she's caught with
19:01
loaf bread and now some other
19:02
consequence happens to her so it's
19:05
really important hopefully you can see
19:06
that when your character just gets what
19:09
they want there's no conflict there's no
19:11
story it's not interesting for anyone
19:13
but if you can tie in and look at your
19:16
character's goal or desire in every
19:18
single scene of your book
19:20
and then place obstacles in their path
19:22
that have real consequences to the story
19:26
and how it's going to unfold or
19:27
consequences to your character's
19:29
internal story arc and transformation
19:32
you've got a winning book on your hands
Final Thoughts on Conflict
19:34
just to leave you with some final
19:35
thoughts conflict is really essential to
19:38
your novel and if you had a character
19:41
that just sailed through the story
19:42
sailed through and achieved all their
19:44
goals and there were no obstacles there
19:46
literally would be no story so we've got
19:48
to have conflict but as i've told you in
19:50
this video i hope i've really explained
19:52
it well but conflict needs to feel real
19:55
and organic so don't be afraid to build
19:58
it into your story give your character
20:00
some flaws that are going to come up
20:02
give them some kind of wound or ghost
20:04
some kind of backstory that's going to
20:06
make them need to grow and transform in
20:08
order to be the hero they need to be for
20:10
this story create relationships for your
20:12
main characters that are nuanced that
20:15
are complex that are you know full of
20:17
tension and backstory or
20:19
that kind of good sort of tension that
20:21
we like to see on the page create
20:24
worst case scenarios huge obstacles to
20:26
your character's plan to the point where
20:28
readers aren't even sure how in the
20:29
world your character is going to survive
20:31
this or get over it or overcome this
20:33
obstacle that is what really truly good
20:36
stories are made of so first we have
20:38
that goal or desire on a scene level and
20:40
then we have some kind of obstacle to it
20:42
that feels organic to the story that's
20:44
going to affect your character or affect
20:46
the story in some big way because of
20:48
what's at stake if your character fails
20:50
and when they fail because of some outer
20:53
obstacle or some inner obstacle that
20:55
leads to the next level of conflict the
20:58
next consequence they have to face and
21:00
the more you can escalate that tension
21:02
and that conflict throughout your entire
21:04
story the more you're going to have a
21:06
novel on your hands that people just do
21:08
not want to put down if you can start
21:10
with tension on the page in that very
21:11
first scene that very first time that
21:13
your character is met and then grow it
21:16
escalate it make it bigger make the
21:18
consequences bigger the stakes bigger
21:20
and grow that conflict on the page in a
21:21
way that feels organic and real and
21:24
vital and natural to the story your
21:26
skill as a writer is just going to
21:28
continue to blossom and grow as you
21:31
learn how to do this i promise you it
21:33
will revolutionize your writing and it
21:36
will help you sell so many more books
21:38
readers are forgiving about a lot of
21:40
things but if they don't care about what
21:42
your character is going through and
21:43
they're not asking questions about how
21:45
in the world are they going to get out
21:46
of this or how in the world are they
21:47
ever going to become the person they
21:49
need to be or how are they ever going to
21:50
find love if you're questioning your
21:51
readers and asking those kind of
21:53
questions then you don't have good
21:55
conflict in your story so let me know in
21:57
the comments what your thoughts are
21:58
about tension and scenes and if you have
22:00

troduction
0:00
hey hearties welcome back to our series
0:02
on writing great scenes today we're
0:04
going to talk about your character's
0:06
goal or desire in a scene and how that
0:09
plays into the overall plot and conflict
0:12
and everything else that goes into
0:13
writing a great scene so let's get
0:15
started
0:16
[Music]
0:20
in all good scenes your main POV
Goal or Desire
0:24
character point of view character is
0:25
going to have some kind of goal or
0:27
desire they'll either be trying to make
0:29
a decision about something they're going
0:31
to be trying to get information from
0:33
someone they might be trying to get from
0:35
one location to another they might be
0:38
trying to obtain something physical
0:39
there's all kinds of like Limitless
0:42
number of goals or desires that your
0:44
character can have it can be something
0:46
emotional it can be something
0:47
interpersonal or it can be something
0:49
concrete like I'm going in here to steal
0:51
this golden statue but every scene will
0:54
have some kind of mini goal that it's
0:56
going to play into the overall story
0:58
structure or your over overall character
1:00
Arc for your story and there needs to be
1:03
some kind of clear consequence or
1:05
something at stake for what happens if
1:07
your character doesn't reach their goal
1:10
or their desire doesn't come true or
1:12
they fail in some way so what's at stake
1:14
for my character if they don't achieve
1:17
their goal this is a good question when
1:19
you're starting to think about each
1:21
individual scene of your novel what is
1:24
at stake for my character what do they
1:25
want and what's at stake and I'm going
1:27
to give you a whole list of questions
1:28
that are also in your workbook for this
1:30
series that you can go through as you're
1:32
trying to brainstorm your scenes and
1:34
what's going to happen in those scenes
1:35
that these questions have really helped
1:37
me a lot in my own writing again if you
1:40
are new to my Channel or new to this
1:42
series this is series two and there's a
1:44
playlist down below there's going to be
1:45
five Total videos in this series and
1:47
there is an accompanying workbook that
1:49
is totally free for you to download if
1:51
you were on my newsletter list it is
1:53
already in the HB resource library and
1:55
if you are not on my list there's a link
1:57
to join down below and you'll get access
1:59
to this this workbook as well as all of
2:01
my other resources so when we're
2:03
plotting our story we're always asking
2:05
ourselves what's our character's Big
2:07
Goal what are they trying to accomplish
2:09
what's the story question and what's at
2:11
stake if they fail and this is happening
2:13
on a big level but it also happens on a
2:16
micro level on a mini story level inside
2:18
every scene of your book so today we're
2:21
diving into character Arc goals and how
2:23
it all comes together to help you write
2:25
better scenes first of all when it comes
The Stakes
2:27
to characters mainly your point of view
2:30
character or characters your main
2:32
characters of the story you need to give
2:34
your reader some reason to care about
2:36
what's happening to that character
2:37
that's the only thing that's going to
2:39
keep them turning the pages really if
2:41
your reader doesn't like your character
2:43
or they don't care about them or they
2:45
don't feel like anything's at stake for
2:46
that character they're probably not
2:48
going to keep reading now I do hope to
2:51
do an entire series on characters at
2:53
some point in the future so we won't go
2:54
too deep into this but for now I'll just
2:57
generalize and say that you you need to
3:00
give your reader reasons to care about
3:02
what's happening in your story world and
3:04
one of the strongest and most effective
3:06
ways to do that is to show what's
3:09
happening in the world Through The Eyes
3:11
of a character who has something big at
3:13
stake so if your main character is just
3:16
an observer and has nothing at stake
3:18
nothing to lose everything goes their
3:20
way then you don't really have an
3:22
engaging story 99 of the time so you
3:26
need a character who's going to be in
3:27
the thick of the action who's really got
3:29
something at stake and of course it
3:31
doesn't have to all be blowing up
3:33
buildings and their lives are at stake
3:35
it could be that their emotional life is
3:37
at stake if I don't let go of the past
3:40
and learn to love again then I will die
3:43
an emotional death right so those it can
3:45
be more subtle than just like big action
3:47
movie type steaks but the stakes need to
3:50
be there and they need to feel real and
3:52
the way we do that is through this a
3:54
series of scenes now in the beginning of
3:57
your book or your series that's where
3:59
you're really going to set the
4:00
foundation of who your character is what
4:03
they care about and what's at stake for
4:05
them so this is where you really share
4:07
your character's flaws you share who
4:09
they are what they care about who they
4:11
care for and what is at stake in their
4:15
world so they may have a daughter that
4:16
they're caring for and if they get taken
4:18
away or if they die that daughter has no
4:21
one but you give them some kind of
4:23
stakes something to lose in this world
4:25
right from the start of your novel your
4:28
reader needs to understand who your
4:30
character is what they care about and
4:33
what's at stake for them and the reader
4:35
needs to know why they care why should
4:37
they care about this character and
4:38
what's going on in their lives it's also
4:40
good to establish in these early scenes
4:42
what does your character need to
4:44
overcome or how are they going to need
4:46
to change to hit the outcome that we all
4:48
hope for them in the end like think of
4:51
the born identity right Jason Bourne I
4:53
haven't actually read the novels but I'm
4:54
going to talk about the movies so in the
4:57
beginning we understand that Jason
4:58
Bourne's life is at stage he's being
5:00
chased he's part of something he doesn't
5:02
understand and we know that he doesn't
5:03
have his memory so right away we
5:06
understand that there's a lot at stake
5:08
for this character he doesn't he's it's
5:10
literally life or death for him but we
5:13
start to get glimpses as the scenes play
5:15
out that this is a part of a larger
5:17
thing that could affect the entire world
5:19
the stakes continue to rise throughout
5:21
the scenes but we understand right from
5:23
the beginning that he's gonna have to
5:25
overcome his memory loss he's going to
5:26
have to overcome his own emotional
5:29
turmoil at not remembering who he was or
5:31
the things that he's done in his past so
5:33
you understand right from those first
5:34
scenes what he has to overcome how he's
5:37
going to have to change and really
5:39
what's at stake for him which is life or
5:41
death everything we come to know about
5:44
our characters of course happens in the
5:46
context of scenes and so similar to the
5:51
way that with my hb90 method I talk
5:53
about how you have an overarching goal
5:55
and we break that down into projects and
5:57
tasks that are bite size the same same
6:00
thing happens with your novel you have
6:02
an overarching character Arc or an
6:04
overarching external goal that your
6:06
character has usually an external goal
6:08
and an internal goal right and then
6:11
you're going to take that overarching
6:13
goal and we're going to break it down
6:14
into a series of scenes where each scene
6:17
advances or escalates your character's
6:20
Arc who they are how they have to change
6:22
each scene changes them in some way
6:25
helps them grow in some way helps them
6:27
see the truth in some way and it happens
6:29
in tiny bite-sized little mini stories
6:31
called scenes so I have a series of I
Six Questions To Ask
6:34
would say six questions that I like to
6:35
ask myself when I'm really thinking
6:37
about a scene and how it pertains to
6:39
characters goal and the conflict that
6:42
they're going to face so the first one
6:43
is of course what is my character's goal
6:47
or desire in the scene what are they
6:49
trying to accomplish what are they
6:50
trying to learn or do what is their goal
6:53
number two why is this scene important
6:55
to my character why do they care why is
6:58
it important to them why is this desire
7:00
something that they care about or
7:02
something they want to find or achieve
7:04
or obtain number three what happens if
7:07
they fail what's at stake for my
7:08
character not just in the overarching
7:10
storyline but in this individual scene
7:12
if they don't get the information they
7:14
were looking for what's at stake if they
7:16
don't convince this person if they don't
7:18
find the amulet what's at stake for them
7:20
if this particular small piece of the
7:23
story doesn't go their way number four
7:25
what obstacle are they going to face in
7:27
this scene so of course the obstacle is
7:29
the conflict and we're going to have a
7:30
whole video about this in episode 3 of
7:33
this series but just for answering for
7:35
character's sake What conflict are they
7:37
going to come across what's going to be
7:39
the obstacle that's going to keep them
7:41
from achieving their desire or their
7:43
goal in this scene number five what are
7:46
we going to learn about our character so
7:48
what it can be what are we going to
7:49
learn about them or how do they change
7:51
or transform within the context of this
7:55
particular scene and facing this
7:56
particular conflict so sometimes when
7:58
your character has a a goal and they
8:00
know why they want it and they know what
8:02
happens if they don't get it some kind
8:03
of conflict comes in and arises that's
8:06
an obstacle to their goal and they learn
8:08
something new about themselves or they
8:10
understand that they have to change
8:12
their tactics in some way or they have
8:14
to actually change and transform
8:15
themselves in some way so what is that
8:17
element here and number six how does
8:20
this particular scene fit into my
8:23
character's overall Journey so is this
8:25
their argument against transformation is
8:27
this the moment where they realize that
8:30
all hope is lost like where does this
8:32
play into their character Arc and how do
8:35
how what are we learning about them in
8:37
this what part of their Journey are we
8:38
seeing in this scene so to give this a
Example: The Bourne Identity
8:41
little bit more context and to share
8:42
with you kind of what I mean by these
8:44
questions and why they're important I'm
8:46
going to take one of my favorite scenes
8:48
from an action flick so we'll talk again
8:50
about the Bourne Identity which
8:52
hopefully you've all seen before but if
8:55
not I will put a link below to this
8:57
particular scene that I think a lot of
8:59
people call the like French apartment
9:00
scene it's one of the first like really
9:02
good action sequences in this particular
9:06
movie and again I'm sorry I haven't read
9:08
the books I probably should go read them
9:09
but we'll just talk about the film for
9:11
now because it's easy to just watch that
9:13
quick little clip but basically Jason
9:15
Bourne has lost his memory he has
9:18
amnesia but he knows that there's you
9:22
know someone after him he knows his life
9:24
is in danger and he's got to figure
9:25
things out quick so to go through these
9:28
six questions real quick for that French
9:30
apartment scene was my character's goal
9:32
or desire well his goal is to go back to
9:35
the old apartment where he used to live
9:37
and to scope it out for Clues can he
9:40
remember any piece of who he used to be
9:42
are there any clues there about what
9:44
happened to him so he wants to find out
9:47
information by going to this apartment
9:50
number two why is this scene important
9:52
to Jason Bourne why is this action
9:53
important well obviously he understands
9:56
that he has Amnesia he wants to figure
9:59
out who he was and this is the next
10:01
logical step so this is important this
10:03
is a big clue for him number three
10:05
what's gonna happen if he fails so if he
10:08
doesn't figure out who he is and
10:10
remember who he is then he's not going
10:12
to be able to protect himself and he's
10:14
not going to be able to fight back
10:15
against whoever it is that's after him
10:18
he needs information and really it's
10:20
life or death Stakes for him number four
10:23
what obstacle will he face in this scene
10:25
so if you've seen this he's very quietly
10:29
kind of walking through he's with the
10:30
girl named Marie that he's just met and
10:33
she's like what's what's going on but he
10:36
has these instincts he doesn't even
10:38
understand because of his Amnesia and he
10:40
knows something's up right and then we
10:42
have this guy like come through the
10:44
window shooting them up and stuff like
10:46
that so it's a really big action scene
10:47
so that's obviously the obstacle is as
10:50
he's trying to find this information
10:52
somebody comes in with a gun and tries
10:54
to kill him that is definitely good
10:56
conflict so number five what are we
10:58
going to learn about our character in
10:59
the scene and what changes about them
11:02
after this scene so we learned first of
11:05
all that Jason Bourne
11:07
has these internal instincts so he
11:10
doesn't hesitate he immediately goes
11:12
after this guy he doesn't pause he
11:15
doesn't get scared he just is a machine
11:17
and he just goes through boom boom boom
11:19
boom boom the way that no like normal
11:22
person would do so we see very clearly
11:24
what his training is that he's mentally
11:27
like still has those skills it's so good
11:30
but we understand that like there's this
11:32
piece of him he really doesn't
11:33
understand that's just kind of like on
11:35
autopilot that he really was deep into
11:38
whatever this was assassin whatever and
11:41
it UPS the stakes for him because it's
11:43
like he was deep into this and there's
11:45
really starting to understand who he is
11:48
in this scene and so what changes for
11:50
him after this is he understands okay
11:53
this is maybe different than I thought
11:55
it wasn't just some ordinary guy like
11:57
this is a big deal and there's something
12:01
bigger in this than I ever thought so it
12:03
really raises the stakes it it enlarges
12:06
the story world to an extent helps us to
12:08
see kind of who the villain is even
12:10
though we don't know who they are just
12:12
yet so how does this scene fit into my
12:15
character's overall Journey well this is
12:17
the moment where he really sees who he
12:20
was and starts to come to terms with
12:22
exactly who he was and what kind of
12:23
person he used to be and it's just so
12:26
beautifully done with uh Marie the Marie
12:29
character who's really just kind of
12:31
losing it over what just happened which
12:33
is like the normal reaction to it and
12:35
he's just like
12:36
you know all business right so this is
12:41
really uh important scene and I will
12:43
link that for you down below but this is
12:45
one of the things that I like to do and
12:46
not every scene has to have like Shoot
12:48
Em Up kind of action it can just be as
12:50
simple as you have a desire something
12:53
that you're trying to accomplish you're
12:54
trying to tell this woman how you feel
12:56
about her and then the obstacle might be
12:58
that her mother keeps walking in and
13:01
interrupting you and you just never get
13:02
a chance to really tell her and she
13:03
doesn't understand how you feel and so
13:05
that tension is ratcheting up because
13:07
you never got a chance to tell her and
13:09
you're never going to get another chance
13:10
because she's flying to France tomorrow
13:12
so there it doesn't have to be action
13:15
it's it's whatever fits your current
13:17
genre is really what you need to think
13:19
about but those six questions can really
13:21
help you start to narrow in on what's
13:23
happening in each scene because whatever
13:25
happens here like km Weiland says is
13:28
going to be a domino effect so whatever
13:30
he learns in this scene and however he
13:32
changes in this Scene It needs to cause
13:34
something else to happen in the next
13:36
scene so what's his next logical step
13:38
and so we're going to talk in a future
13:40
video about how to begin to sort of
13:42
Stack those scenes together to create
13:44
your plot as a whole basically every
13:46
scene should impact your character's
13:48
overall desire and their overall
13:50
transformation in some way some of them
13:52
small and subtle some of them really big
13:54
life-changing moments and if you can
13:57
really start out by showing your
14:00
character showing your reader who your
14:02
character is and why they should care
14:03
about them you're already on a really
14:06
good path and then if every single scene
14:08
moves that character forward in some way
14:10
to understanding who they are
14:12
understanding why they want what they
14:14
want what's really standing in their way
14:16
and what the stakes are then you're
14:17
going to keep those readers turning
14:19
Pages late into the night now one more
14:21
note about characters and character Arc
Choosing POV Character
14:23
here is that one popular like structure
14:25
of putting scenes together is to pair
14:27
them in something called scene and SQL
14:30
so km Weiland talks about this a lot but
14:32
where I first learned this was in the
14:34
book scene and structure by Jack Beckham
14:37
so this idea is that fiction is made up
14:40
of cause and effect stimulus and
14:42
response so you'll I highly recommend
14:45
that you pick up this book because he
14:47
really talks about it I also will leave
14:49
a link to an entire series of videos
14:51
about scenes and conflict and goals and
14:54
everything on km wyland's blog where she
14:56
talks about
14:58
um scene and sequel but basically the
15:00
idea is that when something happens in a
15:02
scene that causes change or causes your
15:04
character to recalibrate or need to
15:06
emotionally respond to it you follow
15:09
that scene or that action with a quick
15:11
response scene and that's the sequel so
15:14
it's just a emotional response to what's
15:16
just happened potentially a
15:18
recalibration or a moment where your
15:20
character says wow okay I'm processing
15:22
what just happened and now I'm coming up
15:23
with my next plan and now we're gonna go
15:26
do that thing so the sequel is more of
15:28
an emotional beat a lot of times it's
15:30
like a recalibration and reaction where
15:33
your character then makes a decision of
15:35
how to move forward so I will address
15:37
this more when we get into the structure
15:39
of scenes coming up but I did want to
15:41
mention that because it does play into
15:43
the character Arc so if you want to read
15:45
more about that the two books that I
15:46
would most recommend you pick up are
15:48
scene and structure by Jack bickham and
15:50
either structuring your novel by K.M
15:52
Weiland or her book creating character
15:54
arcs both of them are brilliant another
15:57
final note before we go on this second
15:59
video is to just touch up on multiple
16:02
POV characters so when it comes to
16:05
writing your scenes and you have like
16:08
five to eight or however many multiple
16:11
point of view characters if several are
16:14
in the same room how do you decide who
16:16
gets the point of view in any given
16:18
scene now I used to kind of feel like oh
16:20
Harper had a scene so now it's Jackson's
16:23
turn and try to kind of rotate them but
16:25
the more experienced I got with writing
16:27
scenes the more I understood that it's
16:29
really not about giving each character
16:31
the same amount of page time but instead
16:33
it's really about choosing which point
16:36
of view is most appropriate for that
16:38
scene and the way you do that is by
16:40
asking those questions and thinking
16:42
about who out of all these characters
16:44
Whose desire are we talking about in
16:47
this scene Whose desire and goal is
16:49
first and foremost and if it's a group
16:51
goal and desire who has the most at
16:54
stake when it comes to this who is going
16:56
to be the person that is the most
16:57
invested or has the most to lose or is
17:00
going to experience the transformation
17:01
when it comes to that so hopefully just
17:03
that little bit will help you decide for
17:05
yourself who gets the who gets the point
17:08
of view in this scene because who has
17:10
the most at stake who has the most
17:11
transformation that's coming and think
17:13
about those six questions and which
17:15
character it most applies to in terms of
17:17
the goal of the scene
Closing Thoughts
17:19
I hope this look into characters and
17:21
scenes was helpful for you in video
17:23
three of this series we're gonna dive
17:25
deep into conflict which of course if
17:28
you don't have conflict you really don't
17:30
have a novel it's so incredibly
17:32
important and the tension and the
17:34
intensity of tension in your book is
17:36
really what's going to keep readers
17:38
engaged every single page every single
17:40
time that you're writing and it's going
17:41
to make them want to read everything
17:43
you've ever written so conflict is super
17:45
important give your readers a character
17:47
they care about with Stakes that seem
17:50
important in some way and then throw as
17:52
much Conflict at that character as you
17:54
can that relates to the overall plot and
17:57
you're gonna have a really good story so
17:58

Intro
0:00
as writers we hear an awful lot about
0:02
plot and story structure but in my
0:05
opinion we don't really hear enough
0:07
about writing scenes but in truth scenes
0:10
are where the story happens everything
0:13
in your story happens within a series of
0:16
scenes and so in this next video series
0:19
we're going to be talking about how to
0:21
take that big idea of plot and really
0:24
flesh it out into individual scenes that
0:26
will keep your readers engaged and
0:28
turning pages late into the night so my
Writing Great Scenes
0:30
name is sarah cannon welcome to heart
0:33
breathings this is going to be a
0:34
five-part series called writing great
0:36
scenes and i'm excited to get started
0:39
[Music]
0:44
with plot you have overarching structure
0:47
which is great because you need some
0:49
kind of structure to any story that
0:51
you're telling but that's where a lot of
0:53
writers get stuck trying to figure out
0:55
how those plot points actually connect
0:57
and come together to create your story
1:00
imagine that you're building a house so
1:02
you need a foundation and you need the
1:05
basic structure right but if you don't
1:07
have walls and drywall and plumbing and
1:09
electricity and decor and lighting and
1:12
all of those things then it's not really
1:14
a very livable house and the same is
1:16
true for your story so it's great to
1:19
have the overarching structure but
1:21
unless you fill it with dialogue and
1:24
interesting characters and conflict and
1:26
action and
1:27
you know story then you don't really
1:29
have a readable engaging
1:31
story so plot is definitely
1:35
a good place to start but it's really
1:37
when you start to understand the
1:39
structure and the depth of how to create
1:41
really good engaging scenes that your
1:43
writing really starts to come alive all
1:46
of the action the character development
1:49
all of the plot points that you come up
1:51
with all of this happens within the
1:53
structure of
1:54
scenes a series of scenes you may have
1:56
heard that common phrase before that
1:59
scenes are the building blocks of your
2:01
novel and that is absolutely true
2:03
i think km weiland likes to call them
2:05
dominoes because it's really a cause and
2:07
effect so lisa crone in her book story
2:10
genius says that it is a cause and
2:13
effect trajectory so that means that
2:15
every single thing that happens in your
2:17
book leads to another thing and then
2:19
knocks down another domino and that
2:20
leads to another thing and so learning
2:23
how to write great scenes is about
2:25
really not only writing a great mini
2:27
story inside each scene but then
2:30
connecting it to the scenes that come
2:32
before and after it in a cohesive way
2:34
that begin to play off of each other and
2:37
this is where it can start to feel a
2:38
little bit overwhelming so trust me that
2:41
we are going to take this and break it
2:42
down tiny step by tiny step and it is my
2:45
hope that by the end of this five part
2:46
series you are going to feel really
2:48
excited about sitting down and writing
2:51
scenes for your book now in this series
2:53
i am going to be sharing a lot of what i
2:55
have learned in my own experience of
2:57
over a decade of writing professionally
2:59
writing more than 27 novels and of
3:02
course i'll be referencing some of the
3:04
teachers and great authors that i have
3:06
learned from and as always i will have a
3:09
list of some of my favorite books on
3:11
character development dialogue scene
3:13
structure and some of the greatest
3:15
resources that i have found throughout
3:17
my career as a writer so you can find
3:19
those in the description box below and
3:21
you can find them in the free workbook
3:24
so you guys know me if you've been
3:25
around for a while i love to create
3:27
workbooks that will help you to really
3:30
take what you've learned here and put it
3:33
in action for your own story so i have
3:34
created a workbook that accompanies this
3:36
five part series and if you are on my
3:39
newsletter list it is now in your hp
3:41
resource library and if you're not on my
3:43
newsletter list all you have to do is
3:45
click the link down below in the
3:47
description join and you will get
3:49
instant access to this workbook as well
3:51
as many others that i have in my
3:53
resource library okay so let's get
What Is A Scene?
3:56
started what is a scene
3:59
according to webster's dictionary a
4:01
scene is a single interesting or
4:03
important happening in a play or story
4:06
so it's pretty vague
4:08
a single interesting moment or point
4:10
some people like to say that a scene is
4:13
any time you have like a unique
4:15
combination of characters or setting and
4:19
any time that shifts like a new
4:20
character enters the room or the setting
4:22
changes then the scene also ends and a
4:24
new scene begins
4:26
i don't always know that it's that cut
4:28
and dry for me i think it's an
4:30
individual choice in terms of what you
4:32
would like to define as an individual
4:34
scene for me it feels like it's all
4:36
about transition so anytime you have
4:39
something happening and then something
4:41
comes in to interrupt that either you've
4:43
got a change of location or you have a
4:45
transition to a new set of characters or
4:48
a transition to a new topic or something
4:51
like that then one scene has ended and
4:53
another scene has begun i think often
4:56
choosing when a scene starts and ends is
4:59
a very intuitive process for a writer so
5:01
i would say don't get so hung up on the
5:03
definition of a scene but just trust
5:05
yourself to know that when you feel that
5:07
a transition has come that something has
5:09
come to an end and now it's time for
5:11
something new that you've got a new
5:13
scene on your hands sometimes it's going
5:15
to be really obvious like something
5:17
happens that's like a twist moment and
5:20
then it jumps to a totally different
5:22
location or a totally different set of
5:23
characters you know you've got a new
5:25
scene sometimes it's going to be less
5:27
obvious so if you have a couple that's
5:29
been at dinner and they carry their
5:31
conversation out onto the street to walk
5:33
home or to get a cab
5:35
is the scene changing just because they
5:37
left the restaurant
5:38
maybe maybe not i think that's going to
5:39
be up to you but don't get so hung up on
5:42
the definitions of how other people see
5:44
it and really trust yourself and your
5:46
own intuition which leads me to another
5:49
point as we get started here that of
5:51
course i'm gonna share my knowledge but
5:53
when it comes to writing and craft
5:56
there's really no one size fits all for
5:58
everyone there are no rules that can't
6:00
be broken or there are no like this is
6:04
the only way a kind of situations it's
6:06
just what works for you and what doesn't
6:08
so throughout this entire series i hope
6:10
that you'll learn what you can
6:12
add your comments to the conversation
6:15
down below if you have other things to
6:16
add and take what works for you and
6:18
dismiss anything else because one
6:21
person's opinion or what they've learned
6:23
over the years doesn't necessarily work
6:25
for you and that is okay but like i said
6:27
for me i think of scenes in terms of
6:30
transitions or one sort of encapsulated
6:34
little moment it's sort of like a mini
6:36
story so you have the overarching story
6:39
and then you have these tiny little
6:41
moments these tiny mini stories that
6:43
string together to make up the whole
6:45
plot of your story and so it's an
6:47
intuitive thing it could be a transition
6:49
to a new character to a new setting it
6:51
could be someone new entering the room
6:53
it could be the conversation changes but
6:55
i always look for those transitions and
6:58
the feel of it but to be clear what i'm
7:00
not talking about is chapters so some
7:03
writers will make every chapter a new
7:05
scene sometimes i do this in my own
7:08
writing so i will sometimes have very
7:10
short chapters because it's just a very
7:12
short scene
7:13
however some writers will put three or
7:16
four scenes into a single chapter and
7:18
it's really just a matter of your
7:20
personal choice and your personal
7:21
writing style or what's more common in
7:23
your genre so what we're not talking
7:25
about in this series is chapters and i
7:28
want to just make that clear instead
7:30
we're talking about scenes and how you
7:32
arrange that into chapters is going to
7:33
be a topic for another day but for me i
7:37
always think of a scene as a mini story
7:40
so you've got the overarching story
7:42
that's your plot told through you know
7:45
the entire book but you also have a
7:48
series of many stories little
7:50
conversations between characters small
7:53
realizations a new development in some
7:56
way or something that changes the story
7:58
so you have a series of mini stories and
8:01
those are the scenes and i see them in
8:04
terms of transitions so whenever a new
8:06
character enters the room or we've
8:09
finally
8:10
found out this big piece of news that we
8:12
were looking for or a big action scene
8:15
has ended and we transitioned to
8:16
something else i think intuitively you
8:18
can feel that transition from one scene
8:21
to the next but let me know in the
8:23
comments down below how you define a
8:25
scene and how you determine when a scene
8:27
starts or ends and we'll talk about that
8:29
more as the series goes on engaging
Character With A Goal
8:31
scenes usually have i think the
8:33
following five components to them
8:36
one being a point of view character a
8:38
single point of view character hopefully
8:40
one that your reader is invested in or
8:43
cares about what happens to in some kind
8:45
of way who has a clear goal or desire
8:48
they are trying to get something they're
8:50
trying to learn something they're trying
8:52
to find something or escape from
8:54
somewhere they have something that
8:56
they're trying to do or obtain or
8:59
something they desire
9:00
and in some way that's what this scene
9:03
is about what they're trying to get or
9:05
do their goal or desire number two a
Clear Setting
9:07
clear setting so we don't want the
9:09
readers to be confused about where this
9:11
scene is taking place we want the reader
9:13
to feel fully oriented in where we are
9:16
and what that setting is telling us
9:18
about the world itself and it's of
9:22
course as we talk about world building
9:24
what we're talking about is world
9:26
building through a series of scenes
9:27
through the eyes of the characters
9:29
they're always telling us show don't
9:30
tell and when it comes to world building
9:33
instead of just saying here's the world
9:34
that my character lives in you're going
9:36
to show that through setting and through
9:39
the interactions that your character has
9:41
with that setting or with the people in
9:42
that setting so a clear setting reader
9:45
knows where we are now of course there's
9:46
always going to be exceptions to these
9:48
rules so maybe sometimes the setting
9:50
isn't so clear because you're purposely
9:52
trying to ask questions have the readers
9:54
ask questions but for the most part a
Conflict or Obstacle
9:57
clear setting is important number three
9:59
a point of tension or conflict so
10:02
conflict is also really just an obstacle
10:05
to your character's goals so they're
10:07
trying to escape someone comes in and
10:09
catches them and puts them back in
10:11
prison your character is trying to get
10:13
information out of someone and the
10:14
witness won't talk you your character is
10:16
trying to tell someone how they feel
10:18
about them but someone else keeps coming
10:20
in and interrupting there's a million
10:22
ways to put conflict and tension into a
10:24
scene but it is one of the most
10:26
important things every single scene
10:28
needs to have some kind of conflict it
10:30
can be super overt and action or it can
10:33
be subtle and emotional but there always
10:35
needs to be some sort of focus point of
10:39
tension and conflict in your story and
10:41
if you can get really good at layering
10:43
conflict where you have multiple layers
10:46
of internal and external conflict going
10:48
on at the same time then you've really
10:50
got readers on the edge of their seats
10:52
so we're going to talk a lot more about
10:53
conflict in this series number four a
Purpose and Connection
10:56
connection to the scenes that came
10:59
before and after and to the story goal
11:02
as a whole in other words your scene
11:04
needs to have some kind of purpose and
11:05
it needs to move the story forward in
11:07
some way so we're going to talk about
11:09
this more in a separate video as well
11:11
but basically one of the biggest
11:13
mistakes that i see a lot of newer
11:15
writers making is that they create
11:17
scenes because they know they want to
11:18
show you something about your character
11:20
or something about the world but they're
11:22
not connecting that scene to anything
11:25
else that happens later in the book so
11:26
it just feels like a random scene that
11:28
doesn't really have a purpose that's
11:30
connected or woven into the story or
11:33
plot as a whole when you get really good
11:36
at writing engaging scenes and engaging
11:38
stories you're gonna understand the
11:40
connection between the scenes and the
11:44
overall plot of the story and every
11:46
single scene needs to have a goal and it
11:49
needs to have a purpose in terms of
11:51
forwarding the entire plot or your
11:53
character's arc in some way number five
Outcome and Change
11:56
an outcome that stimulates some kind of
11:58
change and then leads us to the next
12:01
scene so
12:02
lisa crone in her book story genius i
12:05
actually have it right here this book
12:06
which will be listed down below with a
12:08
lot of others that i love she calls this
12:10
an escalating cause and effect
12:13
trajectory and i just love that because
12:14
that basically encapsulate what scenes
12:17
do so every single scene should be
12:20
intensifying and escalating this idea of
12:22
cause and effect or what jack beckham
12:24
calls stimulus and response so we're
12:26
gonna get into that as we go through
12:28
this series but basically every single
12:30
scene needs to have some kind of outcome
12:33
that changes things it changes your
12:35
character's mind changes their point of
12:37
view or how they see something it
12:39
changes their circumstances but somehow
12:42
it changes it km weiling calls this a
12:44
disaster i think also jack beckham does
12:46
so something happens to your character
12:49
they don't get the goal they were
12:50
looking for because of that obstacle
12:52
and it ends in some kind of
12:54
result or outcome that leads us into the
12:57
next decision the next action the next
13:00
part of the story and all of these five
The Series
13:02
components need to work together in
13:04
perfect harmony so this is where we
13:08
understand that sometimes writing great
13:11
scenes is really what your story is all
13:13
about and it can make or break you as a
13:15
writer in this five part series we are
13:17
going to go through some of these five
13:19
elements in greater detail and we're
13:22
going to cover things like why your
13:24
character needs a goal or a desire and
13:27
how that plays into their overall
13:29
character arc as well as the overall
13:31
story structure we're going to talk
13:32
about how to really infuse every scene
13:35
with great conflict and that doesn't
13:37
just mean action or battle or arguments
13:39
it can mean subtle things as well so
13:41
we're going to talk about those the
13:42
different feel of conflict and different
13:44
examples of conflict we're going to talk
13:46
about scene structure and we're going to
13:49
talk about something that jack beckham
13:51
called scene and sequel which is really
13:54
about like i said stimulus and response
13:56
and how that plays into the pacing of
13:58
your overall novel and we're going to
14:00
talk about how each scene organically
14:02
connects all the pieces of the puzzle to
14:04
create that overall plot that we're so
14:08
familiar with of course anytime we're
14:10
talking about the craft of writing like
14:12
i said there are going to be exceptions
14:13
to the rules but there is value in
14:16
understanding the basic fundamentals of
14:19
what goes into a great scene so that
14:20
then you as the writer and the artist
14:24
can take it and make it your own and
14:25
play with it from a place of intention
14:28
and purpose and that's when you really
14:30
start to get power as a writer when you
14:32
understand the fundamentals and then you
14:34
begin to play off of readers
14:36
expectations and you're going to get
14:38
them turning pages late into the night
14:40
and buying every book you've ever
14:42
written once i as a writer really
14:45
started to understand how each scene
14:47
organically leads into the next and how
14:50
no individual scene stands alone that
14:52
somehow it has a purpose for either the
14:56
character's arc or for the story's arc
14:58
or even for the series arc and how
15:00
everything plays off of each other like
15:02
cause and effect
15:04
my writing became so much stronger so my
15:06
hope for you in this series is to help
15:08
you have hopefully a few light bulb
15:10
moments of your own as you're trying to
15:12
take this big idea of story structure
15:15
and figure out how to break that down
15:16
into tiny little scenes or moments or
15:19
mini stories that make up your whole
15:20
plot so i'm excited to take you on this
15:23
journey i hope that you find this
15:24

this weekend at the authortube writing
17:14
conference which is a free conference
17:16
here on youtube so check the description
17:18
box for all the links all right i will
17:20
see you guys in that next video

dialogue is one of the most important and essential tools of any fiction
0:05
writer so this is essentially just the conversations that are happening in your story between your different characters
0:12
but it's so much more than that as a tool and one of the tricks of being a great author is being able to become the
0:20
voice of a bunch of different characters and a bunch of different people which in some ways is like stepping into that
0:27
character's head so that you can become their voice so it really is an amazing
0:32
tool and once you learn how to harness it you are going to be writing stories that keep your readers up late into the
0:38
night and that really resonate with your with your reader so let's talk about
0:46
dialogue today what we're going to do is we're going to talk about some of the ways that you can use dialogue as a tool
0:52
just to get you thinking we're not going to go into Super like a lot of depth on this because I feel like I could do a
0:58
video on each one of these so if you'd ever be interested in a whole series on dialogue let me know because I'm already
1:04
putting together ideas for next year's writing series but then we're also going to talk about how do you actually write
1:10
good dialogue not only how do you make each character's voice unique but how do you weave it together in a story with
1:16
narrative and action and then finally I'm going to give you some tips for those of you that are punctuation or
1:21
grammar challenged I'm going to give you some tips on how to actually write your dialogue tags with punctuation and your
1:27
attributions in your story so we have a lot to cover today it's probably going to be another longer video but we're
1:33
ready to get started so let's talk about how to use dialogue as a tool so obviously one of the biggest Tools in
Dialogue As A Tool
1:40
terms of dialogue is that it becomes your character's voice it's going to
1:46
reveal to us your character's personalities and most of all their motivations so when we think about
1:53
dialogue and we think about every single word that comes out of each character's mouth we also need to be thinking about
1:59
what is that character care about what are the types of things that they notice what triggers them what makes them angry
2:05
what are they trying to hide are they nervous are they awkward are they excited every single word that comes out
2:12
of their mouth is going to tell us how they're feeling about something how they're reacting to something and the
2:17
manner in which they speak which of course over time reveals what they care about and what their motivations and
2:23
goals are so be thinking about that when you think about your character's voice but the second tool is that your voice
2:30
of your character your dialogue also informs the genre that you're writing and the tone of your story so for
2:38
example someone who is writing you know Victoria England is going to have characters whose dialogue is very
2:44
different from someone who's writing Texas in 2023 so you want to make sure
2:49
that your dialogue stays true not only to your character's individual voice but also to the time period their education
2:56
their background and to the setting of your novel and the the World building of your novel and if you are interested in
3:02
learning more about World building I do have a video that we've just done for propt toer so I will link that for you down below because all of these things
3:09
tend to go hand inand and make your tools so much stronger and more Vivid
3:14
when you've got the World building the setting and you have this description mixed with dialogue it's just incredible
3:21
how we can use these tools to create such different and unique stories so just to give an example of genre I write
3:29
mostly young adult and new adult contemporary fantasy style stories and so I wouldn't necessarily want a
3:35
character who speaks like I am so very perplexed at the absolutely terrible way
3:41
that you have been treating me that sounds so stiff it doesn't sound like a natural thing that would come out of a
3:46
teenager's voice right out of a teenager's mouth so instead they might say something like what the hell why are
3:52
you treating me like this that sounds a lot more natural to the character but then again if you are writing a
3:58
character who specifically spoke in a certain way or like to use big words and they you were trying to show their
4:05
personality and their motivations through their language they might speak very differently and they may never say the word hell because that's not their
4:11
type of character right so we need to think about who our character is what type of upbringing they've had what are
4:18
their values because all of that is going to be reflected but we also need to think about the tone of our story and
4:23
the genre of our story and make sure that the words that are coming through in dialogue actually match up with that
4:30
tone that we're trying to convey another piece of dialogue as a tool is that it's always showing conflict and tension in
4:37
your story so really at the heart of it dialogue should always be bringing some
4:43
kind of tension into your story so beware of long sweeping scenes where
4:49
there's nothing going on but just a casual chat between friends there should be some type of internal conflict or
4:56
external conflict that is bringing tension to your SC scene it could be to friends that are talking but the way
5:02
that your character is responding to it or the information that she's getting is going against what her goal is for that
5:08
scene so again this is where understanding your character's goal and every scene can really play into your
5:15
dialogue because what your character wants to achieve in this scene might be
5:21
thwarted or they might be getting information that they don't want or they're receiving conflict or they're not able to get to their goal or get to
5:28
the outcome they want because of the conversation that is happening there so it could be some kind of truth that's
5:34
revealed some kind of backstory that's revealed someone who's standing in their way or they're afraid to really say how
5:40
they feel all of these things add conflict and tension and really what we want to create when we're having
5:46
conversations between characters is more tension in our story because that's what
5:51
keeps people reading so go through your dialogue and make sure that every scene
5:57
has a purpose and that any type of conversation that you're having has some kind of tension in it now that doesn't
6:03
mean that your characters always need to be arguing with each other it just means that we want to have some kind of give
6:09
and take with your character's goal for the scene that is preventing them from getting exactly what they wanted or is
6:16
presenting some kind of information or some kind of criticism or any other thing like that that is holding your
6:22
character back or keeping them from what their goal is in the scene and if you want to hear a little bit more about on
6:28
an individual scene basis how you figure out your character's goal and motivation and the outcome I do have an entire
6:34
video on writing good scenes I have a whole series on it with a workbook and everything so I will link that for you
6:40
down below as well it's this tension that moves our stories forward and so always be thinking about that tension
6:46
when it comes to your characters another tool for dialogue is also the pacing of your story so dialogue can make your
6:53
story move faster because when readers see that white space on the page because there's a lot of dialogue happening and
6:59
each speech of your character is a new paragraph there's a lot of white space on the side like just take any book off
7:05
of your shelf and kind of thumb through it and you can usually tell which passages have more dialogue than others
7:12
and we can use that as a tool that if we want to speed up the pace and we want to
7:17
increase the tension and and the have the readers reading faster we might add more rapid fire dialogue
7:24
unless expansion or narrative or other things that are going on around your character
7:29
but when you want to slow down the pacing sometimes you're going to add in a little bit more Exposition or a little
7:35
bit more internal narrative so that you've got a little bit of dialogue long
7:40
sort of sweeping narrative or noticing what your character's thinking every tiny little thing and then a little bit
7:46
more and we're sort of portioning that out in a slower way we can actually take control over how fast our readers are
7:53
reading versus slowing things down a little bit and that's a great tool to understand how to use effectively in
7:59
your own fiction so another thing that people often ask me is how do I reveal
Backstory
8:04
backstory without just these huge long info dumps right we often as authors
8:09
know a lot more about the backstory and the history of our location and our characters than we'll ever actually make
8:16
it into the novel on the page and we want to be careful that we don't start a book or introduce characters with just
8:23
long blocks of text that just dump all of the information that we might need to
8:28
know about an area or character so this is where dialogue can come into play
8:33
that we can often use dialogue to show backstory setting relationships and
8:39
their history so I know that this may not be the best fiction in the world but
8:44
I will use my own example so The Trouble With Goodbye is a new adult contemporary romance that I wrote uh all the way back
8:51
in 2013 and we have this character the main character is Leanne and she's coming
8:57
home from college to her small hometown town and she's having a lunch out at a cafe with some of her high school
9:03
friends and so of course there might be some tension there that I want to show but also Leanne has noticed while
9:09
they're sitting at this Outdoor Cafe that a guy she had a runin with the other day is unloading boxes across the
9:15
street and he was very nice to her but he's new to this town and she doesn't know much about him so rather than
9:22
having some kind of long info dump in here or having him explain to her what his backstory is I wanted to add tension
9:28
and mystery around this guy and who he is and where he came from so you will start to see hopefully very clearly and
9:35
I want you to pay attention in this little passage I'm going to read about a page and a half to how I'm weaving in
9:41
the dialogue with narrative so I'm showing my character's internal thoughts as well in terms of what they're
9:48
thinking and how they're reacting to what their friends are saying but I'm also revealing a little bit about the
9:53
setting and the town and the culture here as well as this guy's backstory
10:00
Penny waves her hand in front of my face and I blink and turn my attention back to her and the rest of the girls sorry
10:07
what were you saying I take a bite of my club sandwich even though I'm not very hungry um no she says she turns
10:14
deliberately and gaws at KNX across the street you can't spend 10 straight minutes staring at some guy across the
10:20
street and then pretend it's nothing what's up I tread lightly do you know
10:26
him all three girls turned to stare at him and he notices a half smile tugs at
10:32
his lips and even from here I can tell he's looking right at me when he lifts his head in a nod of recognition I want
10:38
to die of embarrassment when the others turn around he goes back to unloading boxes from the back of his truck I know
10:45
I should look away but every time he picks up a box the muscles in his arms tighten against the sleeve of his black
10:50
T-shirt and it does something to my insides plus the guy just looks good in jeans that's KNX Warner summer says he
10:59
moved here probably a few months after you left Crystal crinkles her nose and leans forward don't waste your time she
11:07
says in a mock whisper trust me on this one I narrow my eyes at her a weird
11:12
tightness squeezes my chest what do you mean did you guys go out or something
11:18
she shakes her head and her eyes grow wide no are you kidding me she leans forward even further he moved here from
11:26
Chicago or somewhere like that but he spent something like 3 years in jail up there for drugs and assault I heard he
11:32
practically killed some guy with his bare hands my mouth drops open and I carefully close it and try to hide my
11:38
shock I look over at Knox but have such a hard time reconciling the sweet guy who was just so nice to me the other
11:44
night to this story about a drugie who almost killed someone I don't buy it
11:50
does he work over there the answer is obvious I guess since he's been unloading boxes for the past half hour
11:56
still I want to know I want to understand why a guy like him would even move to a small town like this just to
12:02
get a job at some Dive Bar it's his uncle's bar Penny says I think he works
12:08
there full-time to help them out and then he lives over their garage he's a loser Lee like crystal said don't waste
12:15
your time she smiles and sits back in her chair a devilish look in her eyes trust me there are much prettier boys at
12:22
the college parties you'll see so again using my own stuff makes me
12:29
feel a little bit vulnerable because I know it opens me up for criticism but the point is that I want you to see how
12:35
I'm weaving action the characters are not just sitting there sipping tea they're actually eating sandwiches
12:40
they're turning around they're expressing themselves they're sitting back in their chair so we have that action there but we also have this
12:47
dialogue that shows tension between the characters like one character moved away and now she's back and she's kind of
12:53
getting back into the swing of what life is like with these friends that she used to have and then she obviously is
12:59
attracted to this guy but doesn't know much about him and here's this girl telling her he's a complete loser he has
13:05
this awful back story that just makes him Untouchable trust me you don't want to go there which makes Leanne
13:11
uncomfortable because she really likes him and he was really nice to her and something isn't matching up there for the reader that brings out immediate
13:18
tension and we want to know what is his real story and how could he be so nice to her did he actually kill a guy like
13:25
that can't be real so we are immediately just in a page and a half brought into
13:30
the world of these characters through the weaving of their dialogue and this simple conversation but I've also
13:38
revealed that backstory and there's so much that you can do with dialogue you can communicate the theme of your story
13:44
and your own personal values through dialogue you can definitely tell us everything we need to know about your
13:50
character through their dialogue we can also set up the world describe the
13:55
setting we can reveal Clues we can hide things in dialogue it's such a powerful and necessary tool but one of the ways
14:02
that most authors struggle with dialogue is how do I actually write it and how do I make every single voice unique so I'm
Know Your Characters
14:09
going to give you some tools for that coming up next so if you want to know how to write great dialogue the number
14:15
one most important most essential thing is to know your characters know them
14:21
inside and out and I think sometimes this is where people stumble because it will come down to your personal writing
14:27
process that maybe don't know your characters inside and out when you get started and that's okay because writing
14:33
is a journey right very few of us write one single draft and then we're done
14:38
with the story I'm already on the third draft of The Disappearance of Vanessa Shaw that has eight separate points of
14:43
view and so each time I'm changing up these characters and in fact one character got a major shift From the
14:49
Rough Draft to how she is now so sometimes as we're writing these characters they will reveal themselves
14:55
to us so make sure you have a way to capture your notes about each character
15:00
I do it right inside my Google doc that when a character says something that feels natural to them but it's different
15:06
than the way I imagine that character to be I will just make a note in a Google doc that says why is she acting like
15:11
this what am I not understanding about this character because sometimes our subconscious already understands who
15:17
this character needs to be for the story but we just haven't quite discovered it or pulled it out so a lot of the
15:23
discovery of who your character is and what they want and what they care about is going to come through when you're
15:28
actually writing your rough draft so don't feel like you have to have them all figured out ahead of time however if
15:34
you do want to make each character distinct there are some tools that you can use before you start writing or even
15:41
while you're writing to really figure them out so the first is the inag so I'm
15:46
sure many of you are familiar with personality tests like Myers Briggs or inag or strengths test and things like
15:53
that but inag is really one that gives us some pretty basic archetypes that are
15:58
are very clear and so a lot of times we can take those inag I think there's 10 but correct me if I'm wrong I don't
16:04
personally use in inogram in my writing but I know some writers who do and it really changes the game for them so it's
16:10
like I'm an inag 3 the achiever so how would the achiever react in a c certain
16:16
situation what would that kind of person care about as opposed to someone who was more like a nurturer or someone who was
16:23
more a helper type person there's going to be different personalities there so if you really want want to assign your
16:29
character like a specific archetype you can work with there's a book called Heroes and heroins there are lots of
16:35
books about various types of archetypes of characters and then you've got tools
16:40
like the inogram or Myers Briggs and you can really dive in if that is fun for you to the personality of your character
16:47
and that can really inform how they act and what their dialogue sounds like what the what types of things they say when
16:53
they speak because we're going to see what types of things they care about and what motivates them speaking of
16:59
motivation Deborah Dixon's book goal motivation and conflict is also a must
17:04
read and such a valuable tool when it comes to identifying what your character really wants what motivates them what is
17:12
it that is standing in their way now a lot of times we won't go through the GMC
17:17
or goal motivation Conflict for every single side character because we're really just thinking about our main
17:22
character and how that informs the story but if you get stuck on a side character and you just can't fixure figure out
17:28
their voice or what they care about take a minute to do the box that I have in my
17:34
how to plot your novel that deals with Goal motivation conflict so if you really want to dive into it got to buy
17:41
Deborah Dixon's book on this GMC I will link it for you down below and I will also have a video coming up about mustre
17:48
books um on writing so that's coming up hopefully this weekend and it will definitely be on that list but it's so
17:55
important to understand at the heart of your character what is
18:00
it they most care about and what is it they want what's their desire in this
18:05
story and a lot of times you may have like with with these characters that are all sitting at this Cafe you've got
18:13
these girls what do they want from Leanne like Leanne is trying so hard to
18:19
reassimilate back into this life because she's had a trauma at college and she wants to just feel at peace and secure
18:26
again but coming home is not as easy as she thought it would be so she wants to try to reconnect with her friends but
18:33
what they want is for her to be exactly the way that she used to be and that's not who she is anymore which is why
18:39
she's looking across the street at this guy but understanding each of those character's motivation helped me to
18:46
write that scene in a way that resonates with people because we understand that situation and we understand how lean
18:53
feels to come home and not really connect with her old friends the way she used to and that's a universal
18:58
experience and I think once we really start to dive into that and tap into those Universal experiences and show it
19:05
in the dialogue because we understand who our characters are and how they're evolving that's when we really start to
19:11
write fiction that emotionally resonates with our readers another tool that you can use is just a simple old character
19:19
interview so if you want to figure out each character before you get started for nanor rimo or anytime you're writing
19:25
a book just sit down and ask some questions you can do this literally on a voice recorder on your phone or in a
19:31
Google doc just open up a separate Google doc and say okay Leanne what is it she wants and you can just literally
19:37
ask your character questions this will pull it forth from your subconscious anything you know about this character
19:43
like what why are you actually coming home to this town how do you feel when you see your old friends how do you feel
19:48
when you see your old boyfriend dating one of your old best friends how does it feel when Knox picked you up after you
19:53
hit that deer the other night like you can ask them questions and just have them answer and then you don't have the
19:59
stress and pressure of it's got to be perfect and it has to fit into my novel but it's just a getting to know you kind
20:05
of thing you could also have someone like a critique partner or a partner of yours ask you questions and then you
20:12
answer as if you or that character sometimes that really helps sometimes once we've written a letter or like have
20:18
your character write a letter to you about what's important to them in this story what is it they really want and
20:24
sometimes just spending that time thinking about who they are and what they want and where they're going can
20:30
put us into their head right and I write multiple POV so whenever I'm getting
20:36
into that character's head I will Almost Do like a little bit of a meditation before I switch to a different
20:41
character's voice because when you have four to eight different characters that are going to be actually were in their
20:48
head in the story we really need to get into that character's voice and kind of reimagine and reconnect with what is
20:56
important to this character and who are they and so I will literally just sit and do like I know how it sounds cheesy
21:03
but just do like a two or three minutes of centering myself and thinking about this character and getting into their
21:10
emotions and saying okay Eran I know these are the things he cares about these are the wounds that he
21:17
has so I didn't talk about that yet but almost all of our characters have what we call infection a wound or a ghost
21:24
something in the past something that has happened to them that has informed how they are now as a person like what is
21:31
their wound what are they trying to hide from what are they trying to deny in their lives that will eventually become
21:36
pivotal in their character Arc and their transformation and so when I think about
21:41
a character like aan from my Shad demon Saga his wounds are so incredibly like
21:48
terrible and awful the things that he's been through and that makes him feel like he's Unworthy of love like his
21:54
needs don't matter and that he should just be grateful for being free and so I
21:59
really tap into and think through his backstory and where he needs to go and the person he needs to become or the
22:05
demon he needs to become in order to make it to the end of the story so sometimes just really connecting into
22:12
that can make a big difference in your character's voice and just play around with it stop feeling like you got to get
22:18
it perfect right from the start see it as an experiment and a discovery process and that will really serve you but the
22:24
more you can know about your character's backstory what they care about and even uh we talk about the story triangle from
22:31
write your story from the middle by James Scott Bell where he talks about your character's M mirror moment
22:36
figuring out your character's mirror moment is also something that can really help you with their dialogue so again
22:43
we'll go over some of my favorite books on writing but once you begin to understand all these different tools it
22:48
can really be helpful to make your writing that much stronger writing great dialogue is really a balance like I
Balance Dialogue Narrative & Action
22:53
talked about in that previous scene a lot of newer writers will just write a lot of dialogue without any action or
23:01
Exposition or description or other things but if you really want to write something that's rich you need to find a
23:07
way to weave your dialogue in with the setting description your senses a little
23:13
bit of dialogue with uh emotion and action tagged on to it can really be
23:19
helpful and there are going to be times when maybe you're going to have a lot of narrative because maybe the character
23:26
you're trying to set the tone of this character arriving at this new place and how they feel you know coming off this
23:31
boat and seeing this new fantasy world and we're going to want to see that expansive world and there may be almost
23:37
no dialogue in that scene at all but then we're also going to have other scenes where your characters are sitting
23:43
together in a room and the only thing we care about is the dialogue between them and part of becoming a great writer is
23:49
understanding when dialogue is necessary and understanding when it's better just coming through your character's eyes in
23:56
narrative also when whenever you're writing dialogue between characters unless you're trying to make it rapid
24:02
fire and you're trying to really speed up your pace you often want to weave in some kind of action like we have our
24:08
characters are sitting here eating but we see them take a bite of Sandwich take a drink sit back lean forward there's
24:14
action in that scene which then puts our readers into the scene themselves if it
24:19
was just that dialogue that scene would not be as powerful because we wouldn't be able to see the characters we want to
24:26
see their expression we want to hear what they're saying but in conjunction with how they're reacting how they're
24:32
moving and what else is going on in your main character's head at the same time and so really thinking about that
24:38
balance and how to weave it in can be super helpful So speaking of action I'm going to read another scene so this is
24:44
from my book The Witch's key so setup for this particular book is we have a
24:49
young witch in high school who has come to live with her uncle that she barely knows because both of her parents died
24:55
in a tragic like demon hunting experience and there's a strange guy at school that she cannot quite figure out
25:02
what he is but she knows that he's not human and she's never really spoken to him before but she did steal a straw
25:08
from him and cast a spell on it to see if she could figure out exactly what type of magical creature he is she wakes
25:14
up the next morning he's standing there right in front of her house and so here's an example of how I'm weaving in
25:21
that action The Narrative and the emotion with dialogue that speeds up the tension of the scene so the the guy's
25:28
name is Kai and he's confronting her so I'm going to read uh just a couple of a couple of pages here he put a hand on
25:35
the fence behind me and leaned down so close I couldn't see anything beyond those dark eyes of his they seemed to be
25:42
looking inside me I'm not your enemy he said something sincere in his voice
25:48
making my mouth go dry don't make me change my mind on that you've had enough trouble this year I'm sure the council
25:55
would like to keep it that way his words knocked what was left of my breath from my lungs it was like he'd
26:01
physically punched me in the stomach he knew about me about my parents how do you know about the
26:08
council I asked about my parents if you were a member of my coven I'd know about
26:13
it word gets around the community when something like that happens he said for
26:19
the first time since I'd laid eyes on him he had a human expression on his face sorrow
26:25
empathy had I misjudged him I'm sorry for what you went through
26:30
Lenora I don't want anything else to happen to you here he said just stay out of it don't keep digging into my past or
26:37
trying to find answers about me or what's happening in this town leave it alone and I'll do my best to make sure
26:43
you're left alone too his eyes locked on mine for a long moment before he pushed
26:48
off the gate and started walking toward the school leaving me standing there with my mouth open and my heart racing
26:54
wait I shouted somehow managing to find enough strength in and my legs to follow him he stopped but he didn't turn around
27:01
you know my name my past apparently you know everything about me and yet you won't even tell me the most basic thing
27:08
about who you are or how you know all of these things not exactly fair play is it
27:13
you can't expect me to just turn away from that and pretend there's nothing going on here what do you know about
27:18
those missing girls Kai did you do something to them his entire body tensed
27:24
before I could even blink he' grabbed my arm and pulled me tight against him one second he was at least six feet away and
27:29
the next he was almost on top of me and I thought I was fast how did you do that
27:35
I asked breathless I'm not going to warn you again let this go he said loosening his
27:41
grip on me his dark eyes met mine and I could see just how much this meant to him he was serious about it but there
27:47
was something more reflected in his gaze at first I'd mistaken it for anger but I
27:53
could see now I was wrong he was scared but
27:58
what so if you listen through that you can tell it's it wouldn't be just it
28:05
wouldn't be as interesting and gripping of a scene if it was just the dialogue or if it was just the action it's the
28:11
interweaving of the two it's the way that we see the the way he grips her the way he moves really fast the Expressions
28:18
on his face and the way that she's reading them her reactions her feelings as she's talking to him but there's also
28:24
really important information that's coming out through the dial OG he knows about my past he's really a part of this
28:30
world but he's not human and he's also not a witch he's definitely not a part of my coven but he knows more and he's
28:36
telling me not to be a part of this and then suddenly the shift of like wait a
28:42
minute is he actually TR trying to protect me is he actually scared or is he angry and in that we understand Kai's
28:49
motivation because we know that he's trying to get her to back off of this investigation and to leave him alone but
28:55
we understand Lenny or lenora's MO motivation too that she wants to get to the truth of the matter and their
29:01
motivations are clashing with each other which creates the tension in the scene and none of that would have been
29:06
possible without the dialogue so hopefully now you can see how dialogue is such a great tool once you learn how
29:14
to weave narrative action and dialogue and properly tell when is the right time
29:20
for a pause in your dialogue for a little bit of action or to add more tension and make the scene go a little
29:26
faster or a little slower and when is the perfect time for Rapid Fire longer dialogue longer paragraphs of speaking
29:33
and conversations your writing is really going to uplevel okay final part of this video is just some technical tips
Attribution
29:40
because I know especially for newer writers out there sometimes it can be really confusing like how do I do a
29:45
dialogue tag or an attribution how often do I need it and what are some pitfalls
29:51
that I can avoid so let's go through those real quick so first of all a few books that I highly recommend picking up
29:56
if you are not familiar with dialogue tags and sentence structure and these kind of things first one is the elements
30:04
the element of style from shrunk and white this goes into tons of different things about style in your writing also
30:12
this book that is called the art of styling sentences by an long knife and Katie Sullivan it's a very short sort of
30:18
workbook style book but it's really golden in terms of structuring and styling your sentences and then the
30:25
final one is the best punctuation book period so this obviously goes into a lot
30:30
of different punctuation things like colons and punctuation colons and semicolons and you know question marks
30:37
and exclamation marks and all those kind of things but it also talks about proper punctuation within dialogue tags so
30:43
that's some good reading for you I will link those down below as well as my entire list of books that I recommend
30:49
for you uh on my Amazon store so one of the keys when it comes to attribution in your dialogue is that the reader always
30:55
needs to have an understanding of who is speaking and so it's confusing sometimes
31:01
if you have you know three characters let's say in a scene and you've got
31:06
dialogue dialogue dialogue but none of those have any type of attribution to them so you don't know who is saying
31:12
what sometimes we can use what they're saying and what they're talking about so we don't always have to have an
31:19
attribution because it's just going to be understood who is speaking because of what they're saying or what they're
31:24
doing however you want to make sure when you're reading through that you have enough attribution to always understand
31:32
who is speaking because if your reader gets confused wait who's saying what here they're going to be lost in this
31:37
scene and it's going to immediately pull them out of the story and their enjoyment of that scene is going to be completely gone so make sure that you
31:44
don't have any like four or five different exchanges without saying who is speaking you also want to make sure
31:51
when you're putting in that attribution or dialogue tag that you're doing it in a place that falls naturally in their
31:57
speech so for example you wouldn't say I can't believe she said that you did that
32:03
that's such an interruption of the flow of the sentence but you might say I can't believe you did that she said we
32:11
have the whole thought there and we're not breaking it up in a place that doesn't feel natural to our
32:18
speech you also don't always have to use he said or she said you can also place an action or a piece of your character's
32:25
movements or thoughts just before the dialogue to show who's speaking so you could say laurelai moved to sit at the
32:32
table dropping her head into her hands I can't believe you just did that we
32:38
understand that it's laurelai who's speaking because she's the last one who took some kind of action or movement in the scene and we're following her kind
32:44
of in our head with our eyes and we see her sit down put her head in her hands and then she speaks so sometimes we
32:50
don't need a he said she said that kind of dialogue tag we just need some kind of movement or reaction from your
32:56
character to to understand who's speaking another technical thing that confuses some people is that pretty much
33:02
as a hard and fast rule there probably are some exceptions but every single time you have a new set of dialogue a
33:09
new speech so let's say with the girls you have Penny speaking here that's a full paragraph because it's Penny who's
33:16
speaking then the if Crystal begins to speak we would have a brand new paragraph there and then if Leanne
33:22
speaks we have another new paragraph So each time someone speaks we have a new paragraph and often the dialogue itself
33:28
will be its own paragraph and then any type of reaction or movement or action
33:34
will also be its own paragraph sometimes for pacing too you might separate out
33:40
your characters dialogue and then have them take an action and then have them speak again so sometimes you'll have
33:46
your dialogue will be separated by some kind of action or reaction or emotion that they're feeling some type of
33:52
narrative before they speak again and if that is the case often you will have par paragraph then a new paragraph for their
33:59
action and then a new paragraph for the next thing that they say be aware that you're not putting three different characters speaking all in one paragraph
34:06
every time a new character speaks you get a new paragraph a fresh paragraph in your story and of course we would be
34:12
remiss if we did not discuss dialogue tags in terms of verbs and adverbs so in general I think sometimes especially
Dialogue Tags
34:19
with newer authors we get scared to say the word said like he said she said they
34:25
said but really these words this type of dialogue
34:30
tag with he said is invisible to readers because they see it all the time so their mind just naturally skips over
34:36
it's just a way to say who is talking in this sentence or it's a way to break up the sentence and give them a little bit
34:42
of a place to Breathe Right but it's invisible when we start adding verbs and
34:48
adverbs into our dialogue tags we can really start to go super overboard and annoying we can feel like we're adding
34:54
more to the story but really it's taking away from it so what I mean by this is you want to avoid saying I told you not
35:01
to say that he grumbled or why would you do that she said wearily so adding this
35:07
sort of grumbled he shouted he he exclaimed you know these types of extra
35:13
verbs or adverbs she said grumpily there's adding this to it as if we don't
35:20
trust that the reader understands the way that someone is saying something it's so much better than adding like she
35:26
said wearily to say I can't believe you would do that she let her head drop into
35:32
her hands because we see the action we see how she's reacting to it we know
35:37
that she's feeling weary because of the way that she's speaking and the way that she's moving her body we don't need the
35:44
dialogue tag to say she said wearily right we don't need that adverb it could just be she said or we don't even have
35:50
to say she said we just say she took this action and that shows us how she's feeling so a lot of times if you go
35:57
through your work I want you to pay attention to the dialogue tags that you've used and take out the ones that
36:03
you say like he grumbled or he shouted and in fact a lot of newer authors you will see them using dialogue tags of
36:10
things that people can't even do when they say something so they'll say I can't believe you would just do that he
36:16
motioned well motioned is not a description of speech right that's a description of action so someone can't
36:22
motion a dialogue so just make sure that your dialogue tags are all some type of
36:27
speech right a way of speech a way of being but often than not either use he
36:33
said or she said or occasionally he shouted or something like that that tells us their vo is elevated but
36:40
instead of leaving a lot of dialogue tags sometimes mix it up with an action that your character takes or an emotion
36:46
that your character is feeling or a way of expressing themselves on the page other than a dialogue tag that shows us
36:53
how they're feeling so to give you another example so so if in this just pulling through this like instead of
36:59
having to say you couldn't just leave it alone could you Kai said I have Kai moving before he speaks Kai towered in
37:07
the doorway shaking his head so we see what he's doing we know how he's feeling because he's shaking his head and then
37:13
he says you couldn't just leave it alone could you that way I don't need a dialogue tag
37:19
because we've seen Kai in our heads and now when uh when Lenny is going to speak
37:25
it's a new paragraph Payton is gone I said did you take her so we just want to
37:31
make sure that we're giving it that varying sentence structure that we're adding action in that we're adding in
37:36
Emotion we're adding in proper dialogue tags okay so I know this again was a bit of a longer video but I sincerely hope
37:44
that you enjoyed it if you made it all the way to the end leave me a writing emoji down in the comments something
Final Thoughts
37:49
like a book or a pencil or something a typewriter I don't know what cool emojis you can find some down there to let me
37:55
know that you enjoy these longer more in-depth videos I know sometimes it can be easier to digest when you get shorter
38:01
servings but I feel like I can go so much deeper when I can speak on things for a longer period of time so I hope
38:07
you found this super helpful I hope you found the examples helpful if you have any more questions about dialogue please
38:12
let me know another book before we go that I would highly recommend you pick up if you are looking at studying
38:18
dialogue is this book which is another part of the right great fiction series by Gloria Kempton this book on dialogue
38:25
was one of the first I ever read and it is full of uh annotations here because it is such an amazing book about
38:31
dialogue so I highly recommend that you check that out as well as the other books that I've mentioned here today so
38:36
we are more than halfway through the month of October preptober is halfway done let me know if there's any other
38:43
videos that you'd like for me to cover otherwise I'm going to be talking more about potentially pacing or subplot I
38:48
hope you've enjoyed this video I hope you've enjoyed this entire preptober series make sure that you are subscribed
38:54
to this channel also just to let you know today started in my Sarah Canon Channel my writing channel the

39:33
prep is going well and I will see you in my next video [Music]
39:51
bye

welcome back to heart breathings today is probably the most anticipated video of preptober this year which is how to
0:07
outline your book so I am so excited about this because I love outlining it's
0:13
one of my favorite parts of the writing process and I can't wait to talk you through my process and give you some
0:18
tools that might help you with your own book so let's get [Music]
0:25
started I am joining you today with some hot tea because I have caught a little
0:30
bit of a funk from my four-year-old daughter so I am a little bit lower energy today but thankfully this topic
0:37
gives me some energy so what we're going to do today is I'm going to give you a little bit of a pep talk and then I'm
0:43
going to show you top down how I would outline and I'm going to walk you through a process that you could also
0:50
use but I want you to keep in mind that outlining and how much of it you need to
0:55
do or whether you need to do any of it at all is a choice and and it's fully
1:00
your preference and we all have different strengths and weaknesses we all have a different process when it
1:06
comes to writing so what I encourage you to do when you're thinking about this type of process of outlining and
1:12
everything else is to pay attention to what feels good to you because sometimes
1:19
you might see someone else doing something and you think oh I need to do it that way that's how writers do it but
1:24
then when you start doing it it doesn't really work for you and then when you actually go to start writing you're thinking I didn't use any of that
1:30
outlining I wish I had just jumped in and had fun with just discovering the story as I go so one big tip is to give
1:38
yourself permission to just let your process be what works naturally for you
1:43
because you're going to be the expert and the guru of your own process and everything else is just a tool that you
1:49
can pull out of a toolbox so I'm going to give you some tools today that you might be able to use take what works for
1:54
you and just let go of everything else so now comes the pep talk when it comes
Encouragement
2:00
to outlining your story or getting ready for something like nanor rimo or starting a new book sometimes what holds
2:07
us back is this feeling of overwhelm because we're standing at the beginning
2:13
of what feels like a Giant Mountain that we need to climb and we're thinking I don't know how to get from here to there
2:19
and it can feel very overwhelming so my encouragement to you is to take a step back from that overwhelm and instead
2:27
realize that you're going to get through this step by step nobody just sits down and
2:33
snaps their fingers and immediately knows the plot and the process or the
2:38
steps they're going to follow from beginning to end we are all going through that's why they call it a craft
2:44
that's why we call it a writing process is because we're all going through steps to get where we want to go so let me
2:50
give you an example I live in the Dallas Texas area if I wanted to drive to New
2:56
York City I could get in my car and without any tool tools or any idea of what to do it would feel pretty
3:03
overwhelming because I'm like uh I think I just need to go kind of like Northeast but I don't know how far north I don't
3:09
know the best path through I don't want to waste time I don't want to end up in a place that's unsafe but if I focused
3:15
on how big of a journey this is it could feel really really overwhelming however once I start to
3:22
realize that I have tools at my disposal I have you know internet and GPS and I
3:27
have maps and other things that I can use now I know and I can have faith at the beginning of the journey that even
3:33
though I don't know every step along the way every turn every place I'm going to stop for dinner or all of those details
3:40
I can feel confident that I'm going to get to New York City as long as I keep turning to those tools and taking it one
3:46
turn at a time one decision at a time everything's going to work out I want
3:52
you to approach the beginning of writing your novel in the same way having faith
3:58
that as long as you stick with it and you use the tools that you pull out of different tool boxes that we have as
4:03
writers and you continue to take it one step one turn one decision in your story
4:09
at a time you know that you will eventually get to that novel so take a step back from the pressure of I have to
4:15
have it all figured out and this has to someday become a novel that's going to be good enough to sell or to read or to
4:21
make me you know a bestselling author take that pressure out of it here at the beginning of the process use what gives
4:27
you energy and excitement like oh this is my first book this is so exciting or oh my gosh I get to write this next book
4:33
in the series use the things that give you energy but try to let go of the things that make you feel overwhelmed or
4:39
that at all make you feel like you can't do it because I promise you the same way that you could get into your car right
4:45
now and get to New York City taking it one turn at a time you can sit down and figure out this plot and the outline and
4:53
step byep in your manuscript and in your plotting tools you will figure this out
4:58
I have complete faith in you but sometimes it can just hold us back to have that eagle eye view of like oh my
5:04
gosh I have so much I have to figure out so take that pressure off yourself and let's talk about some ways that you can
5:10
actually sit down and plot this out okay brainstorming and outlining this is some
Prepare To Outline
5:15
of my favorite part of the writing process and this is where a lot of the ideas start to flow and I love using
5:22
lots of colorful tools washi tape different colors of posits and Page flags and things like that but of course
5:28
none of this is necessary it's just the process that's important so you could do this in scrier or Google Docs or on a
5:34
piece of paper with just a plain black pen like none of that type stuff matters it just matters how you're getting your
5:40
ideas onto paper but when I start outlining I usually come to the table
5:47
with already an idea of who my main character is and what this story is about in terms of the premise of the
5:53
story I know the setup of it and the main conflict that's going to happen so is this a romance like I know the genre
6:00
and then I have an idea of like the journey that we're about to go on to a degree so with The Disappearance of
6:06
Vanessa Shaw that I'm currently wrapping up hopefully fingers crossed before Nano I knew going into it that the premise
6:12
was going to be a group of teenagers get together one year after The Disappearance of their friend to
6:17
celebrate her life and they get trapped there potentially with her killer so that is the premise of the story it's a
6:23
murder mystery in terms of genre and it has some potentially Supernatural elements to it and that might all I know
6:30
coming into it but I at least have an idea of the genre of the story and the basics of the setup of the story if you
6:39
don't know that then you might benefit more from stopping this video right now
6:44
or just watching it through and then coming back to watch my previous preptober videos about how to brainstorm
6:49
an idea and think of your idea for your book and that also walks you through how to choose which one is the right one for
6:55
you and then also my most recent one on World building and setting where I give you a worksheet that you can work
7:01
through um on Google Docs to go ahead and start thinking and brainstorming descriptions and setting and a little
7:08
bit about your world in terms of population and what uh locations this is
7:13
in what time this is in especially if you're writing in a genre where you know you're going to have to do a lot of
7:19
World building you might want to go through that video and that worksheet a little bit before you come to the outline but in some ways you could also
7:26
just start here and and reverse engineer Your World building after you're done but I'm going to assume right now that
7:33
you are coming to this video with an already an idea of who your main character is and what's the premise or
7:39
basic setup or conflict in this book and here's where I like to start is I will
Start With Big Picture
7:46
start with the big picture items so for me I tend to call this I've always
7:52
called this a threea structure cuz that's how I learned it but there are four parts and you know what recently I
7:57
was just like I'm just going to start calling this four act structure or four-part structure uh but in the past
8:03
I've always said act one act two part one act two part two and act three because that's the way I learned it but
8:09
I'm just kind of letting that go because I get tired of distinguishing between the act two before the midpoint and
8:14
after so I'm just going to call this four parts one two three and four and my story will be pretty
8:20
evenly distributed between these four parts except four part four is usually
8:26
the shortest part here and so I have down here at the
8:32
bottom I have the Act One climax this is also often called the doorway of no
8:37
return the first doorway then down here in act two we have What's called the midpoint of the novel then we have the
8:45
second doorway at the end of part three and then over here we have the climax
8:51
and resolution of the entire story so just understanding those broad Strokes
8:57
of the story so here we also have the open opening or hook and then we have the climax the Act One climax or the
9:03
first doorway I'll put them both here this is always how I start is I think
9:09
about what do I see in my head what do I know so far about this story that I could fill in these one two three four
9:17
five five to six basic broad Strokes so
9:22
I can do it here on an index card I could do it on a piece of paper or whatever but I would start to just
9:28
brainstorm what is possible that could happen in these slots the easiest part for me to
9:36
start with usually is what's the opening or hook of the story so for something
9:41
like this new story The Mirror um mirror of Shadows that I'm going to be working on for nanor rimo the opening Hook is
9:49
likely to be something where we see my main character stealing something so
9:55
she's a magical Thief she's a witch and part of the story is going to be her
10:03
being a thief for the order of Shadows and so we'll probably see her stealing something because the hook of the story
10:09
the opening scene of the story ideally is going to be something that hooks your reader in it doesn't have to be high
10:15
action but it needs to be something sort of genre specific that makes your reader
10:21
interested to read more it hooks them in it gets them interested in your story World your characters or the romance or
10:28
whatever is about your story so since uh disappearance of Vanessa Shaw for example is a murder mystery the first
10:35
scene in my book is the moment Vanessa disappears and so that leaves us on a hook of like oh my gosh what really just
10:41
happened to her so coming up with a hook for a scene I may not know anything more
10:47
at the beginning of this brainstorming process than what if I have an opening scene where she steals something and as
10:53
I go through this brainstorming process to start outlining I don't get too attached to any specific idea so if this
11:01
ends up not being the thing no big deal I just start a new note card or I could write this in pencil or just put it in a
11:06
document so I can easily erase and and type over it so don't get too attached
11:12
to every idea don't get stuck in the feeling that it has to be the perfect idea the first way through we're just
11:17
following a process of trial and error brainstorm get it out there see how it
11:22
feels move things around so let's say I know she's stealing something but the premise of this story is that in the
11:29
process of doing her job for the order of Shadows she has a rival person who
11:35
pushes her through a mirror and in that mirror she's stuck
11:40
similar to like an Alice and Wonderland sort of portal or Nar Narnia or something like that she gets stuck in
11:46
this Shadow World in this mirror world and so for me that is a natural Act One
11:52
climax the first doorway because it's a literal doorway into a new world so I would come over here and I would say
11:58
she's pushed through the mirror and my notes are going to be really sporadic here because I'm trying
12:04
to do them quickly for the video but so we start with her stealing something at the end of act one she gets pushed
12:10
through the mirror so then I can also go ahead and kind of fill in something here
12:15
that we have the introduction to the new world right like her reaction to it what
12:21
does it look like um description of it who are the people in it so I could go
12:27
ahead and start brainstorming the World building parts of it here description World building what's her
12:33
reaction who are the people here so I could make those notes because I know all of that's going to happen in this first part of the second act but then
12:41
I'm going to skip ahead and say okay then what happens at the midpoints the midpoint of a book is typically the this
12:48
changes everything moment it could be the moment when your characters first realize oh my gosh I'm actually falling
12:55
for this girl it could be sex um that these characters have sex for the first time it could be it doesn't have to be
13:01
obviously it just can be genre dependent it could be that we find a second body if it's a murder mystery now there's
13:07
another body and it was one of our Prime suspects um it could be that like if
13:13
she's here in this mirror world what could be the midpoint here so maybe at the midpoint she uh is challenged to a
13:22
duel to the death so we know that this is a dangerous world right so now I
13:27
could come and say well maybe let's say this is a dangerous world and she's got to fight for her life and then at the
13:33
midpoint she's challenged to a duel and she has to fight for her life and this changes everything
13:39
because she is now going to be put in danger but then you know we'll see if that is what sticks or not we're just
13:46
putting out ideas and seeing how it goes then we're going to have a second doorway where there's going to be another thing that shifts new
13:53
information comes to light a new battle they try try to make a new plan and make their final stand you know whatever it
13:59
is second doorway sometimes in a romance is that something happens between this
14:05
couple and new information comes to light and they break up or they have to have like a black moment kind of thing
14:12
where it's like they're not going to be able to be together something else happens in the story that breaks them up or pulls them apart in some way so then
14:19
we also have the climax and the resolution so what happens at the end of this story so she's stealing something
14:25
she gets pushed into this mirror world what could happen at the end of the story with a murder mystery like
14:31
disappearance of Vanessa Shaw there's a genre expectation of what happens at the end of the story with romance there's a
14:38
genre expectation that they're going to get together um with my Shadow Demon Saga there's a expectation in my series
14:46
that it's going to end whatever the main conflict was of this particular book but then there will also inside the
14:52
resolution be a new problem presented which is why my fans call them Sarah hangers because it'll be like oh it's
14:58
all wrapped up oh no it isn't this the world has now fallen apart again um so
15:04
what is the genre expectation of how your story will end and what can you go ahead and brainstorm that might possibly
15:10
happen in this story so I have not actually had any time to plot my mirror of Shadows so this is just all coming
15:16
off the top of my head real time but I I can see her getting pushed in the mirror potentially going through a lot of
15:22
trials and tribulations in this mirror world but to create a good climax of the
15:27
story I would love to have her um you know free free from the mirror
15:35
so somehow a battle or some kind of struggle that sets her free from the
15:41
mirror and then the resolution is what is her life like after that right what
15:47
um I already have some ideas but I don't want to put spoilers in there of like my little touch of the next Story coming in
Brainstorm
15:53
here once you have at least a few little things on this big Picture level of
16:00
opening midpoint doorway write down any other ideas of things that you know you
16:06
want to happen in the story so for me I might take another note card and just write brainstorm or something on it or
16:13
you could just do this anywhere and I'm going to say what else besides these moments do I think would be good for
16:21
this story like is there a subplot with a romance okay so I would just come in
16:27
and I would write down anything else that I know needs to happen in this story so for disappearance of Vanessa
16:34
Shaw it might be okay I know that I want to have some encounters where they think it might be Vanessa's ghost I also want
16:41
to have them following Clues to try to figure out what happened to Vanessa I don't have to get super specific about
16:47
each of those things I just need to go ahead and write them down and let my subconscious mind go ahead and be working on these story problems for
16:54
something like a mirror of Shadows I know that I want to have um different
17:00
characters have different abilities uh powerful abilities right
17:08
and I want them to all be different so something I know that I'm going to need to do is to Showcase those characters
17:14
introduce those characters and that's most likely to happen here in this sort of fun and games sort of area of act to
17:21
then we have some other things that I need to establish her normal life before
17:27
she goes into the mirror because we need to see her character Arc right so we need to see who she is at the beginning
17:33
of the story versus who she becomes by the end of it so I need to show her normal life before the
17:39
mirror I always have to have a romance in my books so it's just a necessity
17:45
even if it's not a romance novel there's always got to be a romance subplot so I know I want a romance maybe I don't have
17:52
any idea yet what I want it to be but maybe I know kind of the Trope is that I'd like to play around with an enemy to
17:58
lovers romance in this one so I might just start writing down all these things
18:03
that I already know about the character like I know I want to give her an ally inside the
18:09
mirror I know that I want some um some battle scenes maybe I have an idea for
18:17
um a potion shop inside the mirror and I could just write down all those things
18:22
that I know so far and when I start combining this idea with this maybe I
18:28
have some idea of where these things are going to come into the story so for example I might say here I know that I
18:34
need her normal life and I need to introduce the um the
18:41
antagonist that's going to send her through the mirror right um and maybe I
18:47
also want to um sort of show her magic a little bit these aren't specific scenes
18:53
they're just things I know I want to happen in the story then I might say okay okay well here in the new world so
19:00
I need to introduce the love interest then I need to introduce the new
19:06
character so that's like the the people and maybe I could make a note to say I want to showcase their powers if you
19:13
were writing let's say A Space Opera or something like that you might have the
19:18
beginning you know genre wise is going to be like them loading up the ship and heading on a new adventure or something
19:24
and then something goes wrong in act one that puts them into the story right it puts them into the
19:30
premise maybe it's that they uh discover a new land or maybe they get into some
19:36
kind of meteor shower and their sh ship gets messed up and they have to land on this foreign planet that would be the
19:42
act one it's like what's the first big problem that comes up for these characters and then how do we introduce
19:49
the new world that they're put into could be actually literally a new world like it will be with my shadow story or
19:56
it could be a new world in that okay I met this guy I had sworn off love he
20:02
kissed me or I just found out he's my new boss boom now what is the new world
20:07
now I have to work this job where there's all this tension between us that's all the stuff that goes in here
20:12
so just start brainstorming bullet points of scenes that you could see happening between your characters or as
20:18
they find their bearings here and then boom once we get to this midpoint we need another shift so we have our first
20:25
shift here at the at the end of act one we need another shift here at the end of act two where we say everything changes
20:34
right so maybe in your space like Alien Invasion story or whatever it might be your sci-fi story maybe Everything
20:41
Changes is something you could brainstorm like what's another conflict that could come up that they thought
20:46
they were alone on this planet but in the midpoint they realized that they actually landed on a planet they're
20:52
familiar with that has an entire race of uh people that hate humans like there
20:58
could be anything there but like something's got to happen at this midpoint that changes everything and
21:04
even as I'm talking through it let's say in this new world everyone says there's no way out of the mirror but maybe at
21:11
the midpoint she discovers instead of being challenged to a duel maybe she discovers that there's a way
21:18
out that if she were to cast this spell on midnight at the such and such
21:24
whatever she could actually break the mirror spell and she finds this um this book that explains what she
21:30
needs to do but there's a conflict as to why she can't do it so then I would want to explore that conflict here in the
21:38
third part and that's going to lead me down to the second doorway where let's say she's getting ready to cast this
21:45
spell but someone does something terrible and they like ruin the one
21:53
piece of of the spell like the crystal gets broken and now she can't cast the
21:58
spell anymore so all her hopes are dashed and now we've got her with a Race Against Time to try to repair the
22:05
crystal before the sunsets on the third day like I don't know I'm just throwing stuff out there but you would just think
22:12
through what are the major twists and turns that could happen and of course it really greatly depends on what genre
22:18
you're writing as to what type of twist and turn these moments in your story are going to be is it going to be romance
22:25
then each one of these little points needs to have to do with your Romance the first time they kiss first time they
22:30
have sex when they break up when they get back together like it could be that simple right um if it's a science
22:38
fiction story it's it's their first doorway their first sense of real trouble then the exploration then
22:44
another big conflict comes along then the final big conflict comes along that they have to face and overcome in this
22:50
last part like their final plan their final hope of seeing it all through so
22:56
think about your genre and just start exploring once you have as much of this down as you can I highly recommend
23:04
taking a moment and doing a bit of a mind map with each of the pieces that you have in place because at this point
23:11
you might have lots of little dots filled in but they might not be specific
23:16
and they might not be fleshed out now for some people as I said in the intro you don't need to flesh this out maybe
23:23
this is more than enough and you just have a note card that has some bullet points on it and you just start writing and you're all good to go maybe you
23:29
spend a little bit of time with your world building like we did last week's video and then you just are ready to
23:34
start writing for Nano for other people you might want to go ahead and have this all filled out on note cards the way
23:41
that I do so it's really up to you how deep you want to go in this process and
23:47
I would really highly encourage you to use your intuition with that that if you think okay do I feel excited and ready
23:53
to write or do I want to figure out a little bit more of this story and just go to the point where it feels continues
23:59
to feel good to you cuz for some of us you're just going to discover these pieces in the writing but let me keep
Mindmap Each Part
24:06
going for those of you that want to keep going so I would continue to mind map so
24:11
then we're going to break it down remember how I said that trip to New York City right I don't have to like
24:16
these are my places I'm going to spend the night along the way but now I'm going to try to actually figure out what's my route for day one of this trip
24:24
so I might come in here and uh let me think how best really do this like I might come up here and I might just put
24:31
act one and then I'll say something like um the first thing that happens is she's
24:39
stealing a crystal and that's the first thing we see from the character is she stealing a crystal and I know that
24:45
somehow I want to get her to this act one climax or the first doorway of being
24:52
pushed into the mirror but I have to figure out all the things that happen in between and and I
24:57
have a few ideas about her normal life and the antagonist and showing her magic so I'm going to go ahead and and pull
25:04
those out in little pieces over here so I might say okay who's who's the
25:09
antagonist this might not actually even be the right word for her because we're not going to see her in the mirror world
25:14
but she's kind of the Catalyst person um who's the girl that pushes her through the mirror right who is that then I
25:21
might have a question and I can Circle that over here and then I might have a question over here of normal life and
25:27
then I put over here uh MC's magic so these are all the little pieces that I
25:33
pulled from here and now I'm just putting them out on a mind map sort of uh page and then I can just start
25:40
brainstorming and it like I said it doesn't have to be attached to any idea just open your mind up and say what
25:46
would be kind of fun for her magic what kind of magic do I want her to have well I know she's a thief so let's say she
25:51
can go invisible she can pick locks she can um she has in infite Pockets that
25:58
would be kind of cool and I could just start writing down different forms of her magic what is her normal life okay
26:04
so she's an orphan she lives at a ruby prima's house and I could just start
26:12
writing down the things I know about her normal life what do I know about this antagonist that pushes her through the mirror what would be some fun things and
26:18
as I go I can just start circling the ideas that I like best then I can start thinking okay with all of these pieces
Putting It All Together
26:26
in place how do I start telling this as a story and this is where we're either
26:32
going to come to my working outline sheet or you're going to start actually
26:38
giving yourself bullet points right so again I'm just using these big note
26:43
cards cuz I like them and you could brainstorm scenes here too so you could say okay here's her normal life let's
26:48
talk about a scene that would happen in her normal showing her normal life and you could write out what happens in this
26:54
scene what's a scene where we see her using her magic magic well the thief scene is where we're going to see her
27:00
using her magic for the first time but where does she encounter the antagonist and start thinking of these things that
27:05
you already had in bullet points as scenes now we're going to go in here and
27:11
we're going to make a like a little act one or part one note
27:17
card and we can start just doing Simple scen bullet points and sometimes the way
27:26
that I like to do this is l Lally just stepping My Mind through the story now
27:31
for those of you that are familiar with threea structure or different plotting methods that have Beats this is where
27:38
you're going to start to work through the Beats of your story going from the beginning of act one to the climax of
27:43
act one now if you wanted some books to read up on Jessica Brody has a book
27:48
based on Blake KN Blake Snider's screenwriting book called uh save the cat and this is called save the cat
27:54
writes a novel and she specifically goes through different story beats that you
27:59
have in a lot of stories so you've got the opening image the setup the theme
28:05
the Catalyst the debate the break into two the funing games and so on and so this will walk you through it if you
28:12
understand those beats you can use her beats there's also if you're writing a romance Gwen Hayes has a book called Romancing the beat I will link all that
28:18
below I tend to follow just a typical like hero's journey or I'm studying more
28:24
on the heroin's journey as well in a threea structure which like I said I'm now calling a four-part structure and
28:30
that's what I've walked you through in your preptober planner and again you can get this for free just sign up for my newsletter list down below and I will
28:36
send you a link to my resource Library where you can download it but I will start with okay what's the
28:44
hook of the story what's that opening scene and I will write out everything I figured out in my brainstorming and then
28:52
I might come down here and say this is the act one climax where she gets pushed through the the mirror right and then
28:59
I'll start either way I can back up like what happens right before she gets
29:04
pushed in the mirror and I can reverse engineer some of this stuff and I can also work my way forward I can also work
29:11
in any of the things that I saw here that I know are scenes that I want to get introduced in this part so at some
29:17
point we need to meet this antagonist and she needs to push her through the mirror but maybe we just see the antagonist here um like antagonist or
29:26
Catalyst whatever you want to call it confronts her at the Ruby house and so I
29:31
can write down anything I know about that scene and then at the climax of that scene she pushes her through the mirror at the hook we have her in a
29:38
warehouse stealing a crystal so what might happen next okay once she I and I
29:44
just literally will walk myself through the story of like what's the lot next logical thing that might happen she's
29:49
stolen the crystal where does she take it if she's stolen it for the order she's going to take it back to her
29:56
Handler or or whatever whoever requested the crystal so I might have a scene there where she
30:03
takes it back then I might have her go to high school like maybe this is her me showing her normal life remember I had
30:09
this part where I was like I got to show her normal life so maybe she spent her whole night and morning working on this
30:15
Crystal and now she has to go to high school and pretend to be just a normal girl or maybe I'm going to put her in college and I can start brainstorming
30:22
that college scene where I show her normal life and then I can just try to
30:27
conect the dots based on how long I want this act to be and so I might say like
30:33
um okay we've got the antagonist that confronts her at the Ruby house what else could happen in between this That
Story Beats
30:39
Could set things up for what's happening later in my story and I would just continue to look at those beats if I get
30:46
stuck here and I'm not sure what happens in the middle then I'm going to come to these actual story beats and I'm going to start filling them out so for example
30:53
main character the beginning this is going to be my hook their normal world this will be the scene of her at college
30:59
and then opening scene how does it how does it hook the reader in so actually
31:04
this is not the hook when I say main character at the beginning I mean like what's her emotional state at the beginning so from this character in my
31:11
mirror story it's very much like her emotional state is that she's trapped here um that she doesn't have any
31:18
Independence that she's going to be basically a Workhorse for the order of Shadows her whole life but she never is
31:23
going to be let into the order and so she's feeling hopeless she feels trapped she feels like she has no control or
31:30
agency in her life then I show her normal world where that emotional side of her is actually shown in scenes then
31:37
the hook is that she's going to steal this Crystal right so I can write everything that I know about that but
31:42
then the dramatic question of this story is what now because she's going to get
31:48
moved and pushed into this mirror I need to think about what's happening later in the story so the dramatic question might
31:54
be something like will she ever break free of the order or the control that other
32:02
people have on her will she ever be strong enough to break free of of other people's control how does she feel about
32:08
the conflict or the disturbance at first so the disturbance is the stealing of this Crystal and maybe you know what's
32:14
going on here that's usually the conflict or the disturbance going on here or I could say how does she feel
32:20
about this idea that she's not free and I can just Riff on that a little bit the inciting incident is something that
32:26
typically happens um you know in a bit into the story but it can also be something that happens before the story
32:33
so for example in disappearance of Vanessa Shaw the inciting incident is Vanessa's disappearance which happens in
32:39
the prologue but sometimes the inciting incident doesn't happen until later in the story as is the case here the
32:46
inciting incident is that she's going to be all of this inciting incident and key
32:52
event all happen kind of together where she's going to get pushed into the mirror
32:57
and I will sort of caveat this by saying I'm writing this book as a serial so I
33:03
will actually go through a slightly different plotting process because this is going to be broken into pieces um and
33:08
I won't structure it exactly like I would a novel so if you're interested in seeing how I'm going to structure the serialized story let me know and I will
33:15
do that but right now we're kind of focusing on novels but basically that process is what I will go through with
33:22
every single act so I will take the overview of the story and any scenes I
33:27
could imagine there and I will go through act one act two act three act four and I will just step through okay
33:34
now that we're in act two and she's in this mirror world what are the scenes what needs to happen next to get her to
33:40
this point where she discovers in the library a way to escape from this mirror
33:46
and I already know quite a bit about her reaction to getting into the mirror and what all is going to happen here in The
33:52
Disappearance of Vanessa sha the first doorway is that they also get stuck or trapped on this River and they in this
33:59
cabin and they think the Killer is there and they're all in danger potentially Vanessa's ghost as well is part of the
34:06
story so all of this that happens at the first part of act two is a reaction to
34:11
this first doorway and so this for me tends to be an easy place to write but
34:16
then sometimes I get stuck trying to figure out what else happens leading to this way and so I will just follow that same process
34:23
of writing out a bunch of bullet points you can start with maybe like eight scenes let's say we're going to start
34:29
with eight to 10 scenes per act or per part and just start reverse engineering and filling in the blanks of anything
34:36
you see so far and get as specific as you can but don't worry if you can't get too specific then come into my plotting
34:44
sheets here I'm not going to walk you through all of this but if you would like to know a little bit more about these beats then I will also link my how
34:50
to Plot a novel series I will be redoing that entire Series in 2024 which I know
34:55
many of you have request Ed so there will be more coming up on the plotting part but I do kind of walk you through
35:01
some of these questions like how do these like what challenges come up next how these challenges make her grow or see the world differently what happens
35:08
at the midpoint what's happens at the mirror moment and if you watch that series on plotting you will see um what
35:13
I'm talking about with the mirror moment another thing that I do like to do speaking of the mirror moment when I'm
35:19
brainstorming my plot is I will create this little triangle here where I say
35:24
who is my character at the beginning of the story and this is sort of a character Arc thing which we'll get into more later who is she at the beginning
35:31
of the story and then who does she need to become in order to fulfill the end of
35:37
this story question right in a romance it's like how does this girl who has her heart closed off from love come to fall
35:44
in love and truly give herself to this person right something along those lines there's always that character Arc now
35:50
you might be writing like a detective mystery where there's not much of a character Arc so you may not need this but this can be another tool where you
35:56
say here's where they are at the beginning here's who they become at the end and then we take a look at the middle of the book where James Scott
36:02
Bell says there is usually a mirror moment which is a moment of like who have I become I must change or I'm going
36:10
to die it can also be a moment of the odds against me are too great which if I stuck with the idea of her being
36:15
challenged to a duel um in my mirror story she might be like the odds against me are too great I'm probably going to
36:21
die here but I'm going to go down fighting and then throughout the rest of the course of the book she becomes so
36:27
strong that she finds a way out so sometimes figuring out your character's
36:32
Arc can also make you think oh I need a scene where she learns this new type of magic so where's that going to go and
36:38
then you can go back to your little story line here and say okay this is
36:44
where her magic is going to grow a little bit I know this looks a little bit chaotic but for me the back and
Summary Of Outlining
36:52
forth of what can I figure out along the way starting with the big sort of tent
36:58
poles of the story the things that hold up the story the biggest turning points of the story emotionally and you know
37:04
plot-wise can I figure those out and then can I re reverse engineer and kind of work my way
37:11
backward and forward using any scenes that I knew or anything I know I want to
37:17
happen so for example a subplot in this story is going to be a romance so I can
37:22
separately go out here and create another mind map to say who is this
37:29
romance going to be here's the one I was using who is this romance going to be I could start a whole new mind map here
37:34
and say romance and I could say Okay I want it to be enemies to lovers but this
37:40
but this but this and I can start mind mapping and coming up with different scenes that might be possibilities and
37:45
the more I can open my mind instead of feeling like I have to have it figured out perfectly right from the start the
37:50
better off it's going to be and sometimes if you're following a really strict structure like a romance novels
37:57
sometimes have pretty like strict structure in terms of the different things that readers are expecting
38:03
especially if you're following certain troopes that it might be easier to find your way to these scenes with some
38:09
things like literary fiction or more complex like multiple POV novels you might not have as easy of a time
38:15
figuring out each individual beat so that's why I've given you this sort of road map to figuring out the beats and
38:21
then understand that as you're writing you just need to be thinking what what's
38:26
the next logical thing that could happen that could impact this story and how would my character knowing what I know
38:33
about them react or respond what would be the next thing they would do and just walk your way through the story like
38:40
that I hope this has been helpful I know this again is a longer video but by the
38:45
time I typically am ready to write I will have all of these things figured
38:51
out for myself now you can see kind of um my desk is chaos here here as well
38:57
but for like The Disappearance of Vanessa Shaw for example I will have like this is act one and I will have it
39:04
mapped out according to the plot Which chapter what's happening in the scene what's the conflict of this scene what's
39:11
the purpose of the scene like the goal of this scene and then how many words did it take me to write that and this
39:18
type of thing really helps me in terms of keeping on track now I don't always know this before I start writing I'll
39:24
just have pieces of it just like we did in that note card and then I will gradually fill it out as I go because as
39:31
you write you're going to start having light bulb moments and ideas now we will have a video later about what happens if
39:37
you get stuck that you've written the First Act but now you can't figure out what happens in act two but hopefully some of this will help you another way
39:44
that I like to organize my notes because I'm very much a paper plotter kind of person is I will either take my note
39:51
cards and put them on just take like a little um hole punch and I will punch
39:56
them and put them on one of these like book rings that you can get on Amazon just like this to keep them all in order
40:03
or I also have this cool little thing that I've been using lately where you can slip them into sleeves and then you
40:09
can just kind of page through it like a book and I have been enjoying this because I get a bigger view than just
40:14
one note card at a time but on my note cards I like to put the basic premise of
40:20
the scene my character's goal in the scene the conflict of the scene and the outcome how does it turn out and then
40:26
any notes that I might have about that scene and the way way this helps me is if I can identify what my character
40:33
wants to achieve in this scene and what their conflict is going to be and then how that conflict leads to an outcome
40:39
they didn't expect I can usually say okay so now that she's realizing how alone she is and how bad she feels what
40:45
would she do next maybe she runs off to her room and she has a good cry you know or something like that or maybe she runs
40:51
to a friend and that's where the stuff like the Mind mapping or sitting down with a friend and saying what could could happen next here's what I've got
40:57
so far in the story and just start bouncing ideas off each other well what if she did this what if she did this
41:02
what if she did this and sometimes that can help me when I'm feeling stuck is I'll say here's the outcome of the scene
41:08
and here's what's happened so far and then I'll just jot down a list of like set a timer for 10 minutes and jot down
41:13
a list of what's 10 more things that could happen and keep in mind what's the next big story point that happens so
41:21
like at some point they're going to have a storm and they're going to get trapped here or at some point she's going to get pushed through this mirror so what needs
41:27
to happen before that and in the context of that what are 10 things that could potentially happen and eventually you
41:35
just make a choice and you write it and it feels right or it doesn't and if it doesn't feel right you write something different and that is the process of
41:42
being a writer and I think sometimes where people get really stuck is that they feel like it has to be right or
41:47
perfect the very first time you do it but the truth is you have all these pieces of paper all these chances as
41:54
much as you want to be able to take it and try new things and brainstorm new scenes but I know that for nanoro
42:01
specifically we really want to try to have as much of it figured out as we individually need in order to keep
42:08
moving forward so I do have lots of resources in this preptober planner for
42:13
you to continue to expand on what we've done today so you've got this full four-page outline that will walk you all
42:20
the way through to the very climax of the story and it even is going to inform Your World building as well as your
42:27
character Arc then I also have an explanation on how to then take that and write scene by
42:35
scene and I explained to you how I created these scene cards and this brainstorming scene process to reflect
42:41
on what just happened determine how to best transition from this scene to this scene and it walks you through these
42:47
steps I do also have a series here on YouTube about how to write your book from scenes so I will link all of that
42:54
for you below if you just want to keep watching and that is all of the sort of brainstorming stuff that I have for you
43:00
and I hope that this is super helpful please let me know in the comments if there's anything that you want me to expand on or that doesn't work for you
43:08
or a place that you've tried all these steps and you're still getting stuck let me know and I am here to help as much as
43:13
I can but eventually there comes a point where you just have to try and be willing to for it to not be the right
43:20
thing and then try something different and then try something different and just never give up okay we did it that's
Final Thoughts
43:27
it for our nanoro outlining video our preptober outlining video I hope this
43:33
was helpful I hope something here really resonated with you I love talking about plotting because it is such a great tool
43:39
for keeping your story cohesive for making sure that your story and your characters are telling the story that
43:45
you want they have the theme and the meanings that you wanted to put into it and it's also something that you can
43:51
always turn to when you feel like you're stuck but like I said do it your way so let me know in the comments are you a
43:58
plot plotter are you a pancer traditionally and you're just watching this video looking for a little bit of
44:03

I

writing multiple POV novels is one of my
0:03
passions in life I absolutely love it
0:06
and I have multiple books that have lots
0:10
of different povs including this series
0:12
The Eternal Sorrows series which has
0:15
seven main points of view and sometimes
0:17
an eighth POV I love it it is so much
0:20
fun to be able to show your story from
0:23
multiple perspectives but I know that
0:26
writing in multiple POV can often feel a
0:28
little bit overwhelming and a little bit
0:30
daunting so today I'm going to give you
0:32
nine great tips for how to write
0:35
multiple POV and then I'm going to
0:37
actually show you how I am currently
0:39
organizing my novel The Disappearance of
0:42
Vanessa Shaw which has eight points of
0:44
view so let's get started
0:50
before we go over the tips on how to
0:53
write multiple POV it's important to
0:55
understand what multiple POV actually is
0:58
so POV stands for point of view and when
1:02
we're talking about a character's point
1:04
of view we're not just talking about
1:06
they appear in dialogue or we see them
1:08
through the main character's eyes what
1:10
we're talking about when we say POV is
1:12
that we are actually telling a piece of
1:15
the story from that person's perspective
1:17
as if the reader is inside that person's
1:19
head or is following that person very
1:22
closely so when you have a point of view
1:24
it means we're hearing their thoughts
1:26
we're seeing everything they're doing
1:27
and we're seeing the world through this
1:29
person's eyes so this can be anywhere
1:32
from two points of view in a story to
1:35
dozens if some fantasy novels will
1:38
sometimes have an omniscient point of
1:40
view or an omniscient narrator or they
1:43
will do a third person limited with
1:45
multiple characters sometimes as many as
1:47
a dozen or more and I know that that can
1:50
feel a little bit overwhelming how do
1:52
you even structure a story when it comes
1:54
to this so let's get into these tips
Know Why
1:57
first is to know why you're doing it
2:00
obviously any story is going to have
2:03
multiple characters in it but why do we
2:07
need to see what's inside this person's
2:09
head and this person's perspective why
2:11
do we need to get this person's voice
2:13
this person's knowledge why does this
2:16
particular character deserve to have
2:19
their own part of the story told there's
2:22
lots of reasons behind this it could be
2:24
that this particular character has
2:26
secrets that other people don't know it
2:28
could be that this character or multiple
2:30
characters are split up throughout the
2:32
story and you can't tell the full story
2:33
just from one person's point of view
2:35
there are lots of different reasons that
2:37
we might see this it might be to add
2:39
tension to the story to add Dimension to
2:41
the story to add different perspectives
2:43
or diversity to your story but make sure
2:46
that you have a reason other than just
2:48
you know we've got this one main
2:49
character and then you've got a bunch of
2:51
Side characters that just add flavor to
2:53
the story it really needs to go deeper
2:54
than that where each character has an
2:57
arc they have a reason they have a
2:59
personality and something distinct about
3:01
them that is adding to the story just to
3:03
give it an example of this really
3:05
quickly in my series The Shadow Demon
3:07
Saga I started out with a single point
3:09
of view Harper is the main character and
3:12
the only point of view character in the
3:14
first six books which means that
3:16
everything we see in this story is stuff
3:18
that Harper knows and has experienced so
3:22
we can't see or know anything that she
3:24
hasn't experienced because that's the
3:26
limit that we see when we are going
3:28
through a limited point of view
3:31
when I got to the sixth book and there
3:34
was a bigger battle and the world had
3:35
expanded I realized that I was holding
3:38
myself back as this world became more of
3:40
a fantasy world this is really a portal
3:42
fantasy in essence and I realized it was
3:46
limiting myself and my way of telling
3:48
that story so I decided once we get to
3:51
book Seven to do something a little bit
3:53
unorthodox but that's the beauty of
3:55
being an indie author I can make those
3:57
kinds of creative decisions I split it
4:00
out into four different points of view
4:02
so in book six through right now 11
4:06
gonna be working on the final book 12
4:08
soon you do get more points of view and
4:11
it is four main points of view and even
4:13
sometimes I do split out to A fifth or
4:15
sixth point of view in some of the
4:17
stories and that allows my world to be
4:19
so much richer because I can have
4:21
Jackson in one location that Harper's
4:23
not there and we as readers can still
4:25
see what's happening because when we're
4:27
limited to Harper's Point of View we
4:29
can't possibly know what Jackson's doing
4:31
on the the other side of the world or in
4:33
a shadow World unless they were
4:35
communicating in some way so this way it
4:37
allows me to add more depth to the world
4:39
and more plot and beefier steaks and all
4:42
kinds of stuff so I am a big fan of
4:44
multiple POV you just need to think
4:46
about what am I trying to achieve by
4:48
showing this story from multiple
4:50
perspectives tip number two is that it
One Per Chapter
4:53
is usually best to write each chapter
4:56
from a single point of view you will see
4:59
sometimes that you'll have maybe a page
5:02
break or something and then or a scene
5:04
break and then you'll switch POV Stephen
5:06
King sometimes does this so you will see
5:09
this done well but for the most part it
5:11
is easier on readers when we say this
5:14
chapter is this person's point of view
5:15
which allows us to Anchor that chapter
5:18
into that person's head or that person's
5:20
thought or experiences without head
5:22
hopping one of the biggest mistakes that
5:25
you will see authors making when it
5:27
comes to multiple POV is that they'll be
5:30
really anchored into to a certain
5:32
character's perspective and will hear
5:34
their thoughts and will be in a close or
5:36
limited point of view with them and all
5:39
of a sudden we'll also hear Jackson's
5:41
thoughts and then Jackson will start to
5:43
take over the scene and this is called
5:44
Head hopping where you really are
5:47
getting almost Whiplash from whose point
5:49
of view are we actually in because if
5:51
we're in let's say Harper's Point of
5:53
View she can't hear what Jackson's
5:55
thinking and so when the narrator tells
5:58
us what Jackson's thinking it's a bit of
6:01
a cheat or it's a bit of a head hop and
6:03
there is omniscient point of view and
6:05
we're going to get into tense in just a
6:06
minute but when you are writing in some
6:09
kind of close or limited point of view
6:11
then you need to make sure that you're
6:12
anchoring each chapter or at least each
6:15
section of a chapter each scene in one
6:18
single person's point of view so that
6:20
you're not confusing your reader or
6:21
you're not giving them Whiplash because
6:23
they're hearing this person's thoughts
6:25
but then this person readers like to
6:27
know whose head they're in whose eyes
6:29
they're seeing the story through
6:31
so make sure that you try to keep at
6:33
least at the very least each scene to
6:35
one person's point of view or what I
6:37
prefer to do is to write each chapter
6:39
from one single point of view tip number
Stay Consistent
6:42
three does address this idea of tense
6:45
and what perspective you're telling the
6:48
story from and I could make an entire
6:50
series on this so if I'm going a little
6:52
bit fast feel free to ask questions down
6:54
in the comments but when we are writing
6:57
multiple POV a lot of times what readers
7:00
like to see is a limited point of view
7:03
now you will see a lot of books such as
7:06
the Harry Potter series or multiple
7:08
fantasy series where you have an
7:10
omniscient narrator meaning that the
7:13
omniscient narrator knows everything
7:15
they can see each individual character's
7:17
thoughts they can see the story from
7:19
anyone's perspective they can come out
7:21
and see this Eagle eye view of what's
7:23
Happening across the entire world or
7:24
universe that is an omniscient narrator
7:27
then you will also see a third person
7:30
limited point of view or perspective
7:32
where the narrative narrator can only
7:34
see what this one character is thinking
7:37
this is the type of writing that I like
7:39
to do where I don't usually write
7:41
omniscient I usually write from a
7:44
limited POV so for example my eternal
7:47
sorrow Series has multiple points of
7:49
view each chapter is in a different
7:52
person's point of view and is actually
7:54
labeled with the character's name so
7:56
we'll get into that in another tip and
7:58
then it's in third person so it's third
8:01
person past tense but it's a limited
8:04
tense meaning when we are in a chapter
8:06
that features crash all we can see and
8:08
hear is what crash sees and hears when
8:12
you have an omniscient narrator they can
8:14
see what all the characters are thinking
8:16
but it's not always the best case
8:18
scenario to keep your story high level
8:21
like that where you've got an omniscient
8:23
narrator that can hear everyone's
8:25
thoughts because like I said in the
8:26
previous tip readers like to be anchored
8:30
in someone's eyes or someone's point of
8:31
view so when you get really good at
8:33
writing this scare to be honest this
8:35
type of writing scares me a little bit
8:37
but it is pretty common in fantasy
8:39
writing you will see a beginning of a
8:42
chapter start out a little bit more
8:44
omniscient and then we'll kind of zero
8:46
into a more limited point of view if you
8:49
want to see more videos and examples of
8:51
this I'll be happy to make more videos
8:53
but I think one of the most important
8:55
things you can do is to decide which
8:58
perspective you're telling your story
9:00
from is it going to be first person past
9:03
tense with a limited POV like my Shadow
9:05
Demon Saga where each chapter is
9:07
different character's perspective and
9:09
it's told in the first person like I saw
9:12
this I said this or is it going to be
9:15
third person limited perspective where
9:17
you say she said this Harper walked
9:20
across the room and we're a little bit
9:22
separated from the character's head and
9:24
we're in third person or are you gonna
9:26
mix it up a little bit so sometimes in
9:29
some books especially you'll see this in
9:31
like murder mysteries or detective
9:33
Mysteries you may have the detective in
9:36
first person past tense with a very
9:38
limited perspective where we're just
9:40
seeing things through the detective's
9:41
eyes but then the villain or the killer
9:45
might be in third person or the killer
9:48
might be in second person even that is
9:51
really unusual but it's interesting to
9:54
see that so some chapters are in
9:56
different types of perspectives and that
9:59
can be a good choice to make but just be
10:03
aware again of why you're doing it and
10:05
what is the effect that you're trying to
10:07
achieve let every single Choice here be
10:10
intentional and have a reason behind it
10:12
whether you're trying to affect the tone
10:14
trying to affect the storytelling give
10:17
it some thought and try to decide which
10:19
perspective you're going to be in and
10:21
which tense you're going to be in and
10:23
then make sure that you're consistent
10:24
with that throughout the entire book so
10:27
for example simple you wouldn't want to
10:29
have your village chapters in third
10:31
person and then all of a sudden do a
10:33
villain chapter in first person you
10:34
would want to stay consistent with those
10:36
choices throughout the entire book which
Whose Head?
10:38
leads us to the fourth tip which is to
10:40
be very clear whose head we're in at the
10:43
beginning of the chapter when a reader
10:46
turns the page to a brand new chapter
10:48
they will still be in the mindset and in
10:51
the eyes of the person they were just in
10:54
so if chapter two is in Harper's Point
10:55
of View their mind is going to be
10:57
calibrated to Harper's personality and
10:59
her thoughts and what she's been going
11:01
through what situation we're leaving her
11:03
in so when they turn the page to chapter
11:05
three they're already going to be
11:07
predisposed to think in Harper's Point
11:10
of View so if you're switching we need
11:12
to be really clear about who we're
11:14
switching to and what situation they're
11:16
currently in where are they what's the
11:18
timeline here and anchor that in right
11:21
away so what I like to do there is the
11:23
second you turn the page you've got not
11:26
only the title of the chapter but you
11:28
have the name of the protagonist here so
11:30
you turn the chapter you see that it's
11:32
Jackson and this is pretty common to
11:34
name the chapter or to head the chapter
11:37
with the character's name you don't
11:39
always have to do that I mentioned
11:41
Stephen King earlier if you've ever read
11:42
some of his Ensemble casts like my
11:44
favorite the stand or Under the Dome or
11:47
it you'll notice that even though he's
11:49
changing point of view quite often he
11:52
does anchor us into that character
11:54
pretty quickly so he's usually writing
11:56
third person close or limited point of
11:58
view and he'll just name the character
12:00
he'll say something like you know
12:02
Jackson hunt walked across the lonely
12:05
highway so that we know not only what
12:08
we're seeing in our head
12:10
but also who we're seeing or who is
12:13
talking here and this is super important
12:15
to get your reader to actually like your
12:18
multiple POV story it's crucial that the
12:22
reader turns the page and with every
12:24
single switch you anchor them into who
12:27
is speaking and what is going on with
12:29
that character visually so that they can
12:32
immediately begin to see it so many
12:34
characters experience our books like
12:36
movies running through their head and so
12:38
if we don't tell them where they are and
12:40
give them a visual of who it is and what
12:43
situation they're in right now it can
12:45
really confuse the reader tip number
12:47
five is to make each voice unique which
Each Character Distinct
12:51
doesn't have to actually be over the top
12:53
but to give each character really
12:56
distinct characteristics distinct things
12:59
that they always say or that they're
13:01
thinking about distinct ways of speaking
13:04
so that we always can tell even if you
13:07
didn't give us a name who we're seeing
13:09
the story through right right now so
13:11
giving your character some kind of Quirk
13:14
giving them a specific voice so you
13:16
might have particularly in a romance
13:18
let's say you might have grumpy Sunshine
13:21
Trope so every time we're in that guy's
13:24
point of view and he's grumpy we're
13:25
gonna get a harsher rougher way of
13:28
thinking a more negative way or that
13:31
type of perspective whereas if we're in
13:33
the female Sunshine happy point of view
13:36
she's always going to be looking on the
13:37
positive side of things and the way she
13:39
speaks in her own mind will naturally
13:42
sound very different and so giving your
13:44
characters a particular and distinct
13:46
voice can be also very important in
13:49
making sure that we're anchoring the
13:50
reader in the feel and tone and style of
13:53
that character tip number six is to
One Main Character
13:57
consider focusing on one main character
14:01
so a lot of times when we have an
14:03
ensemble cast you will see that each
14:06
individual character has their own
14:08
personality and they're very distinct
14:10
but usually there's one main character
14:13
and it's often the character we meet
14:15
first that the main part of the story is
14:17
intro you know introduced so if you
14:19
think about The Walking Dead it's Rick
14:21
like Rick is the main character of that
14:23
series and even though we often are in
14:26
Michonne's point of view or we're in
14:28
Daryl's point of view and we get to see
14:29
their stories and their backstories Rick
14:31
is the main character he's the main dude
14:33
right and we see so many of the turning
14:36
points of the story the beginnings and
14:38
the ends of series or Seasons fall on
14:40
this one character who is the main hero
14:43
of the story and a lot of times this is
14:45
another way to Anchor readers into the
14:47
actual plot of the story The Wheel of
14:50
Time for example is one of my favorite
14:51
series of all time there are dozens of
14:55
point of view characters throughout that
14:56
entire series but we all know that Rand
14:59
is the main character and that is the
15:01
person that we see not necessarily first
15:03
in the story but he's the first one that
15:05
we really get his deep close perspective
15:08
and that's often how we anchor readers
15:10
into our story in my eternal sorrow
15:12
series it's perish in my demon series
15:15
it's Harper and everybody kind of is
15:17
able to know that when Harper is on
15:19
screen it's really her story they're
15:21
most emotionally connected with and even
15:24
though you may have other characters
15:25
that you begin to love you do sort of
15:27
see that story in the stand it's Stu
15:30
Redmond we see him as one of the first
15:33
people to encounter the virus in the
15:35
stand and we follow him throughout and
15:37
it's his story we're most anchored into
15:38
but Franny is my favorite character so
15:41
you give people those different
15:43
perspectives but you anchor the plot
15:45
line with one main character this is not
15:47
always true for romances though for
15:49
those of you that are romance authors
15:52
you know that really both main
15:53
characters if you're telling dual POV
15:55
there with romances have their own full
15:57
story arc and their fully fleshed out
16:00
characters so that's one way that
16:01
romance can differ in multiple POV from
16:04
an ensemble cast but the seventh tip is
Don't Need To Alternate
16:07
to not feel like you have to all
16:10
alternate every single chapter so if you
16:13
had four points of view you don't have
16:15
to feel like each chapter goes one two
16:17
three four one two three four in a round
16:19
robin style and this is one of the
16:21
biggest mistakes I will see people make
16:23
right from the start is that they feel
16:25
they have to keep it balanced there's 10
16:27
chapters in each person's point of view
16:29
or five chapters in each and we have to
16:31
go alternating and you don't even have
16:33
to do this in Romance where you have
16:35
maybe two points of view it doesn't have
16:37
to be you know female male female male
16:39
or you know whatever type of romance
16:41
you're writing male male whatever but it
16:44
doesn't have to alternate that way
16:46
sometimes it makes more sense for us to
16:48
see this particular character number one
16:51
going through three different
16:53
experiences before we move on to
16:55
character number two so don't feel like
16:58
hindered by this idea that you have to
17:01
alternate or you have to keep them
17:03
balanced remember that I was just
17:04
talking about there often is that one
17:06
main character
17:07
and sometimes we will see that main
17:10
character in more scenes than we will
17:12
anyone else in the will of time for
17:14
example in that very first book The Eye
17:16
Of The World Rand is by far the
17:18
character we're in his head the most
17:20
that isn't always true of later books
17:23
and in fact there is a later book in the
17:24
series where I don't think we even get
17:26
rand's point of view at all even though
17:28
he's really the main hero of the story
17:30
we see him the most in that first book
17:33
because the author is really trying to
17:35
Anchor the story in rand's point of view
17:38
Rand story he's setting him up as the
17:40
hero and we won't go into a game of A
17:44
Song of Ice and Fire Game of Thrones
17:46
because he definitely broke some rules
17:48
there with Ned but that's a conversation
17:50
for another day the main thing is just
17:52
understanding that each scene needs to
17:55
have a purpose it needs to follow that
17:57
idea of a character's goal their
17:59
conflict what's holding them back from
18:01
achieving their goal and their outcome
18:02
if you are not familiar with this
18:04
breakdown of scenes from goal uh con
18:07
conflict outcome I have a great video
18:09
for you that I will link down below or I
18:11
will put up here in the cards for you to
18:13
check out about writing scenes in this
18:16
way in fact I have an entire series here
18:18
on YouTube with a free workbook that you
18:21
can download all about creating scenes
18:23
just make sure in your multiple POV
18:26
novels that each scene has a purpose and
18:29
there you're telling it from the
18:31
perspective of the character who has the
18:33
most at stake who has the most
18:35
interesting part of the story who has
18:37
the most emotional reaction to what's
18:38
going on it is pivotal that we don't try
18:42
to just have filler chapters where it's
18:44
like well Jackson was next in the
18:46
rotation so I had to have a chapter with
18:48
him even though nothing much is
18:49
happening every single scene needs to
18:51
have a purpose even if it means you
18:53
don't see Jackson for six chapters tip
Character Arc
18:55
number eight is that each character will
18:58
often have their own fully fleshed out
19:00
character Arc they're on fully fleshed
19:03
out backstory and they see themselves as
19:06
the hero of their own store story right
19:08
so even in the will of time Rand might
19:12
be the main character to us as readers
19:13
but Perrin believes he is the main
19:15
character of his own story because it is
19:17
his own life and so each character if
19:20
you really want to tell it well and make
19:21
it compelling needs to have their own
19:24
personality their own full character Arc
19:26
and they need to go through what we know
19:28
as the hero or the heroine's journey now
19:31
that doesn't necessarily mean that we as
19:34
readers will see every detail of each
19:37
character's Arc because we would end up
19:40
with books that are 500 000 words plus
19:42
long it's just that we as authors need
19:46
to know what's going on with those
19:48
characters even if all of those scenes
19:49
don't make it on screen or on the page
19:52
so to speak also what I have found with
19:54
writing a longer series 12 I'm on Book
19:57
12 now with multiple characters as POV
20:00
characters is that oftentimes a
20:03
character like Aaron for example he gets
20:05
a full character Arc but it doesn't
20:07
always span a single book sometimes it
20:10
spans three books before we see his
20:12
fleshed out character Arc and so I would
20:15
love to do a series talking a little bit
20:17
more about this because I feel like it's
20:19
something I've learned through doing and
20:21
reading a lot but it's not something
20:22
that there's many books or articles
20:24
written about so if you want to see more
20:27
in detail about how to actually
20:28
structure a series with multiple points
20:31
of view please let me know in the
Weave Them Together
20:32
comments tip number nine is really more
20:34
of an observation that one of the most
20:36
difficult parts of writing an ensemble
20:38
cast or multiple povs is weaving them
20:41
together in a way that really resonates
20:43
with your style with your genre and with
20:47
your readers themselves so I write young
20:49
adult portal fantasy young adult
20:51
contemporary fantasy and I love twists
20:54
and turns and in fact my readers have
20:56
lovingly named my Cliffhangers Sarah
20:58
hangers because I leave them basically
21:01
on a Dun Dun Dun kind of moment at the
21:03
end of every single chapter and that's
21:04
one of the reasons that I love playing
21:07
with multiple OV so much is because I
21:09
can have Harper going through this
21:11
situation of she has a goal there's a
21:13
conflict and then the outcome is a
21:16
cliffhanger that will lead her into her
21:18
next goal and conflict but I leave her
21:21
hanging and I move on to another
21:22
character's POV who might be in a
21:24
completely different place and my
21:27
favorite authors are brilliant at being
21:29
able to take us to a climax moment for a
21:32
character leave them hanging and leave
21:34
me like dying to turn pages really fast
21:37
to see what happens to that character
21:38
next but then also anchoring me
21:41
immediately in another character's point
21:43
of view and getting me interested in
21:44
them where I'm all over the map I like
21:47
love this character and can't wait to
21:48
see what happens next but I love this
21:50
character too and you so you want to
21:52
make sure
21:53
that you're weaving these points of view
21:55
together in a way that leaves your
21:57
reader feeling exactly the way you want
22:00
them to feel and that is going to be
22:01
very genre dependent so the white way
22:04
you might want to leave someone in a
22:05
women's fiction multiple POV book at the
22:08
end of every chapter might be very
22:09
different than the way you want someone
22:11
to feel at the end of your murder
22:13
mystery chapters or your horror chapters
22:16
so really think about genre when it
22:18
comes to this and I know I've just
22:19
barely touched on some of these items
22:21
but hopefully this has been helpful for
22:23
you and if you want to see a lot more on

22:33
you're writing multiple POV if you're
22:35
interested in writing multiple POV and
22:37
any questions that you might have just
22:40
briefly I'm going to talk a little bit
22:42
about how I am doing this in my own
22:44
current work in progress which is a
22:47
standalone why a thriller called The
22:49
Disappearance of Vanessa Shaw so let's
22:51
take a look okay step into my writing
My Plot Wall
22:55
room with me where I have my entire plot
22:57
figured out on my wall so if you want to
23:01
see how I did this I will link my video
23:02
down below but I basically just took
23:04
easel paper and rolled it out and taped
23:06
it onto my wall and I use sticky notes
23:09
to visually be able to plot my story and
23:11
for me this is super important and super
23:13
helpful especially the color coding and
23:16
the visual of how the scenes flow
23:18
together when it comes to multiple
23:19
points of view because it's just more
23:21
complex type of story to organize so I
23:24
would love to go more in depth in this
23:26
if you guys want to see more in the
23:27
future but for today I'm just going to
23:29
give you a high level overview so you
23:31
can see I have act one act two part one
23:34
act two part two so that means this part
23:36
is the midpoint of the book and then we
23:39
have the conclusion act three Climax and
23:42
resolution on the bottom and and I have
23:45
divided each Act with a little piece of
23:50
washi tape here because the way that I
23:52
have decided to handle multiple POV in
23:55
this particular story is that we have
23:57
not only multiple points of view but we
24:00
have multiple timelines so one timeline
24:03
is present tense so that is the top of
24:07
this line here and you can see that
24:09
every Post-It note on that line is
24:11
purple because in the present day we
24:15
have just one point of view so Lorelei
24:17
who is my main character that the whole
24:19
story is anchored in she is the only
24:22
point of view that we see in the present
24:24
day timeline
24:26
in the past though we also have a
24:28
timeline of the summer leading up to the
24:31
day that Vanessa disappeared and in that
24:34
past timeline which is the bottom
24:36
section here of my Act of each Act of
24:39
the board we have multiple points of
24:42
view which is why you start to see all
24:44
these different colors here and the way
24:46
that I've decided to structure this
24:49
story is that we have Lorelei in the
24:51
present and she is introduced right from
24:54
the start as the sleuth of our story
24:56
she's the one who's trying to figure out
24:59
and can't let go like what actually
25:01
happened to Vanessa and it's still up in
25:03
the air and she believes that the people
25:05
who were there that night Vanessa
25:07
disappeared no more about what really
25:09
happened than what they've ever told
25:11
anyone and so now what's happening is
25:14
it's a year since Vanessa disappeared
25:16
and everyone who was there that night is
25:18
getting together again to honor her
25:20
memory as they're all graduating from
25:22
high school and so Lorelei knows that
25:24
this is her chance to really investigate
25:27
and find out what happened and there's
25:29
really high stakes here for her which
25:31
I'll go into when I talk about this
25:33
story a little bit more but basically
25:35
this is like I need to figure this out
25:37
to be able to move on with my life and
25:40
so she's looking for Clues and she's
25:42
looking for answers to the questions
25:44
about what really happened and so the
25:46
way I'm anchoring these past timeline
25:48
povs is that all of these same people
25:51
are there with her in the present but
25:53
we're only seeing the present tense from
25:55
her perspective but every time something
25:58
happens that triggers a memory of what
26:01
happened that night we go into the past
26:04
and we get to see these different
26:06
characters and what really happened and
26:09
so this in this way I'm weaving these
26:12
together by by something in the present
26:13
triggers a past memory but it's not
26:16
lorealized memory it's a memory of the
26:18
other people that are there that night
26:20
and slowly each person there has some
26:23
kind of secret that gets revealed until
26:26
finally we find out who it is that maybe
26:29
was responsible for Vanessa's
26:31
disappearance so it's a murder mystery
26:33
it's got a little bit of Supernatural
26:36
elements a little bit of elements of
26:37
unreliable narrator and this has been a
26:40
really fun book to figure out but
26:42
hopefully you can see from the tips that
26:44
I kind of came up with a framework here
26:47
of present day is one single POV
26:50
the past tense is all everyone else's
26:53
point of view we do get Lorelei in the
26:55
past as well and so we know when we're
26:58
in someone besides Lorelei that we're
27:00
anchored somewhere in the summer before
27:02
Vanessa disappeared this is very unlike
27:05
any other story that I've done but it
27:07
does hopefully show you a little bit of
27:09
how flexible and interesting multiple
27:12
POV can be thank you so much for being

27:46
[Music]
27:51
thank you
preptober is in full swing over here and today we are going to talk about how do
0:06
you brainstorm and get ideas for your book and then how do you decide which idea to write or which idea is big
0:13
enough to make a whole novel or even an entire Series so I'm going to give you some tips here today I am so excited so
0:20
let's get started [Music]
0:26
whether you are catching this video during preptober where we're getting ready to start a new book for nanowrimo
0:32
in November or you're just finding this in any month this video is going to be helpful in brainstorming and figuring
0:39
out some ideas that might be fun for you to write and that is really the key is
0:45
we want to pick ideas that spark our own imagination that feel fun and so often
0:51
we can get caught up in the idea that it needs to be perfect or it needs to be the very best idea anyone's ever written
0:58
or it has to be completely original but instead during this brainstorming process I want you to really think about
1:03
what do I love to read what types of stories most call to me what am I most
1:09
interested in writing because nine times out of ten the thing that you get passionate about and where your ideas
1:15
just naturally flow is also going to be the thing that you're really good at writing
If you Have No Ideas
1:20
if you have no idea where to even start your brain has just been like too much
1:26
pressure I can't think of any ideas then one of the best places you can start is with things that you have loved in the
1:33
past so Blake Snyder in his book saved the cat talks about just going out to
1:38
Blockbuster and renting like five or so movies in your genre of choice and then
1:44
picking those apart for the elements and the things that you love that's one of the best ways to learn story structure
1:49
well we don't really have access to Blockbuster anymore in this day and age but you do have access to Amazon and
1:57
Apple Books and Google Books you have access potentially to a local bookstore and you have access to Google where you
2:03
can go in and say what are the top books in this genre or you can even just go
2:09
back to your own love of things that you've read in the past or heroines that you've loved the most magic systems that
2:16
were interesting to you the best Mysteries that you've ever watched or consumed think about anime video games
2:22
movies you've loved TV shows you've loved and of course books that you have loved in the past that sparked your
2:28
imagination if you want to you can use my preptober planner so I already have it turned to
2:34
the brainstorming piece but I have created this big planner for you it's 95
Preptober Planner
2:40
Pages this year it's the best one I've ever made for 2023 you can get this totally free and there are some idea
2:46
brainstorming pages in there that are brand new I also have in my resource
2:51
Library that's free for all of my newsletter subscribers I have a entire workbook that's called how to brainstorm
2:57
ideas so you can download that and you can get some ideas from that as well it walks you through some methods that you
3:04
can do but one of the best things you can do is really go back to the things that you used to love who are the
3:11
heroines that you have loved most across TV and movies and books what are the genres that you most love and a genre is
3:18
really just a category or a style so we're talking about is it a small town romance is it a big city like Sex in the
3:24
City Style like women's fiction or romance is it a mystery with a detective or a mystery that's more like a domestic
3:31
Thriller what types of stories have you liked best when you walk into a bookstore what's the genre or section
3:38
that you go to that you love the most that is one of the best places you can start I also recommend if you already
What You Know So Far
3:45
have a few ideas that you've been playing around with you're just not sure which one's the best to go ahead and
3:50
either open up a Google doc or take out a piece of paper and just start writing down everything you know so far that
3:57
sounds interesting they could be disconnected pieces like oh I had this idea about a haunted mansion but I also
4:04
had this idea over here about a dystopian world just get all of that out on the paper because when it's just
4:09
taking up residence in our brain and it isn't a solid idea that we've put to words sometimes it can make it difficult
4:15
to brainstorm because we just feel like we're going on a hamster wheel in our minds so just write down those pieces of
4:21
ideas and get them out on paper before you begin and like I said go through these questions here about like what are
4:27
your favorite villains of all times what types of conflicts do you enjoy and really think through that
4:33
some of you might be coming to your Nano decisions not thinking genre you may
4:39
have that already figured out you might just be thinking what happens in book three of my series and how do I figure
4:44
that out so I'm gonna hopefully give you tips that will help you no matter if you're starting from scratch or if
4:50
you're just trying to figure out what happens next in your Series so here's here's my suggestions of how to move
4:56
forward once you've sort of made those lists and done your brain dump of ideas that are already like taking up space in
5:02
your head here's what I do next so first I want you to take that list that brain dump list of like all the ideas and bits
5:08
and pieces that you've been thinking about or the list of your favorite previous things you've loved or things
5:15
that have inspired you in the past and I want you to start to notice or recognize if there are any patterns there what if
5:22
everything that you've loved the most is science fiction and you didn't realize it until now or what if even across
5:30
different genres you always come back to this theme of found family once you begin to mine your own desires the
5:38
things that you have loved to consume as a reader or viewer or a fan you can start to see these patterns across
5:45
genres or that it's all in one specific Niche what types of tropes you've liked and recognizing those patterns can give
5:52
us some boundaries to work within for our own brainstorming so I want you to find those patterns and write down the
5:57
things that you just consistently see coming up over and over again and we're going to refer back to this later in our
6:03
brainstorming process so the next thing is to really take that pattern those
Creating Boundaries
6:09
patterns the things that you've Loved Before and give yourself a few boundaries so when we just have every
6:16
ideas on the table sometimes it can feel a little bit overwhelming because we're going to have some ideas that are
6:21
science fiction and some that are contemporary and some that are set in the past and some that are set in the future and it can just feel really
6:27
overwhelming because how do we sort between those so instead I want you to take those lists that you created the
6:33
ideas that you've done for and I want you to really start to find those boundaries for yourself and make some
6:39
decisions up front before you decide the idea you like best try to decide the
6:44
genre that you want to focus on for this next novel if you've already like been publishing and you're already well known
6:51
for contemporary romance this could be a really simple step and you can move on to the next piece but if you've never
6:56
published anything before and you've sort of dabbled in lots of different genres I want you to take a look at those patterns the things you've loved
7:02
in the past and pick out what you feel most drawn to right now in terms of genre setting time period so for example
7:10
you might say I'm not sure exactly what I want to write but I'm really drawn to Jane Austen fan fiction right now and I
7:17
would really love to write something that is Jane Austen story based but set in the future or you might say I want to
7:24
write a fantasy novel but I want it to be set in a similar time to our Medieval Times start to put a little bit of
7:30
boundaries on your story is it young adult is an adult novel is it multiple POV is it something set in our
7:38
contemporary time period is it something set in a fantasy world whatever boundaries you already know exist in the
7:44
things that you want to write go ahead and write those down so that we have parameters for our brainstorming another
7:50
parameter that you might set on your brainstorming is if you're ready go ahead and think through what do I want
7:57
to do with this novel once it's finished this might be too overwhelming and you might not know the answer so you can
8:02
just skip it but if you already know like I really want my nanowrimo novel to be the first novel that I self-publish
8:09
then you'll want to be thinking of what are the types of stories I want to be known for as a self-published author
8:16
like most self-published authors don't write one romance and one sci-fi and one fantasy that's not really the best
8:23
practice to getting well known or making money as an author you would want all of your books to be in the same genre so
8:30
you might be thinking what do I most want to be known for writing not just this this book but thinking long term in
8:35
my career what do I most want to write long term or you might say you know what I write romance all the time but I want
8:42
to try something different for Nano and this is going to be just for me or potentially for a pen name or you might be thinking I've been Indie
8:50
but I want to submit something to an agent and see if this can be a book that can be submitted to traditional
8:56
publishing and whichever your intention is for this novel might also help you decide which idea is the best one for
Brainstorming Tips
9:03
you so once you've decided your parameters now I want you to actually do some brainstorming so once you come to
9:10
the table and you're ready to start brainstorming there's a couple of tips I want you to keep in mind as you start this process so one even though you have
9:18
some parameters and some boundaries around your brainstorming like you know which genre you're going to brainstorm
9:23
and what you plan to do with this novel next I want you to otherwise completely open
9:29
your mind no idea is too stupid or it's been done before like let go of all of
9:36
your judgment there are some ways you can get yourself into a no judgment mindset like turn on some music and
9:42
dance around for a little bit give yourself some quiet affirmations like no idea is too stupid everything is on the
9:49
table I'm open myself up to creativity it could also be that you just sit and
9:55
meditate for a few minutes and just completely clear your mind or it could be that you go out to a coffee shop and
10:01
you get yourself into a really good mood and you sit down with a friend and you just State your intention at the beginning and you say no idea is too
10:08
laughable or too silly or too out there everything is open for discussion within
10:14
the boundaries of murder mystery stories give yourself the boundaries and then
10:19
open your mind and make it a judgment-free Zone remember that these are just ideas you don't have to pursue
10:25
any of them but in order order to allow yourself to get to the really juicy creative ideas you have to allow your
10:30
mind to be open and you have to get rid of any perfectionist Tendencies to make it the best story of all time or the
10:37
most unique story instead just let every idea flow every idea is possible and
10:42
then you'll sort through them later I also want you to make sure that you have some kind of method for taking notes of
10:48
everything that happens during your brainstorming session you do not want to end up in a situation where you've just
10:54
blurted out a bunch of ideas and then later you're like what were those ideas like then your time is wasted because we
10:59
can't always remember everything that came out of our mouths or that happened during brainstorming so make sure you
11:04
have a notebook to record it or you have an actual recorder on your phone that's open no matter where you capture it make
11:11
sure you have a way to capture those ideas so you do not lose them sometimes you can also sort of prime yourself and
11:17
get ready for the brainstorming session and get ideas flowing ahead of time by actually going and spending some time
11:23
immersing yourself in that style and tone so you could play a video game that's in that genre or you could watch
11:29
a movie in that genre watch a TV series that's on your list of the things you loved most or read a few chapters of
11:36
your favorite scenes from the book you could also go to some place like Goodreads for example and search top 100
11:42
lists of books in your genre and just read the descriptions and the summaries and it will give you maybe some ideas
11:49
you could also even open up news headlines and see what's been going on in the world lately because maybe some
11:55
of that could Inspire some of your book as well so pull inspiration from lots of places then open your mind and get ready
12:02
to brainstorm let's take a minute to just look at some of the idea brainstorming pages that are
Brainstorming Pages
12:09
in your preptober planner if you have downloaded that so you've got some questions here like what genres do you
12:14
love most often to read and watch list three to five movies or series or anime or books you've loved and what elements
12:19
you loved most about them list of your favorite main characters of all time favorite villains or story conflicts
12:25
settings so this can be another thing that can help you with your brainstorming is there a certain time period a place a World building type
12:33
thing magic system that has ignited your imagination that you thought I want to do something like that what is the main
12:39
POV character in your story like can you imagine things about your detective or your teenager that's going to be in high
12:45
school or this couple that's going to fall in love what's the tone of the story is it going to be humorous is it really serious is it dark and brooding
12:52
is it mysterious what is the tone of this and then what side characters can
12:57
you imagine and then what's the central conflict of the story you may not know this yet but if you can brainstorm some
13:02
of that stuff that might help you but there's lots of sort of brainstorming things here that you can use to help you
13:09
in this process but once you want to follow through with my brainstorming method
Brainstorm The Premise
13:15
you can either do this inside a Google doc or something like digital or you can just grab a plain old piece of paper and
13:22
you can do this I also like to set a timer just because if I give myself two
13:27
hours to just sit and do it I'm going to get distracted I'm going to just kind of
13:32
look through things online and I'm just not going to get a focus set of ideas
13:38
but when I set a timer for say 10 minutes on my phone I tend to just focus
13:43
my brain in and I can just bullet ideas out and I don't overthink them you know
13:48
yourself better than anyone are you going to overthink or is the timer going to make you panic and just do whatever
13:54
feels best to you there's no right or wrong way to brainstorm if you have multiple genres that you've
14:01
determined you like like one of them might be I'm thinking of writing a why a dystopian story similar to like Hunger
14:09
Games you would fill one paper out with why a dystopian and then you might have another one where you're thinking I just
14:14
want to tell kind of like a why a witchy story so that's a second one and then the third one might be or I kind of also
14:22
love domestic thrillers so these are very different genres so
14:28
your ideas are going to be very different but if you're just not sure which genre yet then make a sheet of
14:33
paper and set a timer for each one of them I'm just gonna turn to the why a witchy stories because that's typically
14:39
what I tend to write so let's say I knew I was going to write why a witchy if you already know that you're writing a type
14:45
of series you don't just need a boundary of the genre your boundary is I'm
14:51
looking for book 12 of my series and I'm just trying to come up with the theme of this particular story so write out
14:57
whatever is the best parameters for your particular situation set a timer I like
15:03
to set a timer for just a short period of time like 10 or 15 minutes and then no distractions just allow yourself to
15:11
write out as many ideas as possible and sometimes I will even go ahead and pre make some little marks so that it sets
15:19
my brain up for okay I have all these slots to fill out so timer starts you
15:24
start writing down your ideas so it doesn't have to be detailed plots or anything like that it can just literally
15:30
be the first thing that comes to mind like what about a girl who solves Mysteries uh with magic
15:38
or it could be an idea of what if it was Pretty Little Liars with witches or what
15:46
if it was a witch Academy Story and you just kind of start in this idea
15:53
of asking yourself what if and don't judge the ideas just literally like anything
15:58
that comes out even if it's like stupid what if it's a witch with a Magic Pickle like who cares it can be the dumbest
16:05
idea ever and then you can just scratch through and be like well that was stupid but you want to tell your brain I'm just
16:11
trying to come up with any and everything and it can be based on other stories like pretty low Liars it could
16:16
be based on your previous things that you've written or previous things that you've loved but just let your mind go until the timer comes off and hopefully
16:23
by then you have at least a few ideas on the page once the timer has gone off or
Choose Your Favorites
16:29
your time period for working on this has ended I want you to go through and take your highlighter or marker or something
16:37
and I want you to circle the idea that you liked the best out of this set of ideas
16:42
maybe there's a couple that you really loved look and listen for your own intuition were there any stories that
16:48
gave you Goosebumps that made you laugh that already made you feel something emotional in your gut that you were like
16:54
oh that I could see that being a really good story or wow I really would love to tell a story about a wounded veteran who
17:00
finds Love Like These are the stories that I love most Circle it then I want
17:05
you to repeat the process because the first set of ideas are really going to be the things that have already been
17:11
sort of top of mind or things you've seen other people do or they're based on previous things but if you really want
17:16
to give your brain access to those deeper Stories the things that maybe aren't as common or overdone or the
17:24
things that just haven't like you want to press yourself to really dig into your most creative ideas you want to
17:31
continue to get more than just the surface of ideas so set the timer again or give yourself another period of time
17:37
if the timer doesn't work for you and just start thinking of more so the next round you might come up with you know
17:44
several more ideas I'm not going to give you examples because it would take me forever then you Circle it again say
17:50
okay well this was the second idea I liked you go through the process again until you feel like you have exhausted
17:56
all the ideas that you can think of and the timer runs and you're just like I can't think of anything else that could
18:02
potentially happen you can in between sessions do like I had mentioned like where you go and you
18:08
play a video game or you watch something that you previously used to love in that genre or you read through lists of books
18:15
and descriptions on Goodreads and then you get more ideas and then you come back and you bounce off those ideas until you feel like you've kind of
18:21
exhausted yourself then I want you to take a little bit of a break from it maybe a day or an hour and then come
18:29
back to your list and I want you to look back through the ones that you circled or highlighted for some of you there may
18:35
just be one and now you know that's the story that you most want to write for Nano and you're done for some of you
18:41
there might be 50 ideas that are highlighted so then you can go through with another color and now that you have
18:47
a better sort of grip on which ones have been kind of on your mind for the last hour or things that have sparked your
18:54
imagination maybe you could think of a combination of these two items and that becomes another item now that your
18:59
brain's had some time to think through it but I want you to go through your list and I want you to start eliminating things because eventually we need to
19:07
come up with an idea like eventually we have to make a decision so go through this and then I want you to pick out
19:13
your top three ideas Max three max if you get stuck on five or six then
19:20
bring it to the group so heart breathing's writing Community or do a poll in your own reader group or go to
19:26
your author friends and see which ideas they think are the most marketable or go
19:31
back and think about your intentions for this book and say okay which book idea do I think is most likely to get an
19:38
agent's attention and just pick your top three max ideas and let's move forward
19:45
with those so once you have those top ideas the next thing that I like to do
Expand 3 Potential Ideas
19:51
is take out let's say I had two that I really loved the most I would get these
19:56
bigger note cards you can also do this just on another plain sheet of paper or in a Google doc or anything like that
20:01
and I would write those ideas at the top of the page so for example let's say Pretty Little Liars with witches
20:11
uh can't type I can't write when I'm also talking So Pretty Little Liars with
20:17
witches and let's say I combined these ideas um in an academy so it's a witch Academy Story and it's
20:24
got a Pretty Little Liars Vibe and then let's say the um let's say we had magic in a contemporary
20:32
High School and it's going to be a mystery and maybe that's all we know like it's just a very
20:39
loose ideas sometimes I will color code these just because I love to use markers so I'll say this idea is my blue idea
20:45
this idea is my pink idea and then I'm going to do what I did again on the other one you can do this just with
20:51
bullet points on your page if you're using a Google doc but there's something
20:57
about just giving yourself the space and the bullet points that I think makes your mind say okay I'm going to fill in
21:03
these slots this is going to be cool and I want you to take each idea separately and again with a timer or a period of
21:10
time that you're going to give yourself I want you to start brainstorming through some things like conflict and
21:18
setting what's the time period this is set in can I imagine anything about this
21:24
story world who are the main characters in this story what's the conflict of this story and just start expanding on
21:31
this idea but I don't want this to be like we haven't chosen our idea yet so you don't want to spend like weeks and
21:36
weeks on it we're talking about just 10 minutes and saying is there anything I can just really quickly rattle off about
21:44
Pretty Little Liars with witches in an academy so you set your timer and you fill in as many of these little bullet
21:51
points as you can so you might say okay we have a main character with Raven
21:56
hair who can shift into a crow
22:02
obviously I would probably write it better than that because I would have more time but I'm trying to make this fast so we know this about our main
22:09
character let's say it's set in a uh like a Gothic castle in the mountains
22:17
and it's a world where witches are forbidden and just think of anything about the
22:24
world the weather the setting the tone the characters I can imagine that one
22:29
one student has gone missing and there's uh you know spooky
22:37
sounds in the hallway and you just rattle off as many ideas
22:42
about the setting the tone the characters the dialogue anything you can think of if you're a visual person start
22:48
closing your eyes and imagine what can I see about this world does it immediately come up where I can see some of the town
22:56
or the castle or the setting the weather you know is there anything that comes to
23:02
mind then you know if you could do the next idea tomorrow or you could just take a little bit of a break to give
23:08
your space between the two and then come back to the second idea and you can do this for as many ideas as you have but
23:14
this is part of why I say picks a Max of three because if you had 50 ideas and you were doing this for each one it's
23:19
going to take you hours and hours and it might kind of get to a point where your ideas farther down the line don't even
23:25
really get any of your energy because you're exhausting yourself so then we say what about magic in a contemporary
23:32
high school and what would that mystery look like okay so you set the timer and you start brainstorming this one but
23:38
let's say immediate immediately you're like this world is not as Rich to me and I can't really think as much about what
23:44
might be happening in this contemporary high school but let's say it's an orphan girl who
23:51
uh who just moved to town and then just say uh she's living with
23:58
her grandmother uh let's say we can see her best friend uh that she meets on day one
24:07
is a little bit of a mysterious quirky girl
24:13
and then you can think of a few more ideas as the timer goes just filling through the process going
24:20
through the process of of allowing yourself 10 minutes to think about this one story and writing down anything that
24:27
you can think of about the tone or the genre of the world the stakes the conflict anything like that will already
24:33
start to give you an idea of which story is going to flow better because one of them will seem more Rich will seem more
24:40
automatic to your brain the ideas will start to flow if you're lucky enough that you have multiple that begin to
24:45
flow then you just pick the one that you think sounds most interesting or most marketable or that you just like the
24:52
best and now you have multiple ideas that you could go with and you can't go wrong but if there's one that you're
24:58
like okay this fantasy which is in this haunted castle that really got my
25:03
imagination going this is the story that I'm gonna write but now that you've chosen which story
Is It Big Enough?
25:09
you like best how do you know if there's enough here to make it into a full novel
25:14
well for me when I'm thinking about whether something's big enough to be a book it's really coming down to genre
25:21
and conflict so like I said the genre is just the category or style of the book so think
25:28
about or even just Google let's say the genre here is going to be a fantasy
25:35
like why a fantasy with witches I could Google this why a
25:42
fantasy with witches elements of why a fantasies with witches or if you were writing a small town contemporary
25:48
romance you could Google elements of small town contemporary romance novels and you're gonna find blogs and videos
25:56
and lists of the typical things that you find in that kind of story or if you are
26:01
pulling off of things that you've loved in the past you would already have a knowledge of what types of things you
26:07
would expect in a story that is a witchy Academy right because you've read
26:13
multiple of them you kind of know what typically happens in these types of stories so you can compare those types
26:21
of stories and what you know about them or that list of elements to the list that you've just made do you have some
26:27
of the fundamental elements that are already coming to mind that would make up a story like this is there a big
26:34
enough conflict to just defy this story are the stakes high enough because if
26:39
we're just a Pretty Little Liars in a magical Academy but there's no murder mystery and there's no mystery and it's just girls like hanging out in an
26:46
academy that's not really enough for a story it doesn't mean we can't build on
26:52
it though what we need if we have a story that's not big enough is we need more conflict so we say well okay let me
26:59
throw in one of the girls has disappeared and everyone is blaming this one dorm room let's say they stay four
27:05
to a dorm room and one of the four girls has gone missing and they all blame you
27:11
know girl a in the room then now we've got conflict because maybe her roommates are afraid of her maybe everyone thinks
27:18
that she's keeping something from them and maybe there's these spooky ghosts now we have a conflict that can carry us
27:25
through the entire story because we've got this missing girl and we know we're trying to figure out what really happened to her so think about the
27:32
elements of your genre and figure out do you have have the same type of conflict
27:38
or similar type of conflict and things at stake in your story as you would typically find in this type of genre and
27:45
if it matches those elements then you know your story is big enough same thing when it comes to a series like if you
27:52
are telling a story about which is in an academy do you have enough there with
27:58
the relationships and the things going on in this Academy that you could tell an entire series about it the first book
28:04
could be about this first missing student but then the second book could be about a new mystery that was brought
28:09
to light in the first one where in her investigation she found a mysterious Library downstairs and now the second
28:16
book is about the truth of the story she found in the library so can you continue
28:21
to expand on this or is this just a very narrow short story kind of idea and it
28:26
really comes down to the conflict and the characters and what's typical of
28:32
this genre another thing that you can do when you're starting this brainstorming thing
Brainstorm Scenes
28:37
you say okay I'm pretty sure this is the idea that I'm going to go with is you can come here to your preptober or
28:44
planner and here I have like a basic outline of a novel like the title the basic premise which you would write here
28:50
Pretty Little Liars in a witchy Academy or whatever main conflict is one student has disappeared and they're blaming the main
28:57
character and then the resolution is that they find out at the end that the girl was being kidnapped by one of the
29:04
teachers you know or whatever here on this page you have a spot to list up to 10 possible or potential
29:11
scenes and so the next stage of your brainstorming can actually be taking that premise that you just came up with
29:18
and then can I imagine 10 different scenes that would be typical in a book like this so maybe the first scene is
29:25
your character arriving to this magical Academy the second scene is her meeting her new roommates and there's something
29:31
off about some of the other girls the third scene is they've discovered that one of the roommates has been murdered
29:37
or is missing and some of her blood was discovered on your main character's cloak might be their first day in Magic
29:45
class you know can you think of these scenes and of course your genre may be totally different from this but you kind
29:50
of already have an idea of the typical typical scenes that appear in your genre so can you map that to your own story if
29:57
you can't then your idea might need more time or more fleshing out you might need more tools like my how to write and plan
30:04
a series or my how to plot your novel stuff or wait until we get into the World building video next which is going
30:10
to help you flush some of this out too if the ideas are coming Fast and Furious and you're getting more and more excited
30:16
about it then you know that you have landed upon your perfect idea for nanowrimo congratulations okay so
More Thoughts on Brainstorming
30:23
hopefully by now you have some really good ideas or at least some really good tools that you can pull from again
30:29
remember that just because I mention it doesn't mean that you need to do it this way so really you know yourself better
30:34
than anyone so you know whether a timer is going to make you feel more pressure or it's going to work for you so just
30:41
take the pieces that work for you and let go of the rest rest and feel free to adapt and be flexible in any piece of
30:46
this process if you are ready go ahead and choose that one idea and then come
30:52
back on Sunday where we will be talking about World building setting and description and then later in the month
30:57

for staying focused while you're writing
0:25
[Music]
0:29
okay before we get started I just wanted
0:32
to say two things one thank you so much
0:34
to all of the super amazing comments and
0:36
concern over our quick evacuation for
0:40
hurricane Florence as many of you know
0:42
I'm in Charleston South Carolina
0:43
like right almost right on the beach on
0:45
an island and so we evacuated but
0:48
luckily nothing happened here in this
0:50
area the storm went north of us so we
0:52
got lucky here and my thoughts go out to
0:54
any of you who were affected by
0:56
Hurricane Florence hopefully you guys
0:59
are all safe and sound but luckily
1:01
everything was fine here and we ended up
1:03
evacuating to Florida and it all worked
1:05
out great so that's why there hasn't
1:07
been a video in a week but I'm getting
1:09
one up today and number two I also
1:11
wanted to remind you guys that today is
1:14
the beginning of my very first course
1:15
the finished strong three-day boot camp
1:18
launches tonight with a kickoff call and
1:20
goes throughout the weekend
1:21
this comes with my custom-designed
1:23
planner for the next 90 days I'm
1:26
teaching you a little bit more about how
1:27
to set up this Kanban productivity board
1:29
behind me and pretty much to set all of
1:31
your goals and all of your tasks and
1:33
projects for the final quarter of the
1:35
year and this is something you'll be
1:37
able to use for the rest of your life I
1:38
would love to have you join us so that
1:40
you can finish strong with your
1:42
productivity and your writing this year
1:44
and it really applies to anyone who is a
1:46
creative entrepreneur so come join us
1:48
we've got editors and writers and just
1:50
all kinds of different people in the
1:52
course so the link will be down below
1:53
for you if you're interested in that
1:55
otherwise let's get down to my top seven
1:58
tips so number one is to set a specific
Set a specific time
2:01
time on your schedule for writing if you
2:04
want to stay focused then you have to
2:07
get your mind in the right place to be
2:09
writing and if you don't set something
2:11
on your schedule or on your calendar
2:13
that says this is the block of time that
2:15
I'm gonna be writing chances are when
2:17
you get home from work or you are
2:19
sitting around on a Saturday morning or
2:21
whatever it is you're doing you might be
2:23
thinking you know what I'd really like
2:25
to write right now but I think I'm gonna
2:28
watch this show on Netflix or whatever
2:30
so that's one of the first struggles of
2:32
actually sitting down to write but in
2:33
terms of staying focused while you're
2:35
writing I think it helps to know ahead
2:37
of time that this is going to be my
2:39
writing time it's like a mental
2:41
preparation that says when I sit down on
2:43
Tuesday at 2 o'clock that's my writing
2:46
time and so for the next 24 hours or
2:48
whatever it is I've already got this
2:50
expectation that the writing time is
2:52
coming and my subconscious mind is
2:54
already kind of working on the ideas
2:55
getting me ready to be writing or
2:57
likewise if I set a schedule for myself
2:59
that I'm gonna get up every morning and
3:00
I'm gonna write from 9:00 to 11:00 every
3:02
single day then that schedule and that
3:05
intention being set ahead of time just
3:07
kind of mentally prepares me to be
3:10
writing during that time and I've found
3:11
this to be extremely helpful with my
3:14
writing focus now that doesn't mean that
3:15
I won't like sneak in sometime when I
3:17
have extra time that I hadn't planned
3:19
but I almost always find that when I've
3:22
planned ahead of time I've got so much
3:24
more natural focus because my body and
3:27
mind was ready for that writing time if
3:29
that makes sense
3:30
number 2 put your phone on do not
3:32
disturb don't allow any distractions let
3:35
your family know your friends know let
3:38
everyone in your life that might come
3:40
distract you know that this is your
3:42
writing time and you are just completely
3:43
unavailable even if you go out to Barnes
3:46
& Noble put some headphones in don't
3:48
make eye contact with people this is not
3:50
social time this is the time to sit down
3:52
and write so just don't allow
3:54
distractions put a note on your door if
3:57
you have an office that says I'm writing
3:58
don't knock
3:59
give your family some kind of schedule
4:01
set those boundaries for yourself but do
4:04
not allow distractions and even when it
4:05
comes to like just your phone or your
4:07
devices that you have if you're writing
4:10
try to download a chrome app or
4:12
something that will allow you to turn
4:14
off your social media or your
4:16
notifications so that there's not
4:17
something popping up every five minutes
4:19
while you're writing that says you've
4:21
got a new email or someone just private
4:23
message to you on Facebook because
4:25
that's number one focus and pride
4:27
tivity killer while you're writing is
4:28
that little ding of your phone that's
4:30
like being oh let me check and see what
4:32
so-and-so said and now you're suddenly
4:34
in a conversation for 10 minutes on
4:36
facebook messenger about your best
4:38
friends like burrito that she just aide
4:40
that is not a good use of your writing
4:42
time so set yourself up for success
4:43
ahead of time by just not allowing those
4:45
distractions to come into your writing
4:47
space and time number 3 use writing
Use writing sprints
4:50
sprints this is probably the number one
4:52
thing that helped me stay focused while
4:54
I'm writing when I used to just say okay
4:57
I'm gonna sit down for this hour and I'm
4:59
gonna write it was like an hour was just
5:01
too long for my brain to stay focused
5:03
and so what would happen is I would
5:05
maybe write for 10 15 20 minutes and
5:08
then I would start getting tired my
5:10
brain would start wandering the words
5:12
weren't coming as quickly and I would
5:14
find like for example in an hour I could
5:17
maybe write a thousand words which is
5:18
great but it was not my top producing
5:23
speed well what ended up happening for
5:26
us was my husband was playing this game
5:28
we we met playing this game called
5:29
EverQuest 2 and when I wasn't able to
5:32
play that as much because I was writing
5:34
so much he started playing a game called
5:35
Global Agenda and that game was sort of
5:38
more of a PvP I think style or an arena
5:40
style game and he would queue up for a
5:43
group event and then he would go in and
5:46
it would last the tournament or whatever
5:49
would last anywhere from like 8 minutes
5:51
to 15 minutes and so what we did was we
5:54
decided to play a little kind of like a
5:55
little challenge game with each other
5:57
because our computers were right next to
5:58
each other and he would let me know when
6:01
he was queueing up and he would go into
6:03
the game and the minute he would go in
6:05
he would say go and I would go and I
6:08
would write and whenever he was finished
6:10
with his tournament he would say ok stop
6:13
time and he would compare how many
6:15
points he had gotten in the tournament
6:16
to how many words I had written now I
6:17
know this is kind of silly and it
6:19
doesn't work for everyone but it was
6:20
just kind of like a little fun thing and
6:22
what I started to notice because I had
6:24
never heard of writing Sprint's at this
6:26
point this was probably 10 years ago
6:27
what I started to notice was when I
6:29
focused for that short quick period of
6:32
time and I was focused on getting a lot
6:35
of words down and really like immersing
6:37
myself in the story at just the snap of
6:39
a finger
6:39
I could write 5
6:41
600 words in 10 minutes it was in saying
6:44
now I'm not saying those were all the
6:46
most quality words that I've ever
6:47
written but it started getting me
6:49
thinking that if I could utilize these
6:52
like short bursts then maybe I could be
6:55
more productive overall and it has
6:57
totally changed my life over the last
6:59
ten years so what I like to do is I will
7:02
set a number of Sprint's that I want to
7:04
write so I'll say I'm going to work for
7:06
two hours which means I have four blocks
7:09
of 25 minutes with a five-minute break
7:11
in between so I will write only for that
7:14
25 minutes and then I'll you know I've
7:16
set a timer on my phone I have a one of
7:18
my favorite writer apps for Android is
7:20
called write ometer and I love it
7:22
because you can just it's right on my
7:24
desk top of my phone and I can just
7:25
click start and it will start a writing
7:28
sprint for 25 minutes and then when it's
7:30
done it will ding and I can enter how
7:32
many words I got written before I start
7:34
the next one so I'll write for 25
7:36
minutes and stay completely focused no
7:38
distractions no messages no Facebook
7:40
nobody can talk to me if anybody even
7:43
tries to talk to me it's like nope
7:44
I'm writing and I'm so focused for that
7:47
25 minutes but something in the back of
7:49
my mind knows this is temporary I don't
7:51
have to do this forever these words
7:53
don't have to be the best words I've
7:54
ever written but it allows me to focus
7:56
so intensely that I can write more now
8:00
in 25 minutes then I can write in an
8:02
hour because I'm so focused then I get
8:05
that 5-minute break I can get up I can
8:07
grab a coffee I can do whatever and then
8:08
I start right back again running my
8:11
writing time through sprints has been
8:12
probably my number one focus and
8:14
productivity tool when it comes to
8:16
learning how to actually get my writing
8:18
done so number four is to plan ahead and
8:21
what I'm talking about is your plot so I
Plot your novel
8:23
just finished if you haven't watched it
8:25
yet I will link it for you down below or
8:27
put a card up here somewhere in a part
8:29
series on how to plot your novel and I
8:31
have found I know that some people are
8:33
Panthers and that's what helps them and
8:35
if that is your thing then you go do
8:37
your thing because I know that what
8:38
works for one person doesn't work for
8:40
everyone but if you are a planner or you
8:43
find that you think you're a pantser and
8:46
when you sit down you just your mind
8:48
wanders everywhere and you just cannot
8:49
seem to focus on your story try plotting
8:52
out your novel because one of the number
8:54
one
8:54
things that helps me focus while writing
8:56
is that I have a set of note cards and
8:58
they're pretty much always here by my
9:01
desk and what I will do when I'm
9:03
plotting is I will put down the exact
9:05
scene that I want to write on each one
9:08
of these note cards in order if you
9:09
watch my plotting videos you will see
9:11
kind of how I plot out scenes and
9:13
everything so I'll have a scene written
9:14
on a note card then when I sit down to
9:16
do my 25 minutes prints or whatever was
9:19
my scheduled writing time all I have to
9:20
do is pick up the top note card and I'm
9:22
ready to go I know exactly what I'm
9:24
gonna write one of the things that kills
9:26
productivity and focus while you're
9:28
trying to write is that you don't really
9:29
know what's coming next and you feel
9:31
like you're wasting time or you know
9:33
your brain is just kind of wandering
9:34
around all these different plot ideas if
9:36
you take the time to plot and plan your
9:38
story ahead of time then when you sit
9:41
down to write
9:42
you're gonna naturally be more focused
9:43
because you know exactly what you're
9:45
trying to get done in this writing
9:46
session tip number five is don't break
Dont break the chain
9:49
the chain so what I mean by this is
9:51
there's a giant Jerry Seinfeld quote I'm
9:54
in a totally butcher this but he said at
9:56
one point somebody said how do you write
9:58
so many jokes how do you stay so fresh
10:00
with your content and he said I write a
10:02
joke every single day and I don't break
10:05
the chain and basically what he means is
10:07
you write your words on day one and day
10:10
two and day three and you just see how
10:12
many days in a row you can keep that
10:14
chain going and I have found that this
10:16
helps with my focus because if I say
10:20
take five days off of writing then on
10:23
that sixth day when I come back to my
10:25
story
10:25
I have to reacquaint myself with where I
10:27
wasn't the story with what I was writing
10:30
about with that inspiration for that
10:32
scene or whatever and it always takes me
10:35
time to get back into the groove of it
10:36
and sometimes it can take me a few days
10:38
to get back into the flow well then if I
10:41
interrupt that flow by yet again taking
10:43
three or four days off then I'm
10:45
constantly it's kind of like restarting
10:47
an engine every single time you sit down
10:48
to write so one of the ways that I have
10:50
helped my focus and productivity while
10:52
writing is that I don't break the chain
10:54
I try to run these challenges I have a
10:56
writing sprint group that I run on
10:58
Facebook that we do this all the time
11:01
and we try to set a monthly don't break
11:04
the chain challenge and not only do we
11:06
set a goal for writing at least
11:08
500 words a day every single day of the
11:10
month but we also set rewards for
11:12
ourselves and say if I make it through
11:14
every single day of this month then I'm
11:17
gonna reward myself with and you tell
11:19
yourself something that you want to do a
11:20
trip to Starbucks a trip out to do
11:22
something for dinner or new pens and
11:25
washi tape just saying that might be
11:27
something that I tend to reward myself
11:29
with a lot if you write every day and
11:32
try not to break that chain or keep the
11:34
chain going as long as possible
11:35
especially when you're first drafting
11:37
your story you will find that your focus
11:40
tends to build up because you stay
11:42
immersed in that story you stay
11:43
interested and when you sit down to pick
11:45
up your story where you left off you
11:47
just left off yesterday so your mind is
11:49
more fresh and it helps you stay more
11:51
focused while you're working on it tip
11:53
number six is to set up a writing ritual
Set a writing ritual
11:55
and this is something that Steven
11:57
Pressfield talks about in his book the
12:00
war of art not the art of war but the
12:04
war of art he talks about resistance and
12:06
sometimes we don't want to sit down and
12:08
what can help you start to write and
12:09
what he talks about towards the
12:11
beginning of that book is that one of
12:13
the way he conquers like that resistance
12:15
of sitting down to actually get his work
12:17
done is he does a routine like a ritual
12:19
where he'll touch his hat and turn it to
12:22
the side and you know sharpen his pencil
12:24
or do whatever and I started
12:27
implementing this in small ways early in
12:29
my career and this has really helped me
12:31
and this goes back to the same thing
12:32
it's like setting that schedule for
12:34
yourself it's yes it's a ritual that you
12:36
do right before you start writing so you
12:38
may ask like how is that going to help
12:39
me stay focused while I'm writing but
12:41
the truth is it gets you ready to write
12:45
it gets your mind in that mental space
12:47
to calm down it may take you a few times
12:50
like maybe a couple of weeks of doing
12:52
this before it starts to actually like
12:54
affect your brain but I can't remember
12:57
who said this but it could have been a
12:59
Stephen King quote or maybe Nora Roberts
13:00
which I know it's crazy to get the two
13:02
mixed up but I heard this somewhere so
13:04
if anybody knows the reference comment
13:05
down below but they basically said you
13:08
sit down every single day to write and
13:09
it's like inviting the muse to come in
13:12
and at first she may not show up but
13:15
once she knows that you come knocking at
13:17
her door or that you come calling for
13:19
her every day at 8:00
13:20
she's gonna eventually start to show up
13:22
and I love that quote because it's it's
13:25
so true that you know even if you
13:28
struggle to get into the right mindset
13:29
to be writing and to get focused when
13:31
you need to get focused if you set these
13:34
cues these mental cues like setting a
13:36
schedule and starting a routine for
13:37
yourself just these little things that
13:39
you do right before you write you'll
13:41
start to notice that it's a mental cue
13:45
for your brain to sort of calm down
13:47
focus on the story shut out all those
13:49
distractions and say okay here I am this
13:52
is writing time and once you really get
13:54
into that mental place you're gonna find
13:56
that it is so much easier to focus for a
13:59
longer period of time on your writing
14:01
because your brain is trained to know
14:03
this is writing time one of the things
14:06
that I do is I have like little trinkets
14:08
of Hello Kitty with me now this is one
14:11
that's heavier so it stays on my desk
14:13
but I always like will touch her before
14:15
I start writing and if I'm out writing
14:18
like Barnes and Noble or whatever some
14:19
of you might have seen pictures of my
14:20
Instagram or in my YouTube blogs and
14:23
stuff like that for my writing channel
14:24
that I will have like little trinkets
14:27
with me sometimes their Hello kitties
14:28
sometimes their tokidoki Zoar like
14:30
little pigs like this but there are just
14:32
usually little plastic things and I will
14:33
set them up in a row in front of my
14:36
computer and they're easy to carry with
14:37
me in my bag and it's just a little
14:39
mental thing of like I'm gonna set up
14:41
these cute little things that I love
14:42
that make me happy that make me smile
14:44
but it's also a little tip to my brain
14:47
saying guess what it's writing time I'm
14:48
going to give you a little bit of
14:50
warning by setting these things up and
14:51
let you know and now we're gonna start
14:53
I've also heard of people starting like
14:56
essential oil diffuser I usually have a
14:58
candle here beside my desk that I like
15:01
to light and a certain scent I will try
15:03
to have a certain scent for each book so
15:05
right now I've been writing with
15:06
strawberry scent but any kind of little
15:08
writing ritual that you can do to get
15:10
ready will signal to your brain it's
15:12
time to start and that will help you to
15:13
show up better and to stay focused while
15:15
you're working and finally tip number
15:17
seven is to set realistic goals now it
Set realistic goals
15:21
is so difficult I find to sit down and
15:25
think some huge goal like I'm gonna
15:27
write 5,000 words in an hour and I know
15:29
there are some people that can do that
15:30
but I have never been able to write
15:31
5,000 words
15:32
our and if I set that huge of a goal for
15:35
myself let's say my average is a
15:37
thousand words an hour if I suddenly am
15:39
like every day instead of trying to
15:41
stick to that realistic average I'm
15:42
gonna try to blow it out of the water
15:44
every day I need to write five thousand
15:45
words I am
15:46
almost always going to somewhere in the
15:49
back of my head know that it's
15:50
impossible and so I'm gonna sabotage it
15:53
it's just a mental thing and I think
15:54
that's true for a lot of us so I sit
15:56
down determine I'm gonna write five
15:58
thousand words and I'm so stuck on that
16:00
unrealistic goal and the pressure that I
16:01
put on myself to write so many words and
16:03
make them the best they've ever written
16:05
and all that stuff that I just
16:07
completely shut down and my brain is
16:09
like hamster on a wheel like I can't
16:11
come up with what I'm supposed to write
16:12
I'm distractible they're so oh there's
16:14
something out the window there's this
16:15
going on there's this going on because I
16:17
already know deep down I'm not gonna hit
16:19
that goal well who do I think I am
16:21
thinking I'm gonna write that ridiculous
16:22
amount of words right so what I love to
16:25
do instead is to set very realistic
16:29
goals even if it's just 500 words and
16:31
sometimes when I'm particularly tired
16:33
and don't feel like focusing I will set
16:34
ridiculously low amounts of words I'll
16:36
say I'm gonna write 50 words I'm gonna
16:38
write one sentence okay I'm gonna set my
16:40
timer for 25 minutes and I'm I'll write
16:42
one sentence and that's all I have to do
16:44
but something about taking the pressure
16:46
off by setting an extremely easy goal
16:48
and a realistic goal allows me to just
16:51
open up my creativity I think when we
16:53
put those stressful expectations on our
16:57
creativity it can sometimes shut us down
16:58
and so we naturally don't want to be
17:00
focused on the writing because it's
17:02
scary to us as a little trick for
17:04
yourself set a super realistic
17:06
ridiculously easy goal set a timer get
17:09
your ritual in place and start writing
17:11
and see what happens
17:12
if I set that hundred word goal or
17:14
whatever almost always by the end of
17:16
that 25 minutes I'm going to have at
17:18
least 500 words if not more sometimes
17:20
even a thousand in the last in 25
17:22
minutes because my brain is not so
17:24
focused on like I've got to do the
17:26
impossible it's free to just say I can
17:29
totally do this it's like this little
17:31
pep talk like oh this is going to be
17:32
easy I can totally do it and it sort of
17:34
frees you up to be more creative alright
17:36
guys so those are my top seven tips for
17:39
how to stay focused while writing I hope
17:41

[Music]

hey guys welcome back to heart breathing's today we are going to talk about one of my favorite parts of
0:06
writing to really think about and plan in my novels which is pacing so if you're interested in some of my writing
0:12
tips about how to pace your novel in order to make it better and to keep readers turning pages into the night
0:18
then just stick around so this is one of
0:24
my favorite writing topics and something that I didn't really get a handle on until several novels in but now it's one
0:31
of my favorite things to not only play within my writing but also to kind of plan in advance and to really like make
0:38
sure that my story hooks readers end from the start and then keeps them turning pages that's
0:44
always my goal and even though I know I always have a lot to learn I think that this is something I'm getting better and
0:50
better at with practice so let's talk about pacing so if you're new to my channel my name is Sarah cannon I am the
0:57
author of more than 25 young adult and new adult novels and I have a little
1:02
baby at home and she's upstairs in her jumper so you might hear a little bit of noises coming from you know the various
1:09
little electronic toys so just ignore so what is pacing pacing in your novel or
1:16
short story or any written story is all about how fast or slow your story
1:22
unfolds so pacing can be manipulated and controlled both on a structural level
1:28
for the entire story or the entire novel we're mostly just going to talk about novels in general today although you can
1:34
bring this down into novellas and short stories as well applies to all of them you can think about pacing in terms of
1:41
the overall structure of your entire novel but you can also think about pacing within each act of your novel
1:47
within every chapter or every scene and then even within every sentence and how
1:53
you're using different types of you know different lengths of sentences different types of words every single word choice
2:00
matters when it comes to pacing so we're gonna kind of pick this apart a little bit and I'm gonna give you some examples
2:05
so before we get into the examples and the nitty-gritty let's talk about why pacing is important so first of all
2:12
pacing is super important because if you go too slow with your story if your story is unfolding too slowly it can
2:19
start to get really boring and you're going to end up with readers that just kind of give up because you're not getting to the action or the point of
2:26
the story so this obviously can be genre specific and I'll talk about that more in just a minute
2:31
but if you go too fast with how your story unfolds and you don't give the reader basically any time to breathe
2:38
between action and fight scenes then sometimes what can happen is they fall
2:44
asleep on the edge of their seats and now I can't even remember who it was that said that but I know that came from
2:49
a writing book that I read many years ago it was either Donald Moss or James Scott Bell or maybe James Frey and I
2:56
can't remember now so I'm gonna look that up and try to put it in the description box below but I remember reading a book about how to structure
3:02
your novel and he was talking about how when you go too fast and you never let up like action from the very first scene
3:08
to the end of the book readers can fall asleep on the edge of their seats meaning that it's go-go-go and you're
3:14
not putting any emotional beats in or any reaction scenes in and it becomes boring because there's too much action
3:21
so let's talk about how pacing is sort of influenced by what genre you're writing obviously if you're writing a
3:28
long sweeping historical or a long sweeping epic type novel readers are
3:33
gonna expect with this very long three hundred thousand word epic or whatever
3:38
it is that you're going to take more time for your description for things to unfold there's going to be more like
3:46
internal monologue or more like sweeping description of the landscape and things like that because what you're doing in a
3:53
long sweeping epic whether it's epic fantasy or an epic historical or whatever it is you're setting a scene
3:59
and readers are there for the experience of seeing everything that you're seeing or experiencing who these characters are
4:05
and there's often like multiple POVs and other things that come into play but they're expecting a story that unfolds
4:12
mostly very slowly in certain parts now we'll talk about some things that are
4:17
sort of consistent about every genre and just as but going back to that genre thing so
4:23
like epic novels long sweeping historical things like that readers expect them to unfold slower than other
4:29
novels when you hit a thriller for example just the title there will tell
4:34
you that most readers are going to expect a thriller to explode onto the page right at the first scene and then
4:41
continue to go very quickly so action type novels thrillers sometimes even
4:47
comedies can be very fast paced so a lot of urban fantasy will also be very fast paced romance readers have come to
4:53
expect usually a certain kind of pacing that is a mix between fast and slow so
4:59
it depends on what genre you're writing sometimes for example in horror authors
5:04
are gonna play around with pacing so they can build the anticipation for when that moment strikes that is going to
5:11
scare you and that's how they create fear in those novels is by playing with the pacing and in long gating how some
5:18
things unfold and explaining every tiny little detail about how the character is
5:23
reacting and what they're hearing and what they're seeing because that is going to immerse you into it and then
5:28
going faster just as your character's heart begins to erase so you can often play around with pacing depending on the
5:35
type of genre and I highly recommend to you that if you are just getting a handle on what pacing is and you want to
5:41
make it better in your own novel that what you need to do is find some comparable novels in the genre that
5:46
you're writing and read them with the specific eye on pacing how fast or slow
5:52
does the story unfold where does it begin to move faster and where does the author's take their time to really
5:59
elongate certain things so for example let's talk about romance what readers
6:05
will often expect with romances maybe you have a slightly slower pace as the
6:10
couple is getting to know each other they meet they start to form a relationship they go out there might be
6:15
some things where you're describing what the heroines doing and then you describe separately what the hero's doing and
6:20
they're not together and those things move a little bit slower because you know we're just getting to know those
6:26
characters but put them in a moment at the end of that first date where they're about have their very first kiss and suddenly
6:34
just the same way that your readers heart might start to race or your heroines hearts might start to race
6:41
wondering if he's going to kiss her the pacing also is going to pick up and you want readers to be turning those pages
6:46
very quickly to see if they do get that first kiss or not is this couple going to fall in love and how is it going to
6:52
happen and that can speed up the pace so when you get to the moments in your own novel where you want the pace to speed
6:59
up or slow down you need to pay attention to word choice and sentence structure and white space on the page so
7:05
we're gonna get down to that in just a moment but there's a couple things I want to cover first so before we get
7:10
into those word choices and sentence structure let's talk about the grand scheme of the novel and your overall
7:17
story structure and how that relates to pacing so when you think about pacing in your novel you need to be thinking about
7:23
the actual structure of your novel so what I'm talking about here of course is three-act structure most stories are put
7:30
together in a certain way so you've got the opening or the hook of the story and then somewhere around 25% into the novel
7:38
you're going to have the first climax this is also known as the doorway of no-return or it can be known as you know
7:45
the first plot point it depends on kind of what book you're reading or what structure you're following but almost
7:50
always there's a moment at the end of the first act which comes usually around
7:55
25% of your novel where you are going to have a climactic event that changes your
8:01
characters life forever it could be that first kiss in a romance in an urban
8:06
fantasy it could be a moment where your character discovers that vampires actually exist and it changes their life
8:12
because they're going through a doorway into a new world so depending on your genre the first act climax will look
8:19
very different but across all genres this is a very common thing to see is that climactic moment so when that
8:26
climax happens you can usually expect for the pace of your story to speed up
8:32
because this is a big moment this is something big happening in your character's life and you really want to
8:37
hook readers on to that page and keep them turning turning turning it's usually also action-oriented it could be that they
8:44
learn something new but it's going to feel very active for your character and for your reader the next big moment
8:51
where things are gonna speed up really big is that 50% of your novel where they hit what's known as the midpoint so this
8:58
midpoint moment is often where the entire story turns over on its head where you know you have what Alexandre
9:05
Sokoloff in her book screenwriting tricks for authors calls the now it's personal loss but this is the moment
9:11
where your character is really engaged in this story and there's no turning back again so it's a second doorway of no
9:17
return where your characters locked into the story and some kind of big thing happens and again when I say big I mean
9:24
big for your genre in some types of genres like certain types of romance or
9:29
those sweeping historical maybe the big thing is just a revelation or some kind of relationship in a thriller it's going
9:36
to be some kind of explosion or some kind of big deal in stories that are urban fantasy or fantasy world in some
9:43
way it's often going to be some kind of conflict or fight between the characters so you just need to know your genre well
9:49
enough to know what kind of moments happen at the midpoint but regardless of genre it's usually a place where pacing
9:55
tends to go very fast the next moment where we see this is often around 75% which is this kind of
10:02
final doorway or whatever the final clues are that start to lead into the climax of the story or what's known as
10:09
the dark night of the soul or the all's lost moment so this could be the moment where your characters are starting to
10:14
you know they've got their plan they've discovered their plan they've figured out all the things and now they're gonna
10:19
go in and put themselves into danger or whatever that final climax moment is in a romance it's something like the
10:26
declaration where your character finally realizes where they've messed up that they're gonna go for it it's like if you
10:32
think about when Harry Met Sally to pull an old movie out that some of you might not have seen when he realizes that he
10:38
wants to spend the rest of his life with her and he goes running on New Year's Eve and he's running the streets of New
10:43
York and can't find a cab that's what we're talking about about the climax of the story so everywhere from 75 percent
10:50
until you hit that climax moment where the resolution begins or the final battle that should all
10:56
fast-paced in your story according to the rules of your personal genre of what
11:01
you're writing so structurally you can plan this out basically you can structure your novel when you're
11:07
plotting it or if you're a panther and you just kind of fly by the seat of your pants when you're going back to do edits
11:13
you need to pay attention to where those climax tend to occur now in a movie you can almost time this by your watch so if
11:20
a movie is a hundred and twenty minutes long or two hours long 30 minutes in you're going to see that first act
11:27
climax you're going to see another big climax at one hour and then from an hour and a half all the way to the end of two
11:33
hours you're gonna see nonstop action usually or non-stop conflict and resolution so that's basically what you
11:39
can do in a movie novels can be a little bit different because as writers we have a little bit more leeway than they do
11:45
when they're when someone's visually watching something but some of the same rules apply if that first act drags out
11:52
for so so long and you don't get of your readers that climax moment around 25% in
11:59
let's say that you know you are writing a hundred thousand word novel that climax should be happening some kind of
12:05
action some kind of thing that turned your character's world upside down should be happening around twenty-five
12:10
thousand words into your book if it happens too soon like happens at 15,000
12:17
words then what might happen is you have too long of a stretch between that first climax and then maybe not having another
12:23
fast-paced moment or another climax until like 50,000 words in that could slow down your second act because you
12:30
want that consistent fast pacing that's going to keep readers turning pages and
12:35
keep them interested in your story so basically what I'm saying here is that the pacing of your novel is usually
12:40
faster at the beginning because you may start out slow and setting the atmosphere and setting the tone but
12:46
usually in the beginning of your novel you're gonna have something that hooks readers in and that is often known as the hook so it'll be something that's a
12:53
little bit more fast-paced that gets your readers attention and then around 25% in with that act1 climax it's gonna
13:01
be a little faster again then you're gonna see another really fast-paced at the midpoint or around 50% and then
13:07
again from about 75% until the end of the climax of your novel so those are
13:13
some moments structurally where you're traditionally going to see a more fast-paced things happening now of
13:19
course depending on your genre it may be fast-paced most of the time with little moments of like reaction or emotion and
13:26
all of that is going to depend on your genre that's why it's so important to understand what genre you're writing and
13:32
to read widely within that genre so one of the questions you might be asking is
13:37
how do I speed up the pacing in those moments within the novel well there are
13:43
a lot of tools that you can use in order to speed up your pacing one like I talked about the beginning of this video
13:48
is sentence structure or word choice so a lot of times when you're trying to
13:54
slow down the pacing you're going to have more of sweeping long paragraphs big chunks of description little very
14:02
little white space on the page because the reader is having to read this longer bit of text and a lot of times it's
14:09
including things that are not action-oriented they're things like descriptions or characters inner
14:14
monologue and things like that so on the opposite or flip side of that when you want to speed up your pacing you're
14:21
gonna want a lot of white space on the page you're going to want maybe even chopped sentences that aren't complete
14:27
sentences you might choose snappy or word choices that just sound like faster
14:33
or choppy so to speak instead of using really long sentences you're going to
14:38
shorten those sentences up instead of having dialogue that has a lot of dialogue tag and internal emotion and
14:45
description when you're trying to speed up your pacing you might have very short dialogue tags like he said or you know
14:51
he jumped over this or whatever so you're gonna just start truncating those sentences to a degree and every single
14:58
word choice you make can either speed up or slow down your pacing in this way so I'm going to just read a couple examples
15:05
for you from a short story that I just finished and these might not be perfect examples but it'll give you a little bit
15:11
of an idea so as part of atmospheric opening of this story I do a
15:17
little bit of description and on my page I don't have a lot of returns so it's a
15:22
lot of like you know send it five or six sentences per paragraph or at least three to four sentences per paragraph
15:28
which slows the pacing a bit so this is the opening of the story and you can hear the slowness of the pacing here I
15:36
barely have a minute to appreciate the satisfying spookiness of the old Victorian house at the top of the hill
15:43
the warm globe its lights shrouded in fog on this cool rainy night I stand
15:48
there anyway of course because I'm me and I can't resist a good haunted house it's a glorious sight to be honest the
15:55
full moon is nothing more than an eerie glow through the mist adding to the mystery of the house where a man went
16:00
insane a hundred years ago and killed half the guests who had come to a special ball to celebrate his wife's
16:06
birthday to this day no one really knows what happened but there are many people who think the souls of the 15
16:12
individuals who died that night still haunt the grounds of the estate so as you can see like some of these sentences
16:18
are like two full lines long they have a lot of extra phrases and conjunctions
16:25
and different things like that that are going to make them longer more sweeping sentences there's also a lot of
16:30
description there you're giving a back story of what happened at this house you're setting the scene of what this Victorian house looks like on a rainy
16:36
foggy night but later when I'm really wanting to pick up the pace just a
16:43
little bit if you can see this well I know you can't see my page so I'll see if I can pop in a little bit of a screen
16:50
grab here but now I'm returned hitting the return key every single line starts
16:56
something new at most every paragraph has maybe two sentences to it or two
17:01
lines and then there's another return which creates more white space and also gets readers zipping through it faster
17:07
and faster when they have long big paragraphs that don't have breaks and them readers tend to read it more slowly
17:13
because they're having to focus on every single line making sure they're tracking it correctly so when you have that white
17:19
space and you're hitting return and there's something happening in each line things naturally begin to move faster or
17:25
your pacing begins to speed up so here's what's happening in this scenario and you can maybe hear the
17:31
difference in word choices the difference in how long the sentences are and everything else maybe we'll see a
17:37
few ghosts tonight after all look I turn around my heart racing there's movement in the distance but
17:43
it's so dark and foggy that it's hard to make out what it is I quickly grabbed for my thermal camera and hit record
17:49
here hold this and take a few pictures if you can I say let me know if you see anything interesting a hand at the
17:55
camera to Seth and as his fingers brush mind chills run through my body the energy out here is insane I can hardly
18:01
believe this is happening someone is here I can feel it I say I grab the EVP recorder and slip my
18:08
headphones on hello I say clearly I'm Ella I just want to talk has anyone there I paused and listened but no one
18:14
answers hello is anyone there so in that little bit of a just a little
18:20
chunk of this story you can see where I have you know purposely sped up the
18:25
pacing and then taken one small moment if you noticed it as I was reading to
18:30
slow the pacing down for dramatic effect so as they're doing the action and moving things around and trying to
18:36
capture this ghost on the EVP and the thermal camera things are moving very quickly but then I specifically slow it
18:42
down here in this section a hand to the camera to Seth and as his fingers brush mine chills run through my body
18:48
that couple of sentences there is a slow or bit of pacing within the action to
18:55
highlight the reaction that she has when their fingers touch so it's a little bit of romance they're mixed in with the
19:01
action so hopefully you can see how you know I hit record I slipped my headphones on I grab this the word
19:06
choice matters in speeding up the pacing another thing you can do to speed up the pacing and I think I put an example here
19:13
oh it's in this one is what I call or what I've heard called the cymbal crash at the end of a chapter so when you get
19:20
to the end of a chapter what do you want readers to do you want them to turn the page and keep reading late into the
19:26
night so even if you've had kind of a slow paced chapter you really want that last moment of each chapter or each
19:33
scene to have a bit of a cymbal crash or a zinger or something that makes them think oh I got to know what happens next
19:39
if you want fast-paced novel that doesn't feel like it's going going going all the time but grips your readers a
19:45
lot of times you want to play around with those last few sentences or few moments of your chapter so that you keep
19:51
them you hook them in every single time or you have that cymbal crash that goes oh now I have to know what happens next
19:57
so just a small example of this in my short story she says you're a genius
20:04
like a fool I want to wrap my arms around him but I hold back so as not to look like a total crazy person come on I
20:10
say unable to hide my excitement let's go find some ghosts so maybe not the
20:15
biggest cymbal crash but I'm just pulling from a short story but it's that moment of ooh are they going to find
20:20
some ghosts I want to know if they find some ghosts they've got everything they've got a plan let's see what happens next and if you can end almost
20:27
every chapter of your novel in a moment that's like oh my gosh what happens next you're going to have readers turning
20:33
pages and ultimately if readers are turning pages and they can't put your story down they're going to want to buy
20:38
every story you write from then on so I wrote down a few different things that can make a difference in your pacing so
20:44
action of course the more things are actually happening physically happening or rapid-fire dialogue is another one
20:51
these kinds of things can speed up your pacing because readers are going to zip through it cuz they want to know what happens next what did they say next
20:58
what's happening with this argument so conflict action rapid-fire dialogue
21:03
those are surefire things that are going to make your pacing go faster unresolved questions this often plays to the cymbal
21:10
crash at the end of a scene so unresolved question is that dun dun dun moment or a new discovery dun dun dun
21:16
like you know this is what oh my gosh something just got revealed let's figure out what happens next or a new question
21:22
or something new comes to light that usually speeds up the pacing quite a bit another thing that can speed up pacing
21:29
when you're writing multiple POVs and this is something I absolutely love to play around with is jumping between
21:35
characters so if you have character a just is about to do something really
21:40
exciting and you leave it unresolved and then the next chapter they turn to has a different character you've kind of left
21:47
character a on little bit of a cliffhanger and you want to pull them into what's happening with character B so that they begin to care
21:53
about what's happening to character B and then just when you bring that second character up to some kind of climax or
21:59
discovery you switch yet again either to character C or back to character a and if you can do this you can often keep
22:07
people really interested in your story and keep the pacing up really fast now
22:12
the danger there which we can talk about when I do a video on how to write multiple POV is of course that if they
22:18
love what's happening to character and you keep switching to character B but character B's like somebody they don't like or they're not interested in that
22:24
person's story you might lose them because they're they get tired that you're switching between characters at these pivotal moments but if you do it
22:30
right and you write all of your characters interests as interesting characters with stuff going on and a lot of conflict
22:36
you're gonna keep them hooked shorter chapters can do this or shorter shorter scenes so if you have a lot of long
22:44
chapters where there's a lot of things happening it's very slow-paced but then you get into the meat of that first act
22:50
climax and you want to speed up your pacing make the chapter itself shorter you can also like I demonstrated make
22:56
the sentences shorter you snap your words that tend to flow over the brain or the tongue faster so all of these are
23:03
devices that you can use to speed up your pacing another thing like I mentioned is using white space so
23:09
hitting return more often instead of having big chunks of dialogue or description and another one that I think
23:15
is worth mentioning is using the active voice so I know there's a lot of stuff out there about using passive versus
23:22
active but when you're trying to speed up your pacing you want to use the active voice as much as possible so on
23:28
the flip side when you're trying to slow your pacing down because you want to highlight an emotion or highlight a
23:33
scene between two characters and kind of slow it down a little bit you're going on it going to want to use more
23:38
description more emotion more sometimes more passive it doesn't have to be more
23:44
passive but you can use things that are more passive in these moments also more internal dialogue more of your
23:50
character's thoughts and what's going on inside them and what their reaction is to things so since we're talking about
23:55
reaction let's go on to one of the final bits of this video which is talking about what Jack Beckham
24:01
calls scene and sequel you also might have heard as action and reaction but
24:07
these are pivotal moments in fiction that keep your characters feeling real but also helps to control the ebb and
24:14
flow of your story so for example if you have a scene of action something that happens and you don't give your
24:20
characters a moment to respond to it and react to it both physically and emotionally
24:26
your story might fall flat even though you have a lot of fun action in your story so what you want to do is you want
24:34
to have action or scene and then after every major scene you want to have a
24:39
moment that jak victim in his book seen in sequel which I'll link down below calls a sequel scene or what you might
24:45
hear in other writing courses called a reaction often there will be some kind of physical reaction and then there will
24:52
be an emotional reaction depending again on what type of genre you're writing this could just be a single sentence or
24:58
just a paragraph of reaction or it could be an entire couple of chapters of reaction so let's say for example your
25:06
character picks up the phone and he just gets this worse news that hey we had the killer but now he's gone and worse than
25:12
that he's killed again so you have that moment of action or that moment of you knows maybe a chase and now they're
25:18
calling the detective well the detective needs to have some kind of reaction to that so it might start off with a
25:23
physical reaction slams the phone down and throws his bourbon across the room but then he's going to need to have an
25:29
emotional reaction you'll hear in the fiction that he's like now his jaw is tense and his stomach is rolling from
25:36
you know wishing he hadn't had that last drink and you know his all of his muscles have grown tense and he's you
25:42
know got so much racing in his mind and he's angry and you see that in his you know in the writing about this character
25:48
so he's got that physical immediate reaction then he has some kind of emotional reaction then sometimes you're
25:54
also going to see as part of the reaction sequence you're going to see a plan so some kind of rebound of okay
26:01
I've now controlled my emotion and I'm coming up with what I'm going to do next so in that detective scenario you have
26:09
moment of action where he finds out that they didn't get the guy and that he's killed again he has a physical reaction
26:14
by throwing his drink he has the emotional reaction by showing his anger and feeling it deep in his body but then
26:21
he takes the deep breath and he thinks okay now what are we gonna do so he makes a decision that he's going to go
26:27
down to the scene of the crime he's going to investigate this newest murder so now he has a plan and this is often
26:34
how you will see scene and sequel or action and reaction play out in a story and that is vital to the pacing of your
26:42
story as well as being on par with whatever your genre is so in a romance
26:47
if a character's have their first kiss and then they park for the night you've got that action moment of the first kiss
26:54
but then you're gonna want to see the reaction so some of it might be physical like the girl goes skipping down the
27:00
street or the guy calls up his friend is very excited or he's like throws his arm up into the air however cheesy you want
27:07
it to be but then there's going to also be an emotional reaction and sometimes it could be excitement it could be
27:13
butterflies in the stomach or it could be fear of oh my gosh what have I just gotten myself into I just kissed the son
27:19
of my enemy you know whatever it happens to be I know these are TZ examples but you're usually going to have some kind
27:26
of action and then some kind of physical and emotional reaction and in romance you'll often see the emotional reaction
27:32
from both sides of the partnership be it male male female male whatever your romance is about basically this idea of
27:40
action and reaction balances your story out and balances your pacing so let's
27:45
just bring this all together with just a few final statements so to sum it up
27:51
pacing is how fast or slow your story unfolds or the speed at which your story
27:57
unfolds at certain points in your story like the beginning hook the 25% 50% 75%
28:04
or all of those act climaxes you should see an increase in pacing all the way through to the end of the final climax
28:11
there are certain ways that we discovered that you can use pacing to keep readers turning through those
28:18
stories like rapid fired dialogue more whitespace more active voice and shorter sentences then
28:24
you also want to think in terms of pacing your scene so that you have action and then your characters have
28:30
some kind of emotional and physical reaction to that so you've got the large grand scale structure and then it comes
28:36
down to scenes sequels and then individual sentences as well so

[Music]
hey everybody welcome back to heart
0:01
readings today I'm just going to go
0:04
ahead and record changing over my
0:06
travelers notebook notebook covers and
0:08
making new dashboards it's spring and
0:11
it's starting to be sunny outside and
0:12
the weather starting to change so I
0:14
thought it would just be it's just time
0:16
for a change I keep looking at all the
0:18
old dashboards and I just kind of want
0:20
something different this doesn't really
0:21
have to do with writing but since I was
0:23
doing it anyway and some people to ask
0:25
me about my travelers notebook I thought
0:27
I would go ahead and record this for you
0:28
today ok so what you're gonna need if
Materials
0:35
you want to cover your notebooks and
0:37
make dashboards for your travelers
0:39
notebook is you're going to need paper
0:41
that you want to cover both the
0:44
notebooks themselves if you have
0:46
notebooks that you'd like to cover and
0:48
you're going to need paper for the
0:50
dashboards themselves some scrapbook
0:53
paper this is mainly what I use a
0:55
scrapbook paper but some scrapbook paper
0:57
is double-sided so if you have things on
0:59
both sides then you don't really need to
1:02
have two sets of paper but most
1:04
scrapbook paper only has the color on
1:07
one side for example this paper that I
1:09
have here has the design on one side and
1:11
it's just plain and white on the other
1:12
so what I like to do is cut them so that
1:15
they're about the same size and then I
1:17
glue them together so it looks like it's
1:19
double-sided so you're gonna need enough
1:21
paper for the front and back of your
1:24
dashboard and if you have notebooks that
1:27
you'd like to cover you're going to need
1:28
paper for the notebooks as well you'll
1:30
also need a corner rounding tool if
1:33
you'd like to use a corner rounding tool
1:35
in rounder corners which I like the look
1:37
of that better you could also use
1:39
scissors to do that if you don't have a
1:40
tool like that so you need some scissors
1:43
of any kind you'll need a laminator and
1:45
some laminating sheets I am just using
1:48
Amazon's basics laminator that I got
1:52
from Amazon which I will link below and
1:54
just some leather pouches these are the
1:57
three milliliter
1:58
I have everything already pre-cut
2:00
because I happened to find a couple of
2:03
rolls of paper from my paper studio at
2:05
Hobby Lobby and if you see the price on
2:08
that these were a dollar fifty apiece
2:10
and they were actually an additional
2:11
like 20 percent off clearance
2:13
so I got these for just over $1 for an
2:15
entire roll of paper so I got both of
2:18
these patterns the pink and teal and
2:21
then the black floral so since they're
2:23
in a roll there really were rolled up so
2:26
I went ahead and cut those to size and
2:28
sort of tried to flatten them out over
2:31
the course of several days then I also
2:34
have this scrapbook paper that has a
2:37
little bit of sparkly shine to it
2:38
doesn't it isn't glittery where it will
2:40
come off on your fingers but it just has
2:42
a little bit of glitter to it I already
2:44
have one of my notebooks from last 90
2:47
days when I set it up for the new year
2:49
that is covered with this type of paper
2:51
so I'm going to leave this one covered
2:52
and everything else I'm going to change
2:54
all right so walking through the process
2:56
this is an a5 travelers notebook so I
2:59
want to cover the notebooks that I'm
3:02
using with a dashboard so that I can put
3:05
sticky notes or pictures or anything
3:07
else on it and I also have kind of a
3:09
protective cover for my notebook it also
3:11
just provides more decoration for the
3:12
notebook now in order to get a regular
3:17
size scrapbook sheet which is twelve by
3:19
twelve to fit over an a5 notebook and
3:22
have a little bit of space where it's
3:24
actually covering it completely you need
3:27
to cut it in the middle so instead of
3:29
just having a sheet of paper and cutting
3:31
the tops and bottoms and rounding the
3:33
corners and then running it through your
3:35
laminator you're going to find that it
3:37
comes up just a little bit too short so
3:39
what I like to do is I create a front
3:41
and a back for the dashboard and then I
3:44
just leave a little bit of space in
3:46
between so that it properly covers the
3:48
notebook I'm gonna go ahead and get
3:50
started on making the change from these
3:53
Hello Kitty dashboards and these others
3:55
that I made into these pretty florals so
Black Floral
3:59
the first one that I'm going to do I'm
4:00
going to do this black floral so I need
4:03
four sheets of paper I'm doing four
4:06
sheets because I'm gonna do front and
4:08
back of one side which will be the
4:10
outside on the inside and then front and
4:12
back of the actual back of the sheet and
4:14
then I'm going to combine these so all
4:16
I'm gonna do to start out with is I'm
4:18
going to take this tombow mono adhesive
4:21
and you can use any kind of adhesive
4:23
really and I'm going to
4:26
attach the front to the back
4:28
[Music]
Laminating
4:49
okay so now what I have is I have a
4:51
front and back for both sides of my
4:55
dashboard and as you can see this is
4:57
just a letter size laminator which is
5:00
probably the standard size so now you
5:02
can see why I can't put the entire a5
5:05
size thing inside this laminator see if
5:08
you can see it's too long so that's why
5:10
how to separate it into two different
5:12
pieces so I go ahead and put the first
5:14
side that I want to use into the
5:17
laminating sheet and anything that you
5:19
want to put on the inside of laminating
5:22
pouch needs to go ahead and go on before
5:25
you put it through the heat so I have a
5:28
few things from this kekeke a paper
5:31
lovers book that I thought would be kind
5:34
of fun to use on these pretty florals
5:37
so I just I'm going to very loosely
5:40
attach it where I want it to go this is
5:42
just one of the postcards they're from
5:44
inside so I'm going to kind of eyeball
5:47
where I want that to go centered and I'm
5:51
just going to attach it down I'm not too
5:53
worried about making it perfect in terms
5:55
of putting a lot of tape down because
5:58
the laminating cart is going to hold it
6:00
in I do like to put it on there so it
6:02
doesn't shift when I put it through the
6:04
laminator so then all I do is run it
6:07
through
6:08
so there we have the first part of the
6:11
sheet and I actually like to run it
6:13
through twice just because it seems to
6:16
not heat it up quite as much as I want
6:19
the first time through and I want to
6:20
make sure that that seal is really good
6:21
I also AM realizing that when I sent
6:23
that one through I forgot to round the
6:24
corner so I'm not going to round the
6:26
corners for the back piece but I will do
6:29
that on future pieces okay so while that
6:31
second piece is going through I'm going
6:34
to take my scissors and I'm going to cut
6:36
off the excess here on the sides now you
6:41
don't want to get too close to the
6:43
actual sheet of paper because if you get
6:45
really close you'll break the seal and
6:50
it will just come undone
6:52
[Music]
7:00
[Music]
7:04
okay so now I've done the same thing
Stickers
7:07
with some of the pink flowers I just
7:09
took a few stickers from the paper
7:10
lovers book and put them on here and
7:13
you'll see like some of this the edges
7:16
don't line up entirely great so what
7:18
I've tried to do and this is just flaw
7:20
and my own measuring and everything so
7:23
I'm not super precise when it comes to
7:25
that so I try what I try to do is make
7:27
sure that the side that's going to be
7:29
more visible is the one that's more
7:30
lined up and it's still going to be
7:34
because of the way I cut it a little bit
7:36
hard to get the edges perfect but I can
7:40
get it where you're really not going to
7:41
notice because this side that has a
7:43
little bit more white space showing is
7:45
really going to be tucked into the
7:47
center of the planner so you're not
7:50
going to see that as well so I'm going
7:52
to take the corner rounder and I'm going
7:54
to around the corners just a little bit
7:57
it doesn't take off much but it just
7:58
takes off that little tiny bit and then
8:00
just like the previous ones I'm going to
8:02
run these through the laminator oh I did
8:04
want to mention real quick before I run
8:05
these through that when you're doing
8:07
this sort of size you end up with a lot
8:09
of space on this laminating page that
8:12
isn't getting used so if you have
8:14
anything else that you've been meaning
8:16
to laminate this is a good time to kind
8:17
of pop those on like any die cuts or you
8:20
know little things that you cut out of a
8:22
magazine that you thought you might want
8:24
to laminate to keep this is a good way
8:27
to use that space for now I don't really
8:28
have anything that I want to do but it's
8:30
a good idea so that you're not wasting
8:33
that piece of laminating paper okay so
Tacking Tape
8:35
now that all my dashboard covers are
8:37
laminated and the excess pieces are cut
8:40
off what I'm going to do is I'm going to
8:42
take tacking tape and I'm going to use
8:46
the tape to be this Center thing that
8:50
holds it all together so if you can see
8:52
here on this edges the tape is what is
8:55
holding it together not a laminating
8:57
pouch I'm just gonna take one of these
8:58
and I'm going to show you real quick how
9:00
I did this so I have the front side and
9:05
then this will be the back side so what
9:08
I'm going to do is I'm going to set
9:09
these out just like this like pretty
9:11
close to each other
9:13
but just a little bit of space apart and
9:16
I'm trying to line up the bottoms of the
9:19
paper and the tops of the paper as much
9:21
as possible to get them even and then
9:24
I'm just going to pull out the tape and
9:26
I'm going to set it down right here on
9:28
the side
9:33
all right so once the first set of tape
9:35
is on I'm going to turn it around and
9:38
then I'm going to put a second piece of
9:39
tape here to really hold that booklet
9:42
together
9:44
so I just said all that tape in really
9:48
good and cut off the excess here at the
9:52
top and at the bottom and now I have my
10:03
dashboard you can do what you can to
10:06
sort of smooth out the tape so that you
10:09
can't really see that it's there which
10:11
will happen on its own over time as well
10:13
as it gets used but that creates your
10:17
dashboard and like I said don't worry
10:19
about these little pieces at least I
10:20
don't worry about those little pieces
10:22
that have just a little bit of access
10:24
there because once you put it over the
10:29
notebook and you slide it through the
10:31
travelers notebook and you have that
10:33
notebook there you don't really see that
10:35
inner part so much and you could always
10:38
cover it with washi or you could just do
10:40
a better job cutting your pieces in the
10:43
first place I just am NOT a super
10:45
perfectionist when it comes to that sort
10:46
of thing so I just don't sweat it but
10:49
it's totally up to you
10:50
so there's the first of my new
10:52
dashboards okay so for part 2 of turning
Changing Notebook Covers
10:56
you know changing out my travelers
10:57
notebook to something a little bit
10:59
different is to actually cover the
11:01
notebooks so if you have notebook covers
11:04
like you found notebooks for your
11:06
traveler's notebook that are beautiful
11:07
and you love them just as they are then
11:09
you could just slide your newly made
11:12
dashboards over the top of them and they
11:14
will be great if however you found
11:16
notebooks that you don't love the covers
11:18
on you can always change them so for
11:20
example these notebooks I'm absolutely
11:22
in love with because they're Tomo River
11:26
paper which is the same as my hobo
11:27
Nietzsche I love the way the paper feels
11:30
it's just they're incredible however as
11:32
you can see when I peel off the cover
11:35
that I made they come in these
11:37
undesirable colors they're very neutral
11:40
but they're dark tones like dark
11:42
burgundy or really dark grayish blue
11:45
they look very masculine to me and I
11:47
just don't like them because that would
11:48
not go at all with my pretty covers that
11:51
I've made and I like things to just be a
11:53
little more feminine so I went around
11:55
the corners and in the center and put
11:58
some of
11:58
tombow mono at removable adhesive on
12:01
them so that even if I wasn't finished
12:04
with the notebook which like this one
12:06
I've only used a few pages of so I
12:08
wouldn't want to trash it I can just
12:10
pull the cover off and I can replace it
12:13
and I can actually hold on to this cover
12:15
that I made out of scrapbook paper and
12:17
put it back on the notebook later if I
12:19
want to change it out so I will keep
12:21
that just put it in one of my drawers
12:22
and I make a new cover so I am switching
12:26
over all of my notebooks to this sort of
12:30
sparkly glitter scrapbook paper I got
12:33
this from just a block of scrapbook
12:35
paper that's where I get most of mine
12:37
Michaels will sometimes have huge blocks
12:39
of like a hundred sheets of scrapbook
12:41
paper for only you know five dollars if
12:43
you can get it on sale now what I could
12:44
do is I could just place the previous
12:46
cover on top of it and cut it out to
12:48
match exactly and I knew that it would
12:50
fit but if I was just starting out like
12:52
just in case you're just doing your
12:53
first one and I apologize for the
12:56
lighting you guys there's not really
12:57
much I can do I've just got all this
12:59
light coming in through this window
13:00
hopefully it'll be okay so basically
13:03
what I'll do is I would open up whatever
13:06
size notebook it is that I'm going to
13:08
use and I would do the best I can to
13:10
make sure that the paper is completely
13:15
covering up the red that I don't want to
13:18
see or whatever color cover I don't want
13:20
to see just barely so I want to make
13:23
sure it's covering it on all sides and
13:26
since this already has adhesive on it
13:28
it's a little bit tricky but once I get
13:32
it kind of lined up the way that I want
13:34
it to line up I will go ahead flip it
13:37
back over and I'm just going to cut off
13:39
the top excess
13:45
now you'll see I have not cut off this
13:48
extra side because if I were to just
13:50
pull this over there might not be enough
13:52
quite enough space it actually looks
13:53
like it would be fine but sometimes what
13:56
you want to do is you want to close the
13:57
notebook first make sure that you have
14:00
enough space because sometimes it would
14:03
be a little bit too tight and you need
14:04
to kind of open it up just a little bit
14:06
and then reposition the paper on top but
14:10
once you feel like you have a really
14:12
good fit then you can go back around and
14:14
cut off any of the excess paper just
14:16
trim that off
14:23
okay so then now I have a perfectly nice
14:27
and it looks like it was made for it
14:30
notebook cover that's gonna look really
14:32
nice inside my travelers notebook so now
14:34
I'm gonna put all these pieces together
14:35
and show you what my new travelers
14:37
notebook looks like so real quick I
Putting It All Together
14:39
forgot to mention that I am covering my
14:41
hobo Nietzsche as well and I'm just
14:43
gonna use that same black paper that I
14:46
used before I've already got it measured
14:47
out while I did was just measure it
14:49
according to the shape of the book and
14:52
I'm just gonna cover that real quick
14:54
[Music]
15:09
[Music]
15:20
so since this flap that I'm putting
15:23
inside the secretarial pocket tends to
15:26
get banged up a little bit more I like
15:29
to reinforce it with some washi tape
15:31
that coordinates with the color of the
15:34
cover
15:45
[Music]
15:47
okay so now I've got the hope in Ichi
15:50
Hubbard and I'm gonna put together my
15:53
new spring look for my travelers
15:54
notebook
15:56
[Music]
16:28
[Music]
16:43
[Music]
16:46
all right guys so there you have it this
Outro
16:48
is how I have transformed my same hobo
16:52
Nietzsche and travelers notebook into
16:54
sort of a brand new look and feel even
16:57
though all the things inside it are
16:59
exactly the same and if you're
17:01
interested in how I put some of these
17:02
other little embellishments on I know it
17:04
didn't walk you through that but these
17:06
are just like sticky notes that I just
17:09
took the like a few like a handful of
17:11
them and then put some of that adhesive
17:13
on the back and stuck them right on and
17:15
then I've got some little envelopes and
17:17
obviously like some pictures of my
17:20
husband and I I just stuck those on with
17:23
that removable adhesive so they're easy
17:24
to take off and it doesn't do any damage
17:26
to them but this is how you can turn
17:28
your current hobo nietzsche or your
17:31
current notebooks and traveler's
17:33
notebook into something fresh for spring
17:35
hope you guys enjoyed this and I hope
17:37
that you'll subscribe to my channel
17:38
alright I will see you guys in the next
17:39
video bye
hey writers welcome back to my channel
0:02
and if this is your first time here
0:03
welcome to heart breathing's and today
0:05
we are going to talk about how to get
0:07
started as a writer so I am bringing
0:14
this to you because I've had a lot of
0:15
questions lately from people on how do I
0:18
even get started people who are fans of
0:20
reading that have been fans of mine and
0:23
fans of lots of other great indie
0:24
authors and they're wondering how can I
0:26
get started in this career for myself
0:28
I've always wanted to write a book and
0:30
I'm really interested in learning how to
0:32
do it but when I sit down to write I
0:34
can't figure out how to put a story
0:36
together
0:36
well this is really common I mean when I
0:39
decided back in 2007 that I wanted to be
0:42
a writer I had only written a few
0:44
stories and some things that I had
0:46
submitted to some things in high school
0:48
and had written all through college I
0:50
had written a lot of poetry that's
0:52
pretty bad and will never be seen but
0:54
that's another story I had been an avid
0:57
reader since I was probably 7 or 8 years
0:59
old and I always wanted to write a story
1:02
but I focused on singing for my college
1:05
career and my graduate school career
1:07
when an opportunity presented itself to
1:09
me to quit my job teaching and learn to
1:12
write full-time I had no clue where to
1:15
start really I just knew hey I want to
1:18
tell a story and like a lot of people
1:19
who want to be writers I thought it was
1:22
gonna be a lot easier I mean I knew I
1:24
was gonna have to put a lot of time into
1:25
it I know it's gonna have to learn as I
1:27
go but at the same time I also naively
1:29
thought that you just sit down and you
1:32
start telling a story and it just comes
1:33
to you and that's all it is
1:35
but as I got further into the process of
1:38
learning to be a writer I understood
1:41
that there is a reason they call it a
1:43
craft there's a lot more to it than just
1:46
spitting a story out on the page now
1:49
there are a lot of people at various
1:51
levels who you know maybe intuitively
1:53
are able to put together a story that
1:55
makes sense and that follows rules and
1:57
that you know has great pacing and
1:59
characters just naturally and those
2:01
people I kind of hate them because it's
2:04
a lot easier for people that comes
2:06
naturally to but for the rest of us I
2:08
mean it does come naturally to some
2:10
extent but there was also so much that I
2:12
needed to
2:13
in terms of how to really craft that
2:16
story for it to be the very best that it
2:18
could be how to you know turn the story
2:20
exactly when it needed to be turned when
2:23
that first kiss should come when that
2:25
first battle should come and then how to
2:26
wrap up the story at the end and how how
2:28
to get from you know a lot of times I
2:30
knew where I want it to be at the
2:31
beginning and then I could see kind of
2:33
where it was going at the end but then
2:35
somewhere in the middle I was like I
2:36
have no idea what to do with this middle
2:39
part like what should happen the truth
2:41
is that there's nobody that's going to
2:42
tell you this is what should happen in
2:44
your story and once you really get to
2:46
the process of sitting down to write it
2:48
out yourself you start to understand oh
2:49
my gosh this is fully 100% my
2:52
responsibility to figure out what
2:55
happens in this story what what needs to
2:58
happen to these characters to get them
2:59
from one place to another and when
3:01
you're talking about the success of your
3:03
story long term whether it's still going
3:06
to be selling you know 10 years from now
3:08
or more it really comes down to how
3:10
well-written that story is how much it
3:12
resonates with other people how much
3:14
they understand and get what your
3:16
characters are going through they don't
3:17
necessarily have to love your characters
3:19
it depends on the genre but they do have
3:21
to understand where your characters are
3:23
going and they have to understand how
3:24
your characters got from point A to
3:26
point B and that is a really tough part
3:29
of storytelling so if you are new to
3:32
writing and you're not sure where to
3:34
start I'm gonna give you some of my top
3:36
tips for getting started as a writer one
3:38
tip is to read books on writing if you
3:42
sit down and you just expect that you're
3:44
magically going to understand how to
3:46
tell a story you are probably going to
3:48
spend a lot of time sitting at your
3:50
computer not knowing if the words are
3:52
any good if the story is going anywhere
3:54
important if it's all coming together or
3:57
not and when you're talking about a
3:59
higher novel you're talking about fifty
4:01
to a hundred something thousand words on
4:03
average think of it like this okay
4:06
writing is not brain surgery I know that
4:08
but it is still a craft a skill
4:11
something that you have to learn and you
4:12
have to hone and you have to really put
4:14
your time into learning how to do it so
4:17
you wouldn't for example just pick up
4:20
let's talk about another craft so you
4:23
wouldn't go and sit down at the piano
4:25
and
4:26
just expect to be able to open up a book
4:29
of music and begin writing it yes I know
4:31
that there are some people who can play
4:33
by ear so if they hear it they can sit
4:35
down and play it but those are like it's
4:36
super tiny percentage of our population
4:38
most people if they decided they wanted
4:41
to learn to play the piano they would go
4:43
through a process they would you know
4:46
find some easy music and they would
4:48
learn how to read music they would have
4:50
to figure out where the dots on the page
4:51
mean and how that corresponds to where
4:54
you put your fingers on the piano they
4:56
would probably get a teacher to teach
4:58
them how to play and to hold them
5:00
accountable for how well they're doing
5:02
and for whether they're missing notes
5:03
are not missing notes and then they
5:05
would practice because you can't just
5:07
sit down and start playing Rachmaninoff
5:10
if you have never ever read music before
5:12
in your life there's a process to
5:15
getting there and if you want to be the
5:16
next you know JK Rowling or Stephen King
5:19
or Jonathan Franzen you are going to
5:22
have to practice you're gonna have to
5:24
learn how to do it and you're gonna have
5:26
to get teachers along the way so that's
5:28
why I say read books on writing I can
5:31
link below some of my favorite books on
5:33
writing and I will also do a video in
5:36
the coming weeks that will talk about my
5:38
favorite books on writing but basically
5:40
if you just go to the library or your
5:42
local bookstore or go on to your
5:44
favorite eBook retailer and start
5:46
searching for books on writing you're
5:48
gonna find some great ones by people
5:50
like Donald Moss James Scott Bell K M
5:53
Weiland one of my favorite books is
5:56
called screenwriting tricks for authors
5:58
by Alexander Sokolov she used to be a
6:00
screenwriter and now she is an author
6:02
and so she has a lot of great
6:03
understanding of how to tell a story and
6:06
what that road map looks like and she
6:08
applies it to something that's a lot
6:10
easier to do in terms of you know if you
6:13
could sit down to read a novel to
6:14
analyze it it's not as as easy in terms
6:18
of figuring out what plot points are
6:20
being hit where because it takes you you
6:22
know 10 hours to read a novel but if you
6:24
sit down and you look at a movie it's
6:26
only going to take you an hour and a
6:27
half to two hours to look at that movie
6:29
and she gives you some specific tips on
6:31
here's what you're gonna see an Act one
6:33
here's what you're gonna see in Act two
6:35
at the midpoint you're gonna find this
6:36
here's what you might find at the end
6:38
like when they're storming the castle
6:39
and what I did when I first found Alek
6:41
Sokoloff and she came and spoke to my
6:43
local rwx chapter was I found that I sat
6:47
down and made a list of 10 movies that
6:49
were similar types of movies to the type
6:51
of heroine or the type of story I wanted
6:53
to write and I sat down with those
6:56
movies and a notebook and I would pause
6:58
it you know right at 25 minutes and be
7:00
like okay here's what happened at the
7:02
end of Act one and this is the going
7:04
through the doorway and I started to
7:05
analyze them and by doing that I started
7:07
to see okay it was like a light bulb
7:09
went up over my head that said okay this
7:11
is how you tell a story this is how you
7:14
twist and turn and control the pacing
7:16
then I started paying attention to
7:18
characters who had flawed backgrounds or
7:21
you know where heroic characters
7:23
following hero's journey and I started
7:25
paying attention to that character arc
7:27
and I still do that today when I go and
7:30
I watch a movie I will always kind of
7:32
think in the back of my head okay this
7:34
is the first doorway okay this is where
7:37
she meets her mentor okay I get it this
7:39
is the twist at the midpoint or this is
7:42
the first kiss or whatever and I start
7:44
to understand those posts that she talks
7:46
about that you can see in that book so
7:48
that's just an example there are also a
7:50
lot I mean there's just probably
7:51
hundreds if not thousands of books out
7:54
there on writing that are really great
7:55
and yes it takes time and I know that
7:58
you're ready to like get in there and
8:00
learn how to write and start practicing
8:01
what you should be doing that too but
8:03
it's so so important for you to start
8:05
reading books on how to craft a story
8:07
because your long-term success at this
8:09
and whether or not you spend hours
8:11
floundering at the keyboard thinking I
8:13
have no idea what happens next or you
8:15
get to finishing a novel and it doesn't
8:17
really flow well and people don't aren't
8:19
really following it and they drop off in
8:21
the first couple chapters because it's
8:22
not that interesting you're gonna wish
8:24
that you had spent the time upfront to
8:26
learn how to actually write just compare
8:29
it to sitting down at a piano and
8:30
immediately inviting people over to a
8:32
concert and you you're not playing any
8:35
music you're just staring at some sheet
8:36
music and like banging on the piano that
8:38
would not really be something a lot of
8:40
people would want to sit and listen to
8:41
you'd have people getting up and leaving
8:43
or shifting uncomfortably in their seat
8:45
and that's the way your readers are
8:46
gonna feel even if it's just your
8:48
husband that you
8:49
- that's the way they're going to feel
8:50
when you haven't put any time into
8:53
actually learning how to craft a good
8:55
story some of the elements that you may
8:57
want to study are plot this is one of
9:00
the big ones like figuring out how to
9:01
plot a story now there are some people
9:03
out there that we call Panthers who
9:06
don't necessarily plot their story out
9:08
ahead of time they follow the flow of
9:11
the story and then maybe afterward they
9:12
sort of rearrange it but they
9:14
intuitively understand how the plot
9:16
works so you may not necessarily need to
9:20
sit there and actually form an outline
9:22
if that's not your perfect process but
9:25
you still need to have a basic
9:26
understanding of how the plot of a story
9:27
is put together grammar is a big one if
9:32
your story is not readable yes there are
9:33
editors that can fix that for you for a
9:35
large amount of money and everyone
9:37
should use an editor but you can't count
9:39
on an editor to fix every single
9:42
sentence of every single piece of
9:44
writing that you put out there an editor
9:47
would take a look at someone who doesn't
9:48
understand basic grammar and they're
9:49
just gonna send it back to you because
9:50
it's not going to be worth their time
9:52
you need to make sure that you
9:53
understand the basics of sentence
9:55
structure comma placement you know
9:57
what's capitalized and what's not and as
9:59
you go you're gonna learn more about
10:01
that when you get feedback from your
10:03
editor but it should be really the best
10:05
that it can be before you send that out
10:06
a great book for that is The Elements of
10:08
Style by Strunk & white it's something
10:11
that I have dog-eared always sitting
10:12
next to me because it is super important
10:14
to understand the basics of grammar and
10:16
the basics of sentence structure pacing
10:19
how you pace a novel in terms of the
10:21
character arc and the events of the
10:23
novel that's super-important another one
10:26
of my favorite books his goal motivation
10:27
conflict by Deborah Dixon where she
10:29
talks about how you can weave into the
10:31
story not just the external plot but
10:34
also the internal plot that your
10:35
characters are going through what's
10:36
their goal was their external goal was
10:39
their internal goal what's their
10:40
external motivation for wanting that
10:42
goal and then what is the conflict
10:45
that's holding them back and you she
10:46
takes you through how to figure those
10:48
things out on a both an external and an
10:50
internal level this is another book that
10:52
extremely changed my writing and every
10:55
single time I sit down to write a new
10:56
story even if it's characters I've been
10:58
writing for years I always sit down and
11:00
figure out for this novel
11:02
where are they in terms of goal
11:04
motivation conflict both internal and
11:06
external so that's a great book to pick
11:07
up as well the second tip that I have
11:09
for you is to practice just like you
11:12
would sit down and practice that piano
11:13
every single afternoon you want to
11:15
actually practice your writing that may
11:18
mean that you might not end up with your
11:20
very first attempt writing a full-length
11:22
novel right away I didn't I started with
11:24
short stories because they seemed a
11:26
little bit easier so I didn't have to
11:27
worry as much about plotting out an
11:29
entire thing I just practiced like tone
11:31
of voice how does dialogue work how do
11:33
people talk to each other how can I get
11:35
characters out on the page and I spent
11:37
probably a year of my first attempts at
11:41
being author reading a ton of books and
11:43
also learning how to write and how my
11:46
own voice work what kind of stories did
11:48
my voice lend itself well to you know
11:51
just the practice of sitting down every
11:54
day now there are challenges out there
11:56
that will help you hit that practice
11:58
goal for example this month in April
12:00
there's something going on called camp
12:02
NaNoWriMo and if you haven't heard of
12:04
NaNoWriMo it's National Novel Writing
12:06
Month and it happens every November that
12:08
well over a couple hundred thousand
12:11
people across the world will sit down
12:13
with the challenge of trying to write
12:15
50,000 words in a month which is about
12:18
1667 words every single day of the month
12:21
and in the month of April and in the
12:24
month I believe of July they have these
12:26
camps where you can set your own goals
12:28
so if you missed this one which you
12:30
might have hit back in I believe it's
12:33
July it could be June but sometime this
12:35
summer there's another camp NaNoWriMo
12:37
and you can set your own goal so you
12:39
don't have to go 50,000 words you can
12:40
say this month I'm going to sit down I'm
12:42
going to write a 10,000 word short story
12:44
or I'm going to write the first three
12:45
chapters of my novel but you have that
12:47
accountability because you put that
12:49
number up on the website you have a
12:51
cabin that you join that's just a
12:52
virtual cabin like a virtual chatroom
12:54
and you can put in your words every
12:56
single day and talk to other people but
12:58
practicing your writing making time for
13:01
it and sitting down to write every
13:03
single day is crucial because same with
13:05
piano if you sat down and you practice
13:07
you know for two hours today and then
13:10
you didn't sit back down at that piano
13:11
for two more weeks
13:14
you're not going to have made any
13:15
progress
13:16
you're just going to be as bad as you
13:17
are today and actually maybe even worse
13:19
but if you sat down for every single day
13:21
for the next two weeks you would see
13:23
significant progress and how well you're
13:25
playing the piano and how fast and
13:26
quickly you're reading that music and
13:28
putting your hands on the page it's the
13:30
same with writing if you don't sit down
13:32
and practice you begin to get rusty you
13:34
begin to forget kind of how you wanted
13:36
to put those sentences together how what
13:38
was going on in the story you need to
13:40
stay connected to that story and to the
13:41
process of writing every single day
13:43
which brings me to my third tip which is
13:46
set time aside in your schedule for your
13:49
writing practice for me it's usually
13:51
between 9:00 and noon every single
13:54
morning I get my son off to school I sit
13:57
down I do some administrative tasks and
13:59
then by nine o'clock I am writing and I
14:01
try to write for at least two to three
14:03
hours every morning it's afternoon here
14:06
now and I have not done my writing yet
14:08
because I have not had a chance but I
14:10
will sit down this evening probably
14:12
between 9:00 p.m. and midnight since my
14:16
son will already be in bed and I will
14:17
enjoy the quiet time in the evening to
14:19
finish the writing that I needed to get
14:22
done today but I try to make sure that I
14:25
write every single day now I run a
14:27
challenge in a Facebook group that I
14:29
have that I say to them don't break the
14:32
chain which is something that came from
14:34
Jerry Seinfeld the comedian who he said
14:37
what he would do is he would tell a joke
14:39
he would write a joke every single day
14:40
and then at that point the only thing he
14:43
had to do was not break the chain and so
14:45
I've taken that you know certainly not
14:47
my concept but I've taken that concept
14:49
and applied it to writing that I try to
14:52
write or touch my story in some way
14:54
whether it's plotting or whether it's
14:56
you know researching or whether it's you
14:58
know working on something that my
15:00
character is going through that I can't
15:01
quite get right or editing or reading
15:03
back through or actually sitting down to
15:06
write the words I try to touch my
15:07
stories every single day so that I don't
15:09
get rusty it's just like you know an
15:12
athlete you have to do that work you
15:14
have to put in that work every single
15:15
day in order to see the progress in
15:17
order to keep your muscles so like your
15:20
writing muscles limber I don't know if
15:23
that's what you would say but it sounds
15:25
good
15:25
so make time for your writing daily so
15:27
that you can get that practice
15:28
and also you want to read authors that
15:31
you admire and watch film so that you
15:34
can begin to learn more about story and
15:36
I mean how great is it that you can
15:38
actually say hey I'm watching this movie
15:40
for my writing research so don't give me
15:42
a hard time like this is actual research
15:44
and it can be super fun so for example
15:47
if you are writing a zombie novel and
15:49
that's what you always wanted to do was
15:51
to write a novel about the zombie
15:53
apocalypse you could write down your top
15:55
ten movies about the zombie apocalypse
15:58
or it can also be just about apocalypse
16:01
in general something dystopian or where
16:03
the world is falling apart
16:04
and you can write down your top ten
16:06
movies and then watch them this is a
16:08
really great way to and again this comes
16:10
from Alexandre Sokoloff screenwriting
16:12
tricks for authors where she suggests
16:14
making that top ten list and then going
16:16
through it but this has helped me a lot
16:18
because in the course of a week you
16:20
could watch those ten movies and you
16:22
could start to really understand okay
16:24
what is common in the zombie apocalypse
16:26
genre what are the things that people
16:28
watching and reading and consuming this
16:30
genre expect to see so I make sure that
16:33
I have some of those elements in my own
16:35
story or I can play on those
16:37
expectations and twist it right when
16:39
they don't expect it like play around
16:41
with it like for example in a lot of
16:43
zombie apocalypse movies there's like a
16:45
group of survivors who are together and
16:47
someone has secretly been bitten and the
16:49
watcher knows that but the rest of the
16:51
group doesn't so you're waiting for that
16:53
moment when that person like turns into
16:56
a zombie and like starts killing
16:57
everybody so that adds tension to the
16:59
story so you see that in almost every
17:01
like zombie apocalypse survivor movie TV
17:05
show that you've ever seen before
17:07
somebody tries to hide the fact that
17:08
they've been bitten I played on that
17:10
sort of reader expectation of the zombie
17:13
apocalypse trope of somebody getting
17:15
bitten and hiding it from the group in
17:16
my own story but I twisted it in a
17:18
unique way so I'm playing with the
17:21
readers expectations in a fun way that
17:23
surprises them if you don't take the
17:25
time to understand what happens in that
17:27
genre normally then you wouldn't be able
17:29
to play on those expectations and you
17:30
wouldn't be able to twist new and fresh
17:32
things into your own story because you
17:33
honestly don't even know the other thing
17:36
is a lot of readers could pick up your
17:37
genre and be like this is you know it's
17:40
great to be unique and
17:42
tell a unique story but a lot of people
17:44
might be like but this doesn't have a
17:45
lot of the elements of zombie fiction
17:47
that I really enjoy and then they're not
17:49
gonna like your book as much so you
17:51
don't want to copycat other people but I
17:53
think that you really do need to have a
17:54
deep understanding of what's expected in
17:57
this type of genre what kind of things
17:59
happen in these types of stories movies
18:02
are a good way to do it but also reading
18:03
as much fiction in your chosen genre as
18:06
possible and if you don't know what
18:08
genre you want to write because you like
18:10
reading mysteries but you like reading
18:11
y-a and then you like reading epic
18:13
fantasy read a few of those and start
18:15
paying attention to them from a writer's
18:17
mind and thinking is this the kind of
18:20
thing I want to write when I'm reading
18:21
this do stories immediately come to my
18:23
mind and make me excited to tell them
18:25
ooh I would love to tell a story about a
18:26
girl who was meant to be the princess
18:28
but gets stolen away and kidnapped what
18:30
kind of thing starts to spark your
18:32
imagination and reading and watching
18:33
films that are in those chosen genres is
18:36
really going to help get you to that
18:37
point of imagination where you start to
18:39
see what lights you up and my final tip
18:42
is to get feedback from other writers
18:44
now it's all good my husband reads my
18:46
fiction so he does for sure become what
18:49
I would call my first reader my alpha
18:51
reader he does not get to see my rough
18:53
drafts because those are off-limits to
18:55
anyone because they're terrible but once
18:57
I've started editing the story and
18:59
bringing it together my husband's the
19:01
first one to read it and I incredibly
19:02
trust his opinion on it however passing
19:06
your book off - you know you're very
19:08
uninterested mother or your cousin who
19:11
doesn't read at all and just saying
19:13
please will you read this or your best
19:14
friend who is not a reader or doesn't
19:16
enjoy this genre at all and saying will
19:18
you give me feedback number one can be
19:20
putting them in a bad position because
19:22
if your writing is terrible you
19:24
definitely don't want to put them in a
19:25
position where they feel like they have
19:26
to just tell you it's amazing because
19:28
you want to get honest feedback
19:30
having someone throw your book back at
19:32
you and be like this is the best thing
19:33
I've ever read doesn't really do you any
19:35
favors it just makes you believe it's
19:38
like those people on American Idol sorry
19:40
to say who like go in there and they're
19:42
like my voice teacher told me I was
19:43
amazing and then they're like the worst
19:45
singer in the world don't be that writer
19:47
where you're passing your book off to
19:49
everyone and then you get upset when
19:51
they give you honest feedback where
19:52
they're like I really couldn't get
19:53
into this or I didn't understand it if
19:55
you hear that kind of feedback it might
19:56
hurt but you've got to get a tough skin
19:58
in this business because this is your
20:00
family telling you this just wait until
20:02
you put it up on Kindle and a bunch of
20:04
people who you don't know are going to
20:06
give you a lot of honest feedback and it
20:08
might not be so great because you are a
20:09
new writer and you still need to be
20:11
patient and put all that time in it's
20:14
important to open yourself up to
20:16
criticism that might not be hopefully it
20:19
will be kind but it might not be what
20:21
you wanted to hear because it can sound
20:23
great in your own mind but when other
20:25
people start to read it they might truly
20:27
have some criticism so I encourage you
20:29
that when you do get to the point where
20:31
you feel like you're ready to receive
20:32
feedback from people be it your cousin
20:35
or your best friend or an online
20:37
Facebook group or if you joined like a
20:39
local writers group whoever you tend to
20:42
get feedback from in the future open
20:44
your heart up to not taking it
20:46
personally but taking it as this is
20:48
where I need to improve and this is the
20:51
length let your ego step aside and say
20:54
okay this is where I need to improve
20:55
this is where I need to start really
20:58
learning and if they say gosh your
21:00
characters are just I'm just not getting
21:02
into their story well okay so maybe you
21:04
need to find some books now about how to
21:06
bring people you know how to write
21:08
better characters and how to bring
21:11
people into a story faster there are
21:13
lots of resources out there about that
21:16
sort of thing and then again you can
21:18
read some of your favorite books watch
21:19
your favorite movies and say okay this
21:21
is not necessarily a likeable character
21:23
but why is it that I'm so invested in
21:24
their story and a lot of times what
21:26
you're gonna find is that you're
21:27
invested in their story because there's
21:29
some sort of stakes out there like you
21:32
may not like her but she's got two
21:34
children and you want to make sure that
21:36
those kids are safe or this detective
21:38
might not be necessarily a likable guy
21:40
he might be a drunk he might be a loser
21:42
but you find out something sympathetic
21:45
about him immediately like he lost his
21:47
wife and children when he was stationed
21:50
in Afghanistan when he came home they
21:51
had been murdered well that's why he's a
21:53
drunk and a loser it's because he's been
21:55
through this trauma and now we have this
21:57
reason to be sympathetic to him and to
21:59
like him and to cheer him on but if you
22:01
just have the drunk and a loser and you
22:03
have no reason why he has like a wound
22:04
in his
22:05
or something that's made him like this a
22:07
lot of people are just not gonna like
22:09
reading about this guy who's a loser
22:10
so you got to learn how to create those
22:12
characters and how to create sympathy
22:14
for them how to give the readers a
22:16
reason to want to follow these
22:17
characters through the story and there
22:19
are lots of ways to do that but it's
22:21
going to take you time to learn so these
22:22
are my biggest tips on how to get
22:24
started if you're just learning to be a
22:26
writer but also let me say be patient
22:29
with yourself don't expect that you are
22:31
going to just jump into this and you're
22:34
going to have a novel ready in two weeks
22:36
and it's going to be ready to publish
22:37
because I can guarantee you that like
22:39
99.9% of people cannot sit down in two
22:42
weeks and write a novel that's going to
22:44
be a best-seller there may be exceptions
22:46
to that rule but I don't really know of
22:48
any most people it takes them years to
22:50
learn the craft of writing it's just
22:52
like I was talking about with the piano
22:54
or like if you wanted to be a Olympic
22:57
level ice skater like you cannot just
23:00
put on some skates and expect to go out
23:03
on the ice and immediately start doing
23:05
like quadruple Axel's or whatever it is
23:08
they do like that doesn't happen you may
23:10
you know put on your skates they may
23:12
feel awkward on your feet for a little
23:14
bit but you're going to go out there and
23:15
you're gonna take it slow and you're
23:16
gonna learn how to do it and maybe
23:18
you're gonna have a teacher which is
23:19
like the books I'm talking about the
23:20
critique partner so I'm talking about
23:22
and it's going to take you years
23:24
potentially to learn how to even get up
23:27
speed on the ice fast enough that you
23:29
could actually take off and do a you
23:32
know single lutz or i don't know it
23:34
could take you years to learn how to do
23:36
those things but it's worth it in the
23:38
end if you end up as an olympic athlete
23:40
or if you love it every single day that
23:42
you're working on it so what i highly
23:45
encourage you to do is understand that
23:46
if you truly want to be a writer
23:48
it's going to take you time it's going
23:50
to take dedication and it's going to
23:52
take patience it's going to take opening
23:54
yourself up to criticism it's going to
23:56
take really pushing your emotional self
23:59
to put everything on the page that you
24:01
can like as a writer you know we most of
24:05
us pour our emotions and our hearts and
24:07
our feelings about life into the page so
24:10
you're gonna have to open yourself up in
24:11
ways that you never really have before
24:13
for some of you but if you learn how to
24:15
write you take the time to study craft
24:18
get the books on writing read other
24:21
authors that you admire watch movies
24:22
that you admire so that you can watch
24:24
reader expectations viewer expectations
24:27
of genre and you set time aside in your
24:31
schedule and you practice every single
24:33
day or as often as you can then you are
24:35
slowly going to become the writer that
24:38
you always want it to be I encourage you
24:40
to give yourself that shot to not put
24:43
too much pressure on yourself to be this
24:45
amazing writer if you think that every
24:47
time you sit down at the keyboard you're
24:49
just gonna start writing you know
24:50
Hemingway or something you're going to
24:52
be disappointed probably in yourself
24:53
because it takes time it takes sometimes
24:57
like sitting down and working for hours
24:59
on one small scene or one small sentence
25:02
to get the words right and that's just
25:03
the process of being a writer so be
25:06
patient with yourself give yourself the
25:08
time and the opportunity to learn give
25:10
yourself the tools and the resources to
25:12
begin to learn how to be a better writer
25:14
but go for it you know you don't have to
25:17
worry about publishing right now there's
25:18
no deadline that says you have to be
25:21
published in the next six months or it's
25:22
not worth your time for me I started in
25:25
2007 in June of 2007 and I didn't
25:28
publish my first novel until October of
25:30
2010 and even now I go back and look at
25:33
that first novel and I see how new at
25:36
this I was and how far I've come in the
25:38
past you know eight years of writing
25:41
full-time and writing several books a
25:43
year it takes time it takes effort and
25:46
it's going to grow on its own as long as
25:48
you put in the time and the effort to
25:50
become a better writer but I wish you
25:53
all the best and I hope that if you have
25:55
gotten anything out of this video that
25:57
you will subscribe to get more tips on
25:59
how to organize your writing life and
26:01
how to and how to self publish and start
26:04
making money doing something that you
26:05
love but for now I highly encourage you
26:08
to just bask in the joy of trying
26:10
something new to enjoy the process and
26:13
to figure out what it is you truly love
26:15
about writing and what types of genre
26:17
you love to write because to me I think
26:19
sometimes there is nothing closer to
26:21
magic in this world than the way it
26:23
feels to figure out that story and to
26:26
tell those characters stories and
26:28
create something like worlds and people
26:30
that that others will begin to love and
26:33
you know follow their stories out of
26:35
nothing but your own imagination and
26:37
hard work it truly is magical and it is
26:40
so rewarding so I encourage you to put
26:42
the time in put the effort in dedicate
26:44
yourself to it and you can experience
26:46
that magic too
26:47

26:49

[Music]

hey guys welcome back to heart
0:01
breathing's I know many of you are
0:02
excited about this video because like me
0:05
you have a huge notebook collection and
0:08
you are looking for ways and ideas to
0:10
fill up those notebooks now I mentioned
0:12
in my last video where I showed you my
0:14
huge notebook collection that I would be
0:17
having a video for you today that is 30
0:20
ish ideas for how you can fill up a
0:22
notebook and also announcing my 2019
0:26
notebook challenge where I will be
0:27
challenging myself and any of you who
0:30
want to join me with filling up an
0:32
entire notebook every single month of
0:34
the year and also I will be giving away
0:36
one notebook every single month at least
0:39
one and I'm going to start that today
0:41
with two notebooks that I'm giving away
0:43
I'm going to be giving away this small
0:45
skiing notebook that's a pink kind of
0:48
composition sized moleskin notebook and
0:50
also this essential journal from
0:53
punctuate which is by Barnes & Noble if
0:56
you're interested in seeing the insides
0:57
of these you can go back and watch my
0:59
notebook haul video or like my notebook
1:01
collection video otherwise stay tuned
1:04
because we're going to talk about all
1:05
the great ways to fill this up and I'll
1:08
be giving you details on how to win
1:09
those notebooks okay guys so this is
1:16
gonna be really fun I'm basically I just
1:18
made a huge list of different ways to
1:21
use notebooks so I'm just gonna kind of
1:22
go through them and just briefly explain
1:24
what each of them are so here are some
1:27
ways that you can use your notebooks
1:29
number one use it as a plotting or
1:31
brainstorming notebook this is one of
Plotting/ Brainstorming
1:34
the things that I do most often with my
1:36
notebooks is I will dedicate a full
1:38
notebook to a story that I'm writing or
1:41
a series that I'm writing and I will
1:42
just jot down pretty much any idea so if
1:45
you're a writer like me this is a great
1:47
way to just brainstorm your books if
1:50
you're not a writer and you're watching
1:51
this this is probably one of the only
1:53
ones that won't like apply to you but
1:55
you can use it to brainstorm anything
1:57
brainstorm projects that you're working
1:58
on brainstorm series characters you can
2:01
do it for like have one notebook per
2:04
plot idea or you can have a bunch of
2:07
different ideas that you're thinking of
2:08
exploring and put them all into one
2:10
notebook number two morning pages I
2:12
talked about this in mind
Morning Pages
2:13
book collection video but if you're not
2:15
familiar with mourning pages Julia
2:17
Cameron wrote a book called the artists
2:19
way that I highly recommend you check
2:21
out if you are an artist or a creative
2:23
entrepreneur of some kind where she
2:25
discusses the practice of getting up
2:28
every morning and writing morning pages
2:30
and this is basically just a practice of
2:32
sitting down for like 15 full minutes
2:35
and just letting stream-of-consciousness
2:36
come out you can write creatively you
2:39
can write about what happened with your
2:40
mother yesterday you can write about
2:42
your hopes and dreams whatever it is
2:43
that naturally comes out but it's kind
2:45
of just this brain dump that you do
2:47
first thing in the morning which allows
2:49
yourself to like get these other things
2:51
out start creatively first thing in the
2:53
morning and you know be ready to be
2:56
actually creating something new when you
2:58
get done with them another idea is a
3:00
gratitude list so it is so common these
Gratitude List or Journal
3:04
days for us to get you know pulled into
3:06
this rat race of you know we've got to
3:08
do more we got a hustle we got to work
3:09
harder and we can get pulled into as
3:12
authors and entrepreneurs sales numbers
3:14
and house money going and all this kind
3:15
of stuff but really everybody on this
3:17
planet has things that are going wrong
3:19
and we can get sometimes like I found
3:21
when I was journaling a lot I was
3:23
journaling about all the things that
3:24
were going wrong and I just found myself
3:25
like getting sort of mired in negativity
3:28
so what I started doing instead was
3:31
keeping a gratitude journal which is
3:33
just basically every single night
3:35
sitting down and making a list of all
3:37
the things I'm grateful for I'm so
3:38
grateful for my husband I'm so grateful
3:40
for my sweet son that it took us years
3:42
to get into our lives and you know just
3:46
those kind of things that are more
3:47
meaningful and truly deep hearted and
3:49
then there's some days where it's like
3:51
some days you just have to write down
3:52
the simplest of things I'm so grateful
3:54
that it wasn't raining today whatever it
3:56
is but having a notebook full of your
3:59
gratitude and not allowing yourself to
4:00
be negative at all sometimes when you
4:02
feel down going back and flipping
4:04
through that gratitude journal can help
4:05
to lift your spirits plus just focusing
4:08
on the things that you're grateful for
4:09
and that you're happier for I think
4:10
makes for a more enjoyable life number
4:13
four a sticker journal so I will refer
Sticker Journal Check out The Modest Colink Below
4:16
to modest cats YouTube video or YouTube
4:20
channel on making a sticker journal and
4:22
I thought this was such a great idea
4:23
because a lot of us plan
4:25
and planner babes have a lot of stickers
4:28
sitting around the house that we love
4:31
but we just don't use that many stickers
4:33
in a day so she had this idea of
4:35
basically taking a notebook and making
4:38
it kind of like a memory journal where
4:40
you would just say kind of what happened
4:41
today but making a challenge to fill up
4:43
your notebook with your stickers that
4:45
you just haven't had a chance to use
4:47
stuff you've been holding on to where
4:48
it's like you've got sticker sheets they
4:50
use most of them but you haven't used
4:51
them all this is a way to get rid of all
4:53
those extra stickers so I'm going to
4:55
link down below to a video of from the
4:58
modest cat where she talks about her
4:59
sticker journal so idea number five is
5:01
to create a manifesting journal and I'm
Manifestation Journal / Scripting
5:04
gonna have a few ideas that are similar
5:06
to this but basically I have a
5:07
manifesting journal and this is
5:09
basically full of what I call scripting
5:11
if you're not familiar with this I will
5:13
also link down below to a another
5:16
youtuber that I follow that she talks
5:18
about how to script so if you're not
5:20
familiar with that you can check out her
5:21
channel because she explains it a lot
5:23
better than I do but it's basically the
5:24
process of writing things out as if they
5:28
were here and now as if this was the way
5:30
your life was now but including things
5:32
that you hope for in the future so like
5:35
instead of saying what your current
5:38
circumstances are you would say oh my
5:40
gosh I'm so excited about the $10,000
5:42
that got deposited into my account today
5:45
that's going to really help me to pay
5:47
off these bills and I can't wait to you
5:49
know go on that trip to Japan that I was
5:51
so looking forward to or you could even
5:53
say like if you were hoping to manifest
5:56
a ticket to a concert that you wanted to
5:58
go see you could include that in your
6:00
scripting and say oh my gosh
6:03
I am sitting here right now at this
6:04
concert that I really wanted to go to
6:06
the music is loud the lights are really
6:08
great the band is completely on point
6:11
tonight I'm wearing my favorite leather
6:13
jacket and the crowd is just so full of
6:15
energy and is so much fun to be here and
6:17
part of it is I mean I know it can sound
6:20
ridiculous to people that don't really
6:21
believe in manifesting or the law of
6:23
attraction but what it does is it gets
6:25
your vibration up and it gets you
6:27
thinking about actually experiencing
6:29
that thing and there are a lot of people
6:31
out there including me that believe that
6:32
when you start to get yourself in that
6:34
mindset where you believe it's possible
6:35
and you can see yourself in that
6:37
situation
6:37
you begin to attract opportunities into
6:40
your life so if you're into that kind of
6:42
thing think about a manifestation
6:43
journal where you write out all the
6:45
things you hope to achieve and even
6:47
write letters to yourself as if it is
6:49
currently happening and see what happens
6:51
in your own life idea number six is a
6:53
book review log so many of you I know
Book Review Log / Book Thoughts
6:56
are also not only writers but you're
6:59
also readers so if you have some books
7:01
that you read like a lot of books some
7:03
of us just keep this stuff on Goodreads
7:04
but as an author I don't like to put my
7:07
true thoughts about other people's books
7:09
sometimes especially if I didn't enjoy
7:10
them on to Goodreads where other people
7:12
can publicly read them because I don't
7:14
want to be the person criticizing
7:16
another author because we are kind of
7:18
all in this together and so I only want
7:20
to lift other authors up if you want to
7:22
keep your notes private and keep them
7:23
all in one place you could keep a list
7:26
of all the books you could even print
7:27
out a photo of the cover and tape it
7:29
into your journal and leave your own
7:31
like rating system and your own notes
7:33
about that book in your book review
7:35
notebook number seven research notes so
7:38
this is pretty easy but if you're
Research Notes
7:39
researching a certain kind of marketing
7:41
technique like Facebook ads or you're
7:43
researching you know a certain murder
7:45
that happened that you're going to pull
7:47
into your novel or something else any
7:49
kind of research that you're doing you
7:51
can keep notes of your research in your
7:53
notebook idea number eight is to keep
7:55
track of all your favorite quotes you
Favorite Quotes
7:57
could hand letter them you could write
7:59
them keep one quote to a page or you
8:02
could even tab out your notebook and say
8:04
these are my favorite quotes about time
8:06
management these are my favorite quotes
8:08
about being a writer these are my
8:10
favorite quotes about family these are
8:12
my favorite quotes about love and you
8:14
could put tabs on your notebook to keep
8:16
track of where each of those quotes are
8:18
and then just write them in your
8:19
notebook so number nine is a family
8:21
memories notebook I am currently using
Family Memories
8:23
an Erin Condren planner for this is like
8:25
a family memories keeper where I write
8:27
out like what maybe funny things my son
8:30
says or family jokes or different things
8:32
like that that we're doing as a group
8:34
also my husband and I play World of
8:35
Warcraft so I keep memories of you know
8:38
quests and dungeons that we did together
8:40
or levels we got or people we played
8:42
with so if you want to keep some kind of
8:44
family memories or gaming memories or
8:46
anything like that then that's another
8:49
good idea so idea number 10
8:50
is a recipes planner or a recipe
Recipes Keep Or Meal Ideas Notebook
8:53
notebook so so I know that like my mom
8:56
always used to have a card keeper like
8:58
keeping her recipes in cards and stuff
9:00
but I always hate to kind of handwrite
9:02
that stuff so what I started doing was
9:04
whenever I would find a recipe that I
9:06
really enjoyed I would just print it out
9:09
and paste it into a notebook and I just
9:11
kept that notebook you know separate I
9:13
also have used binders for this in the
9:15
past so it's just kind of whatever you
9:17
want but you could use like your
9:19
favorite recipes or like I'm doing
9:21
bright line eating which means that I
9:23
eat no sugar and no flour and I eat a
9:25
lot of vegetables every day so I took
9:28
one notebook and I made a list of like
9:30
all the combinations of vegetables that
9:31
I like all the different fruits that I
9:33
like so that when I'm going to do my
9:35
meal planning every week I have a
9:36
notebook full of ideas for meals and
9:39
different things that fall into my food
9:41
plan number eleven is lists now this is
9:44
probably one of the ways that you're
9:45
already using notebooks but it's kind of
9:48
just a easy way to use up your notebooks
9:50
making lists of movies you want to watch
9:52
games you want to play places you want
9:55
to go just tons of things that you maybe
9:57
want to do or experience in your life
9:59
you could also use up an entire notebook
10:01
with your grocery lists or your to-do
10:03
lists number twelve is meeting notes so
10:06
this year I talked about this a little
Meeting Notes
10:08
bit in my notebook and my planner one
10:10
but this year I used this Kate Spade
10:12
notebook for my meetings for a group I'm
10:15
in called freshly implemented with Amber
10:17
McHugh so I kept it here on my desk and
10:19
then every single time we would have a
10:21
meeting or anything like that I would
10:23
grab my washi tape take notes and also
10:27
all of my notes when it comes to those
10:29
meetings speedmaster mines and
10:31
everything having to do with freshly
10:32
implemented went into here so if you
10:34
have meetings on a regular basis even if
10:36
it's like meetings with friends where
10:38
you talk through plot or different
10:40
things like that or you're working on a
10:41
collaborative project it's great to have
10:43
a notebook dedicated to that so you
10:45
don't end up with like notes on this
10:46
random piece of paper and notes on a
10:48
different random piece of paper all over
10:50
the house you have them all in one place
10:52
idea number thirteen is marketing plans
10:54
or ideas for your series again this is
Marketing Plans & Ideas
10:56
another one that specifically for
10:58
authors but could go for anyone who is a
11:00
creative entrepreneur so if you have an
11:01
Etsy shop or anything like that
11:02
just
11:03
any kind of marketing plans that you may
11:05
have in the future like oh I think I'm
11:07
gonna put together these five books and
11:09
put them into a box set and I need to
11:10
get a cover for this and maybe in the
11:12
future I could do a spinoff on this
11:14
other thing so you're keeping all of
11:15
your marketing ideas all in one place
11:17
number 14 on a similar vein social media
11:20
plans and ideas so if you have an
Social Media Plans & Ideas
11:22
Instagram account or a YouTube channel
11:24
you could dedicate an entire notebook to
11:26
lists of ideas for your YouTube channel
11:29
or people you want to do collaborations
11:32
with or if you have an Instagram you
11:34
could make lists of types of photos that
11:36
you like or accounts that you like your
11:38
favorite hashtags and things like that
11:40
so you could keep your social media
11:41
plans all in one place number 15 is blog
11:44
posts ideas so this kind of goes
Blog Post Ideas
11:45
hand-in-hand with the YouTube ideas
11:47
notebook that if you have a blog
11:49
especially if you're blogging for your
11:51
readers and you're an author but anyone
11:53
who has a blog you could keep your blog
11:55
post ideas different keywords any kind
11:58
of research that you're doing on how to
11:59
set up your website or what colors you
12:01
use like I have sticky notes here that
12:03
have my little color code for my blog
12:07
branding so you could keep all of your
12:09
favorite color like what do they call
12:12
this like RGB numbers I forget but you
12:15
could keep track of all of that and log
12:16
it into a notebook so when I was putting
12:18
together my branding for heart
12:21
breathing's and all of my website stuff
12:23
and trying to get the pages separate and
12:24
figure out what like categories I wanted
12:26
to use I had an entire notebook
12:28
dedicated to putting my website together
12:30
so it's just another example number 16
12:32
is a fitness log this kind of speaks for
Fitness Log
12:34
itself but if you really wanted to like
12:36
start yoga or you really wanted to you
12:39
know be walking so many miles a day you
12:42
could keep kind of a fitness log or
12:44
fitness journal where you set down
12:46
everyday and you say here's what I got
12:47
done here's how it felt to do it track
12:50
your mood see if you're getting better
12:51
so if you're being more consistent so
12:53
there's another idea number 17 is a
12:55
gaming log so I talked about this a
Gaming Log
12:57
little bit earlier about like your
12:58
gaming memories but you could also keep
13:00
a gaming log not just for off you're
13:02
playing World of Warcraft but if you're
13:04
like me and you play games across
13:06
multiple platforms like you play games
13:08
on your phone but you also play games on
13:10
a console like a ps4 and you play PC
13:12
games like I made a list last year and I
13:14
had over 50 games on Steam
13:17
and ps4 that I purchased and have not
13:19
finished playing all the way through due
13:20
to not having enough time I started to
13:22
create a gaming log where I would love
13:25
what I was playing and whether I made it
13:26
all the way through and if I enjoyed the
13:28
game etc so there's another idea for you
13:30
number 18 is like reviews and thoughts
13:33
on movies and shows and you could also
Movies & Shows Tracker
13:35
track so if like for example if you
13:38
wanted to start watching a long show
13:40
like Supernatural which has like a
13:42
jillion seasons you could have you know
13:44
a section of your notebook that's for
13:46
season one and you can track which
13:48
episodes and mark them off once you've
13:50
watched them or cover them with a
13:51
sticker once you've watched each episode
13:53
of the season and you could leave notes
13:55
to kind of remind yourself like who is
13:57
the big bad in this one what was the
13:59
relationship between the brothers so you
14:00
could track series and you could also
14:03
track like movies that you watched and
14:05
whether you enjoyed them so number 19 is
14:07
a budget book for yourself and your
Budget Tracker
14:09
family so you could write down every
14:11
expense you could have a main budget on
14:13
your first part of your page where you
14:15
know exactly what's supposed to be going
14:16
in and out and then you could have a
14:18
page or a two-page spread for every
14:20
single week where you said here's what
14:21
we spent on groceries and you detailed
14:23
all of that out to see if you're still
14:25
on track for meeting your budget for
14:27
this year and it could help you maybe
14:28
save more money number 20 is a wish list
14:31
so this is kind of a fun one like if you
Wish Lists
14:34
have things that you know you want to
14:35
buy in the future but you only have you
14:38
know we just did the budget so maybe you
14:40
only have a budget of $50 a month that
14:42
you can spend on those kinds of things
14:44
and you want to start saving or you want
14:46
to make a wish list of all the cool
14:48
things you've watched in YouTube videos
14:49
or you've seen other people have and you
14:51
think oh I want a pack of those Sharpie
14:53
pens you could print out a picture of
14:55
them or you could draw a picture of them
14:56
or you could just write them into your
14:58
wish list notebook and you could keep a
14:59
wish list and then mark things off once
15:01
you achieve them but sometimes I find
15:03
like writing it down helps because you
15:05
may end up six months from now with like
15:07
a gift card somewhere and think oh what
15:09
was that thing I really really wanted
15:10
and now you can't remember so wish lists
15:12
are kind of cool to fill up especially
15:14
like little small notebooks number 21 is
15:17
a home-improvement wishlist and project
Home Improvement Manager for any project manager and ask lintal
15:19
tracker when we moved into our last
15:21
house it you know I had a project list
15:24
of things that I wanted to do like
15:25
painting this or you know setting up a
15:28
little sittings
15:29
over here are putting together an office
15:31
in this closet or reorganizing the
15:33
bookshelves so I had all these little
15:35
projects so it's kind of fun to put
15:36
together a notebook where you can
15:38
dedicate a few pages to all the little
15:40
tasks that need to get done for a
15:42
certain home-improvement project or you
15:44
really you could use that for any type
15:45
of project in your life like if you had
15:48
something that you do like you wanted to
15:50
knit a bunch of things for Christmas or
15:52
you wanted to hand make a bunch of crap
15:53
so you could use it in the same way
15:55
where you make lists of everything like
15:56
all the supplies you need to make or all
15:58
the projects that you need to research
16:01
or buy or whatever so just kind of a
16:04
project tracker but it works
16:06
particularly well for home improvement
16:07
stuff all right
16:08
idea number 22 I don't find this to be
16:10
as useful because I like to keep this on
Address Book
16:13
digital but some of you may find it
16:15
useful and it was just an idea that
16:16
popped into my head was you can use a
16:18
notebook for an address book to keep
16:21
track of all of your addresses of course
16:23
it would be nice to have like an
16:24
official address book that already had
16:25
some things written in but if you're
16:27
just looking for ways to fill up your
16:28
notebooks you might want to keep track
16:30
of all your addresses when you send
16:32
birthday cards that sort of thing who
16:34
you're sending Christmas cards to and
16:35
everything else so having that all on
16:37
paper might be something that you really
16:39
enjoy number 23 is to keep vision boards
16:42
so I am huge on keeping vision boards
Vision Boards
16:45
that I even put one inside my hv9 D
16:47
planner because I like to redo my vision
16:49
board every quarter with pictures of the
16:51
things I'm trying to achieve in my life
16:52
because visualization is a big part of
16:55
success for me so having a vision board
16:58
as a notebook this goes back kind of
17:00
similar to like I said the manifestation
17:02
journal but you could keep a notebook
17:04
that was full of images of all the
17:07
things you want to achieve in your life
17:09
and what you could do is you could put
17:11
it all on one big page or you could put
17:14
like each individual thing like let's
17:16
say you really want to be a USA Today
17:18
bestseller you could put you know print
17:20
out a copy of the newspaper heading put
17:23
it at the top of one page and then write
17:25
down why you want to achieve that goal
17:26
if you have a deadline for when you want
17:28
to achieve it and so on and then the
17:30
next page could be you know your next
17:32
big goal which is to complete a series
17:34
similar to Twilight or you know whatever
17:37
so you've got all these different things
17:39
or like someday I want to have
17:41
movie deal so you put a bunch of
17:42
pictures of other movies that were made
17:44
from books that you loved and write out
17:46
what how it would feel to achieve that
17:48
someday so it could be like an entire
17:50
notebook for you that is a vision board
17:52
idea number 24 is hand lettering
Hand-Lettering Practice
17:55
practice raise your hand if you are out
17:57
there and you are jealous of all these
17:59
people who can do amazing hand lettering
18:01
with their like dual brush pens and just
18:05
any kind of brush pens I am so jealous
18:07
and I would really really love to have
18:09
beautiful handwriting and hand lettering
18:11
so that I could do more with like my
18:14
bullet journal or with my planner in
18:17
general or even just my notes I am
18:19
trying in 2019 to get better I have done
18:22
some practicing but I am not really
18:24
great at hand lettering so you could
18:26
dedicate an entire notebook to
18:28
practicing hand lettering and you could
18:30
just practice the basics and over and
18:32
over and over again or you could
18:34
practice different quotes or different
18:35
phrases and different embellishments and
18:37
stuff like that and you could fill up an
18:38
entire notebook pretty easily with that
18:40
along those same lines number 25 is
18:43
doodling practice so I am also not a
Doodling Practice
18:45
great artist or a great person who draws
18:48
but I really really want to get better
18:50
at sort of like doodling things into my
18:53
planner anything you want to get better
18:54
at it is good to practice so you could
18:57
fill an entire notebook with your
18:58
doodles and your practices like you're
19:00
just going over them over and over and
19:02
over again until you get better and then
19:04
you also have a record all in one
19:06
notebook of how much better you got from
19:08
the beginning of starting to try to the
19:10
end number 26 is course notes so if
Course Notes
19:14
you're like me you're a course junkie
19:16
you like to take different kinds of
19:17
courses I've taken courses on you know
19:19
how to do bright line eating I took a
19:21
bootcamp on that all the way over to I'm
19:23
taking a course now called the blog tube
19:25
is hive and you know everything in
19:28
between so if you are into courses then
19:30
you could create a course notebook where
19:32
you keep all of your notes that you take
19:34
while you're taking the course idea
19:36
number 27 is in a similar vein your book
Book Notes
19:40
notes and this is not the same thing as
19:42
book reviews but what I'm talking about
19:44
here is like I am constantly reading new
19:47
books on craft so I'm always reading
19:49
books on how to be a better writer like
19:51
how to write a really good mystery how
19:52
to plot my books better
19:55
how to have better character arcs how to
19:56
write better setting or better dialogue
19:59
so I'm always looking for new books and
20:01
I try to read at least four or five new
20:03
craft books or marketing books that have
20:05
to do with my business as a writer every
20:07
single year so when I'm reading like on
20:09
my phone I will often highlight the
20:11
phrases that I like but I am much less
20:14
likely to go back into an e-book like an
20:16
old ebook and look up the highlights
20:18
than I am to go into a notebook that's
20:20
sitting on my desk and look up the
20:22
highlights so sometimes what I will do
20:24
when I'm reading those craft books is I
20:26
will take notes so if you're doing
20:27
anything that's like nonfiction you're
20:29
trying to improve yourself in some way
20:31
or approve your knowledge in some way
20:32
you can dedicate an entire notebook to
20:34
all the different books that you've been
20:36
reading on this sort of thing that so
20:38
that's idea number 27 number 28 is a
20:41
dream log so I don't know about you but
Dream Log
20:43
I have vivid dreams and I have always
20:46
wanted to remember my dreams and I
20:48
remember Alex Sokoloff who is a fellow
20:50
writer and screenwriter said that if you
20:54
train yourself that you can train
20:56
yourself to remember your dreams if you
20:57
get up every morning and write down what
20:59
you remembered it will flip something in
21:00
your brain that says remember your
21:02
dreams remember your dreams and I always
21:05
thought this was a cool idea so you
21:06
could keep a small notebook by your bed
21:08
and then every morning when you get up
21:09
you could record your dreams like a
21:11
dream log and train yourself over time
21:13
to really in detail remember what you
21:15
dreamed number 29 is a health or mood
Health/Mood Log
21:19
log which is different from the fitness
21:20
log but kind of similar so if you are
21:22
battling depression or you've been
21:24
trying to like raise your mood raise
21:26
your vibration and raise the way that
21:28
you feel on a you know daily weekly
21:30
monthly like lifetime basis you just
21:32
want to feel better or be more mindful
21:34
then you could keep a health journal and
21:37
that's just very simple that you say
21:39
like every single day this is how it was
21:41
feeling you know maybe you could have a
21:43
little like color code if you say this
21:46
this kind of was my mood today was like
21:48
gray because I wasn't feeling very good
21:49
or it was like bright yellow because I
21:51
was super happy all day and you could
21:53
come up with your own color code I know
21:54
a lot of people do sort of like a mood
21:56
tracker in the bullet journal so you
21:57
could dedicate an entire notebook to
21:59
this if you were really trying to work
22:00
on this in your life number 30 you could
22:02
keep a daily writing prompt notebook so
Daily Writing Prompts
22:05
you could actually write in your
22:07
notebook
22:07
looks like write your fiction in your
22:10
notebooks and I actually know several
22:12
authors who don't type out their novels
22:14
they handwrite their entire novels I
22:16
don't know how they do it without
22:17
getting major hand cramps but for them
22:19
there's just something about putting
22:20
that pen to paper that feels really good
22:22
so if you wanted to hone your skill as a
22:24
writer or just as a creative you could
22:26
pick a daily writing prompt from a
22:28
website or from somewhere online or just
22:31
make one up and write one at the top of
22:32
the page for every single day and you
22:34
could just write that out so any kind of
22:35
daily writing prompts to get your
22:37
creative juices flowing so to speak to
22:39
left so number 31 is a donation log so
22:43
we donate especially because we moved in
Donation Log
22:46
the last couple of years we donated
22:47
truckloads full of stuff like our
22:49
Christmas tree lots of boots I also lost
22:52
50 pounds last year so I donated bags
22:55
and bags of clothes so when you are
22:57
donating stuff a lot of times if if you
22:59
don't know this if you're an
23:01
entrepreneur and you're like
23:02
self-employed person a lot of times when
23:04
you claim donations and stuff like that
23:06
if you get audited they want to see more
23:08
than just that donation slip you know
23:10
they want a detailed list of what you
23:12
donated so like they want to see a list
23:14
this as I donated five shirts two
23:16
jackets you know ten notebooks computer
23:20
mouse and keyboard etc and so you could
23:22
keep a donation log and this might last
23:25
you several years depending on how often
23:26
you take things to donate but then you
23:29
would always have those records there in
23:31
case you got audited or in case you
23:33
needed a record of the things that you
23:34
donated and how much they were worth
23:36
idea number thirty-two is an idea
Idea "Parking Lot"
23:39
parking lot so I mentioned that I'm in
23:41
this freshly implemented group with
23:43
Amber McHugh she is amazing if you're
23:45
not familiar with her I'm gonna include
23:46
a link down below to her yearly plan
23:48
Athan which is a big thing where
23:51
everybody gets ready for 2019 or
23:53
whatever the next year is and I've
23:54
participated in this for a couple of
23:56
years there's a lot of great stuff and
23:58
if you haven't done this it's a free
23:59
Facebook group with tons of great videos
24:01
and stuff so I believe all the videos
24:04
are still available even though the
24:06
planets on took place like a couple
24:07
months ago so I'm gonna link that down
24:09
below in case you want to check it out
24:10
but amber McHugh is like I super love
24:12
her she's helped me a lot in my own
24:14
business and she has this saying about
24:16
the million dollar parking lot or your
24:18
idea park
24:20
which is you know you can't work on it
24:22
right now but it's something that you
24:23
want to potentially remember that you
24:26
might want to do later so it's like
24:28
maybe you can't create a mastermind now
24:30
or a huge Facebook group of people that
24:32
sprint together every you know 30
24:34
minutes or whatever but you want to do
24:36
it someday so you put it into your idea
24:37
parking lot so you could dedicate an
24:39
entire notebook to ideas that you would
24:41
like to pursue in the future okay guys
24:44
that is 32 ideas for you on how to fill
24:47
up your notebooks and of course there's
24:48
just the basic one of you can use your
24:50
notebook to journal your thoughts and
24:52
feelings every single day just like a
24:54
diary so I guess that's the thirty-third
24:55
but that's probably the most common way
24:58
that I use it I hope that you have
24:59
enjoyed these tips if you did please
25:01
comment below and let me know not only
25:03
which one of these tips you think you're
25:05
thinking about trying that you hadn't
25:06
thought of before
25:07
but also if you have any other ideas of
25:10
how to use journals or how you've used
25:12
your notebooks up in the past that I did
25:14
not mention so please keep the love
25:16
going keep the ideas going down below
25:17
because I saw a lot of comments on that
25:20
video the other day about all my
25:22
notebooks that I've been hoarding from a
25:23
lot of you that said you also have a ton
25:26
of notebooks that you have not used up
25:27
so let's get all those ideas flowing now
25:30
moving on to my notebook challenge and
25:33
giveaway here are the details in 2019
25:36
starting right there on January 1st I'm
25:38
going to select one notebook from my
25:40
collection that I will be completely
25:43
filling up over the course of that month
25:45
I don't know exactly what I'm gonna do
25:47
to fill it up I may change it up and say
25:49
this month I'm gonna use it as a book
25:51
log or my notes on research and then
25:53
next month I'm gonna use one that's just
25:55
journaling or a manifestation journal so
25:57
I might switch it up every single month
26:00
and I'll let you know but I'm gonna be
26:01

26:50
notebooks that we have not to give you
26:52
an excuse to go and buy brand new
26:54
notebooks however if you don't have any
26:55
notebooks at your home maybe you can
26:58
either win one for me or go and treat
27:00
yourself to a notebook so that you can
27:01
join in this challenge of filling up a
27:03
notebook every single month and if you
27:05
know gosh you're just not going to be
27:08
able to fill up a notebook like
27:09
especially the longer ones like a 200
27:11
page journal you know you're not gonna
27:13
have time to fill it up then you can
27:14
alter the challenge for yourself and say
27:16
I'm gonna dedicate myself to filling up
27:18
at least two notebooks next year or at
27:20
least three notebooks next year or one
27:22
notebook every three months but make up
27:24
the rules for yourself you can join the
27:26
challenge either way and will keep up
27:28
with each other along the year
27:30
throughout 2019 I'm kind of excited
27:32
about it because I have all these
27:34
beautiful notebooks I haven't been able
27:35
to use and I'm gonna finally be using
27:37
them so if you're joining me let me know
27:39

27:49
separate notebook giveaways and so we've
27:53

this contest is open internationally I
28:34
can't promise that every single one next
28:36
year will be open internationally
28:37

28:41
overseas
28:42
but I don't want to leave out my
28:43

hello everyone welcome back to heart
0:01
breathing today it's part four of my
0:03
series on how to edit your novel and
0:05
we're gonna be talking about some of my
0:07
favorite books on editing so yeah you've
0:14
made it to what will be the shortest
0:16
video hopefully of this entire series so
0:19
far we've talked about how to self edit
0:21
your novel what are the different types
0:23
of editors we've talked about questions
0:25
answering questions about beta readers
0:27
and everything there so now let's talk
0:29
about some of the best books on editing
0:31
just like books on plotting there is
0:34
just a huge pile of books on how to edit
0:39
your novel and you don't want to skip
0:42
the books on plotting and craft because
0:44
really you'll need less editing and
0:47
you'll understand story structure and
0:49
how to write dialogue and all that so
0:51
much better if you study the just the
0:53
regular craft books anyway so if you go
0:56
back to my guide on how to plot your
0:59
novel you'll see some of my favorite
1:00
books on plotting and craft and that
1:02
sort of thing and the list goes on but
1:04
let's talk specifically about books I
1:07
like what I'm getting into the editing
1:09
process and books that helped me to edit
1:11
my own books better so one of my
Self Editing For Fiction Writers
1:14
favorites
1:15
that I still have in hardcopy here is
1:17
self editing for fiction writers and
1:20
this is kind of a standard I'm not sure
1:22
when this came out but it's been more
1:24
than a decade ago this is by Rini Brown
1:26
and Dave King I have the second edition
1:29
I'm not sure if there's been a new
1:30
edition published but I've had this one
1:32
for a long time this book is just one of
1:35
those that's really great for taking an
1:38
editors perspective and helping you to
1:40
self edit so this is some of that copy
1:42
edit line edit type stuff that you'll
1:45
get you get chapters on characterization
1:48
exposition point of view inner monologue
1:52
voice setting that sort of thing plus it
1:55
talks about how to cut your passages
1:58
down and it gives you some very specific
1:59
examples of how to take a certain
2:02
passage and make it better so they'll
2:04
give you some examples and you can kind
2:06
of see how an editor would work through
2:08
some examples and some sample writing so
2:11
I found that very helpful as a beginning
2:13
on editing so if you're looking for
2:15
something that's kind of one of the
2:17
staples I would say definitely pick up
2:19
self editing for fiction writers another
The Elements of Style
2:22
book and I'm sorry I don't actually have
2:24
all of these to just hold it up and show
2:27
you because as some of you know I am in
2:29
the middle of packing because we are
2:30
moving to a new house in just a couple
2:33
of weeks so a lot of my books have
2:34
already been packed up but you can find
2:37
these very easily online and I will have
2:38
links to the books down below as well as
2:41
there are links and a list of these
2:43
books in my editing guide if you have
2:45
not downloaded the free editing guide
2:47
workbook that I put together for you
2:49
guys that will go with this whole series
2:52
you can get that over on my website at
2:55
heart breathing's calm / how to edit
2:58
your novel I'll have the link for you
3:00
down below or you can go to heart
3:02
breathing's calm slash blog or today's
3:04
blog post and that link will be there
3:07
for you as well to join my mailing list
3:09
so the second sort of basic must-have
3:12
book that I feel like every writer
3:13
should have in their library of books is
3:17
the super super classic Strunk and white
3:21
The Elements of Style this is very much
3:24
a handbook for how to use commas all of
3:28
those like grammar type questions that
3:31
you have it goes very much into the
3:32
mechanics of things this book was vital
3:35
to me when I was learning to write not
3:37
only when I am editing now and I want to
3:39
go back there are so many times that I
3:41
have gone back to reference that to
3:43
figure out like do I need a comment here
3:44
or not so like all of those questions
3:47
about right use of apostrophes commas
3:49
dialogue tags all of those like
3:51
mechanical things most people for
3:54
fiction use the Chicago Manual of style
3:55
and this Elements of Style really goes
3:58
into all the how to's apply it and it
4:01
gives you lots of just practical
4:03
examples it's a very thin little book it
4:05
doesn't cost that much you can get it in
4:07
your library but I highly recommend that
4:09
you buy a physical copy of it for your
4:11
personal library and dog-ear those pages
4:14
or put a little page flag in those pages
4:17
that are like the comma rules or
4:19
apostrophe rules or with our grammar
4:21
type rules that you tend to struggle
4:23
with so that you can go back and
4:25
just read and refresh this they're just
4:28
it's just an important one to have so
4:29
The Elements of Style is a must-have for
4:31
all writers I've got to mention one of
4:33
my favorite craft writers of all time
4:35
I've read most of his books if not all
4:37
of them with just James Scott Bell he's
4:39
just amazing and he has a book on
4:42
editing that is called revision and hold
4:45
on revision and self editing for
4:47
publication this is also a gold mine it
4:50
talks about similar types of things that
4:52
you see in self editing for fiction
4:54
writers but I just love his style of
4:56
teaching and he gets a very practical
4:58
advice so this is another really good
5:00
one you may not even need to pick up
5:03
both self editing for fiction writers
5:05
and revision and self editing for
5:07
publication you could just pick one or
5:09
the other that appeals to you if you go
5:10
and you look at both of them like in the
5:12
bookstore or at the library you might
5:14
not need both of them because they're
5:16
very similar kind of books just with a
5:17
different style but I wanted to mention
5:20
James Scott Bell's version of it because
5:22
even though self editing for fiction
5:24
writers was the first one I picked up
5:25
years ago when I started writing I do
5:28
enjoy James Scott Bell's book and pretty
5:30
much anything he's written on crafts is
5:32
worth a look another one that I own in
Emotion Thesaurus
5:35
both PDF form when they first put this
5:38
out on their blog and I also have now a
5:41
paper but paperback copy of it is the
5:44
emotion thesaurus and this is by I
5:47
always get their names wrong this is by
5:49
Becca Puglisi I don't know if I'm saying
5:51
that correctly and Angela Ackerman and
5:54
they had a really great website they
5:57
probably still have it and I can't
5:58
remember what it is now so if you
6:00
remember comment down below and let me
6:01
know where they started basically
6:03
blogging about these sort of things like
6:06
different ways to explain or to express
6:09
anger and so then they would say the
6:11
emotion of anger and they would give you
6:14
all these examples of how you see anger
6:17
because we hear it as writers all the
6:18
time show don't tell so how do you show
6:21
anger other than just saying he was
6:23
angry or he was filled with rage so now
6:25
they give you all these different ways
6:28
to explain it not only the way it feels
6:30
on the inside if you're angry but also
6:32
the way it physically manifests like his
6:34
cheeks or his you know red traveled up
6:37
his you know neck
6:38
or whatever I wish I had it out but I
6:41
know I've already packed this one to
6:42
give you better examples than what I can
6:44
just come up with when I'm trying to
6:45
talk about it
6:46
but it's so wonderful because you can
6:48
basically alphabetically just turn to
6:50
the emotion that you're trying to
6:52
portray and it gives you all these
6:54
examples and even if you don't pull
6:55
examples directly from what they say it
6:58
gives you so much great like inspiration
7:01
of how I can explain that like this
7:04
clenched or you know whose jaw was tight
7:07
or a certain way someone looks or the
7:09
way it feels inside like just the
7:12
different sensations that you would feel
7:13
when you're having that emotion and this
7:16
is one of those that you know you don't
7:18
want to go overboard in your writing
7:19
where it's like every time a character
7:21
has an emotion you have this like very
7:24
like hype we talked about hyperbole in
7:26
the self editing video you don't want it
7:28
to be melodramatic that every single
7:30
time they have a emotion it's this crazy
7:33
thing but you do want to show emotion on
7:36
the page instead of just telling us that
7:38
he was angry we want to see him being
7:40
angry we want to hear it in his voice we
7:43
want to see it in the dialogue tags and
7:44
in the description of how he's doing and
7:46
what he's how is acting and this book is
7:49
a really great resource for that and
7:51
that was their first one I believe that
7:53
came out and now they've got tons of
7:55
these sort of thesauruses they have ones
7:58
that are setting based so you know like
8:01
if you're just describing certain types
8:03
of settings you've got some that are
8:04
like negative trait thesaurus so just go
8:08
check out their entire line of thesaurus
8:12
ortho sorry I don't know which one it is
8:15
but they have tons of them now and I
8:18
actually would love to pick up all of
8:19
them but the only one I think I own is
8:21
the emotion thesaurus it's great for
8:23
editing when you're going through and
8:24
like you've just told a lot of emotions
8:26
like he did this and he was angry now
8:29
you get to and you're editing really
8:30
ramped it up and add that emotion in by
8:33
showing it even better so this is just a
8:35
great resource that I highly recommend
8:37
and I again love to have it on paper
8:39
instead of having it on my phone because
8:42
you can actually like physically turn to
8:44
the page and see it but it also works
8:46
you know they have these in eBook
8:49
Kendyl I know for sure another book that
The Artful Edit
8:52
is really good is by Susan Bell and this
8:54
is called the artful edit so this book
8:56
is a little bit different from just the
8:58
like self editing for fiction writers
9:00
because she goes into a lot of examples
9:02
from other writers who are professional
9:04
and classic authors so she goes into
9:07
like interviews and you know more
9:10
examples and samples of stuff and she
9:13
talks about how you know it is more than
9:15
just the mechanics when you edit your
9:17
book it's more than just the mechanics
9:18
of getting the typos and you know the
9:21
proofreading kind of things of it like
9:23
there is an art to editing your book and
9:25
to crafting it into a better story and I
9:27
just like the approach that she has in
9:29
this book so I highly recommend at least
9:31
picking this one up to read just to get
9:34
the examples and get her point of view
9:36
on the art of editing is called the
9:38
artful edit another book that I
9:40
personally love that was recommended to
9:42
me early on when I first started writing
9:43
young adult is this book called Second
9:46
Sight and it says an editor's talks on
9:47
writing revising and publishing books
9:49
for children and young adult and this is
9:51
by Cheryl B Klein and I know that it is
9:56
specifically says it's writing books for
9:58
children and young adults but I think
10:00
that it's a valuable read for people who
10:02
are writing any kind of book because
10:04
it's it really gives you like a
10:06
professional editors insight and take on
10:09
how to edit a novel and she also talks
10:12
about like she talks about things like
10:14
really bad first lines how to polish up
10:17
that first chapter how to hook your
10:19
reader all of those kinds of things that
10:21
sort of take your writing to the next
10:23
level and give it a second fresh set of
10:25
eyes so I just really really highly
10:27
recommend this as at least a
10:29
read-through if you're not going to pick
10:32
up the actual copy of it like this then
10:34
at least get it in digital format and
10:36
read through it once or get it from your
10:38
library some of these like I said I
10:40
would recommend that you absolutely buy
10:41
I like the emotion thesaurus The
10:44
Elements of Style those are books you
10:46
should buy and have in your library
10:47
second site is something you just at
10:49
least need to read through even if you
10:50
don't purchase the book so see if you
10:52
can grab it from your library I just
10:54
highly recommend it even if you're not
10:55
writing young adult books another book
10:57
that I have to shout out to this other
Creating Character Arcs
11:00
author
11:01
Kraft writing which is km Weiland she
11:03
has changed my writing and taken it to
11:05
the next level her books are brilliant I
11:08
highly recommend that you follow her
11:09
over on Facebook she's constantly
11:11
sharing stuff on her blog and through
11:12
her newsletter I just cannot tell you
11:15
enough like how wonderful she is in
11:17
terms of teaching craft and things like
11:19
that so she has several books she has a
11:21
book on outlining your novel a book on
11:23
structuring your novel and then she has
11:25
also a book that I'm recommending to you
11:27
here called creating character arcs and
11:29
when I first read this book even though
11:32
it's just a few years ago it was a
11:33
little bit over my head because she goes
11:36
so deep into really marrying character
11:39
arc with edits and with the plot of your
11:43
novel and so often books on character
11:45
arc are just like here's your character
11:47
arc here's your plot and they don't have
11:49
anything to do with each other even
11:50
though we as writers know that they're
11:52
interwoven you know you can't have
11:54
character arc what's up without some
11:56
kind of plot doesn't matter if your book
11:57
is plot driven or character driven you
12:00
need both to have a really great novel
12:02
you need that character arc to really
12:05
work well within your plot what she does
12:08
in this book creating character arcs is
12:10
she really goes into how to marry your
12:14
plot points like that first act where
12:16
should your character be in their mental
12:19
state by the time you hit that first act
12:22
and first doorway of no return and this
12:24
for me was mind-blowing she goes a lot
12:27
into the wound your character has and
12:29
what she calls the lie the lie your
12:32
character tells themselves and then she
12:34
basically tells you how a character
12:36
works through that lie throughout the
12:38
novel and I would love kam wildin if you
12:41
ever watch any of my videos which I'm
12:43
sure you're not but if you do I would
12:45
love to see a book on even more how to
12:48
carry those character arcs into a
12:50
long-running series like mine cuz I'm on
12:52
book 11 currently of my long-running
12:54
series so I've been working with the
12:55
same character for a million words and
12:58
so I would love to see like how
13:00
character art continues to grow
13:02
throughout that but that's for another
13:03
video I just highly recommend that when
13:07
you start your edits
13:08
you understand this part because this is
13:10
part of what can take your novel to the
13:11
next level all right so those are my top
13:14
books on editing I promised you this one
13:16
be a little bit shorter go grab I will
13:18
put all the links for you down below I'm
13:21
just giving you the Amazon links because
13:22

to your local Barnes & Noble and grab
13:33
these books in person also if you have
13:37
any recommendations for books that
13:39
specifically deal with editing that you
13:41
love that you use and you find great
13:44
references and resources please go ahead
13:45
and link those down below so that we can
13:47
help each other in the community in
13:49
finding really great books on editing I
13:51
hope this has helped and I will see you
13:53
guys again on Thursday for part 5 of
13:56
this how to edit your novel series where
13:58
we are going to talk about how to know
14:01
when your edits are done because this is
14:03
another thing that I feel like a lot of
14:06
us struggle with that we think okay I'm
14:08
working on it and you could just work on
14:09
it forever and you could fiddle with
14:11
this and you could change this and you
14:12
could go here it's like how do you know
14:14
when it's good enough to send out when
14:16
it's good enough to start querying or
14:18
when it's good enough to actually
14:19
publish it how do you know when to stop
14:21
fiddling with it so we're gonna address
14:23
all your questions about that on
14:24
Thursday and then the final video will
14:27
come on Sunday where we will discuss and
14:30
I will show you my organization of how I
14:32
organize my edits how I do my edits so
14:35
that's going to be another kind of
14:36
longer but more hands-on sort of behind
14:39
the scenes view of edits be sure to head
14:41
over to my website at heart breathing's
14:43
calm slash how to edit your novel and
14:45
pick up your free 12 page editing guide
14:48
download over there and I will see you
14:51
guys in the next video talk soon bye
14:54
[Music]
hey guys welcome back to heart breathing's this is the final video in my how to edit your novel series and
0:06
this one is the most personalized in terms of actually going to show you behind the scenes of how I organize and
0:13
plan my own edits so there's gonna be a little bit of a mix of like planner stuff and you know the actual like
0:20
process of how I edit in this video and I'm going to take you through basically all those stuffs that I talked about in
0:26
my first video on how to self edit your novel or how to edit your own novel and I'm going to show you how I go through
0:32
that process and the tools and things that I use so hopefully you're excited about this one it's gonna be a little bit of a long one so sit back and enjoy
0:43
first of all I will go ahead and pologize for the giant mess that is behind me
0:48
I had partially recorded this video previously but then needed to re-record
0:54
some of the intro and everything and we are moving on Saturday so this is just the state that my office is in it's a
1:01
little bit of a mess because things have to get Messier before they can get organized so just bear with me on that
1:07
one but let's get into how I actually organize my edits so what I'm talking
1:13
about by edits is basically when my rough draft is completed these are the steps that I follow and it really is a
1:18
step by step process for me and how long it takes depends on what kind of shape
1:24
but the book was in in the first place one of the novels that I'm gonna be kind of walking you through right now it was
1:30
book 9 if my shadow demon saga which was beyond the darkness this book was in terrible terrible shape so it needed
1:37
many many editing passes and I'm going to kind of show you the process for what those passes looked like today sometimes
1:43
when I finish a novel though it doesn't need quite as much editing but I still follow the same basic steps so I'm gonna
1:49
walk you through that and all the tools that I use but editing is really such a personalized experience it's really just
1:57
you working through your process when I finished beautiful demons which was my first novel that was actually going to
2:04
be published I was nowhere near in this you know organized state but I'm hoping
2:10
that with the knowledge that I've gained over right more than 25 books over the last nine years I can kind of show you a little
2:18
bit of like tips and tricks things that might help you go a little bit faster or organize that when you feel like you
2:23
just aren't sure how to organize your own edits or where to even start and that sort of thing hopefully this will
2:29
give you some ideas but just know that I'm not saying this is the way everybody should do it because I don't think there
2:34
are any rules like that in writing or in editing there is no should or shouldn't there is no right or wrong it's just what's your
2:41
process and what works for you but I'm hoping that giving you an inside look at my process will kind of give you some
2:48
ideas and spark some ideas so let's get started yeah so let's start off by looking at some materials that I love to
2:54
use obviously you're going to need printer paper if you do want to print out your novel you're gonna need
3:00
something to print I also use color coding in my novels so I've got color coded stickers color coded index cards
3:08
markers and pens and which pens I use kind of varies on the project but right
3:14
now I'm using some Erin Condren markers and pens so this is really the beginning
3:19
of my editing process is getting all those materials together once I have all the materials together where I start is
3:27
always creating an outline of my scenes and I talked about this briefly in my how to self edit your novel video which
3:34
I'll have linked Tauri down below which is the first part of this editing series but I pull up my main document which is
3:41
always in Google Docs so it doesn't matter which computer I'm working on at the time but I pull up that doc and I
3:48
will begin with just a blank sheet of paper I usually do dot grid paper which you can't really tell from this angle
3:54
and I will pull out some sort of color coding method so I have four points of
4:00
view in this novel that I'm talking about today which is beyond the darkness and I often do write multiple POV
4:06
stories so I like to color code my edits and in my plotting so that I keep a good
4:11
eye on just at a glance can tell whose chapter I'm dealing with what character
4:17
I'm dealing with so I have my four different colors for the four POVs and I'm just using a set of circle stickers
4:24
that I like to use then I will make sure that I pull up my document
4:29
which is my rough draft in Google Docs and I will begin creating an outline of
4:34
my scenes now this is different from what I did in the plotting process and I'll kind of show you a closer look at
4:40
this in just a minute but basically what I do is I just go chapter by chapter and write out what each chapter is about
4:48
what's happening in the chapter you know if there's any sort of special plot
4:53
point that happens in this chapter whose POV it's in according to the color code so chapter one in this particular novel
5:01
is Harper and her color is always purple for me so I will take out you know a
5:06
purple sticker and purple pin and I will write out just a brief description of
5:11
what's happening in this chapter and you know that this is the opening chapter so this is often what I call the
5:17
disturbance or the hook and I will mark kind of how that plays out in the rough
5:22
draft not what I want to happen or anything like that but what happens in the rough draft and so then I will just
5:28
go through scene by scene and I'm not necessarily at this point reading through the entire novel but I'm just
5:34
creating a list of scenes because when I was plotting I likely created a list of scenes I intended to write but I don't
5:41
have at this point a complete list of the scenes that I actually wrote that exists there then I'm also marking down
5:49
things like what didn't feel right what chapter I know isn't quite good enough
5:54
or isn't exactly how I want it to be and then I will also mark in there like if I
6:02
know that a scene is missing pieces or it was just more of a brainstorm scene or a placeholder scene and I know that
6:08
that scene needs to be filled in and I'll show you in just a second how I mark those different things on the sheet but this is the first step of the
6:14
process for me is to create an outline of the scene sometimes if I have color coded note cards I will also create note
6:21
cards of these scenes that I can flip back and forth through them but I don't always do that it kind of just depends
6:27
on if I feel like it but I always create this sort of outline because it gets me reefa Miller you know at this point it's
6:33
probably been weeks or months since I've worked on these first few chapters so it gets me reefa Miller with how the story
6:40
was in the big what still needs to be changed and as I'm making this list of scenes I'm already thinking about the big picture
6:46
of what needs to change in the novel what is in place and what still needs to
6:52
be put in place what needs to change and all of that sort of thing on a big picture so at this point I don't just
6:57
jump into making changes in my novel I just go ahead and make this outline first so I'm going to show you what that
7:04
looks like on the actual paper okay so that was the beginning of my process I
7:09
also use this plotting notebook which is a big happy planner in a deluxe planner
7:14
I covered up the word hustle because it's not my favorite word with this little decal here that is coming off so
7:21
I need to remake that so pay no attention to how terrible that looks but inside here is where I keep all my
7:28
plotting notes and I have another video on how I organized for this and how I've
7:34
been using it so I will link that down below I've got some other things in there that I'm playing around with right now but basically I realized as I was
7:44
getting ready to record this which was the last video in my editing series of
7:49
course that I actually since I'm packing to move I actually packed up some of my
7:55
like old plotting stuff and I don't want to use my current novel because it's gonna have spoilers and things like that
8:01
so we're just kind of improvising and just giving you guys a basic example of how I organize my edits but when I'm
8:09
ready to plot a novel I will put a new tab in my notebook and I usually only
8:15
keep the novels that I'm like working on now or about to work on so I can keep notes in here and I will just write any
8:21
kind of notes on paper in here I also will have these are actually happy
8:27
planner calendar pages that I have covered with whiteout and washi tape and
8:33
everything else just to be able to use old happy planner pages where the dates have already passed by so I didn't have
8:40
to throw them out and waste them because I had a planner that was basically from a previous year that I wanted to reuse
8:46
so I've been using this kind of system for my plotting for a long time but this is not the book that I've been kind of
8:51
showing you guys which is book 9 of my series that was booked three of my eternal sorrow
8:58
the series which I was working on for a long time this year and it just wasn't coming together but this will kind of
9:03
give you an idea I don't have much of the actual plot grid filled out but it's all in other notes so at least I can
9:10
give you an idea of what the plotting grid looks like now normally when the book is finished and I'm starting my
9:16
edits this entire plotting grid is already filled out and as you can see I like to use these stickers these are
9:24
teacher creative resources and they have eight different colors and of course you've got two greens here I wish they
9:30
had a different color than two greens but at least you have eight different colors to use with your color coding and
9:38
there are nice round stickers I have been kind of looking maybe for some smaller stickers to use but for now
9:44
these are good you can also if you don't want to buy stickers just use the fat tip of a marker like these are the Erin
9:51
Condren dual tip markers and they have these bigger kind of fatter ends or you
9:57
could use Crayola super tips which are really inexpensive and you can just use these to create a little dot that looks
10:05
kind of like a sticker I mean you don't need a sticker so you can color code in that way with little dots with your
10:10
markers so I color code and give a different color to each one of my POV
10:16
characters so you can see in this book there are eight POV characters and so a lot of different POVs going on in this
10:23
one but when the story is done and I'm moving on to the editing process this will already be filled out with the
10:29
things that I have currently written now this plot will usually change quite a bit in the editing process but I'll at
10:35
least have the scenes that I wrote written out here to some degree and usually this is something that I would
10:41
fill out either along the way as I'm plotting or before I begin writing so a
10:46
lot of what ends up on these two sheets and my happy planner notes changes quite a bit so the way I have this marked off
10:54
is I keep Act one in this column the first part of Act one and then the second part of Act one so the climax of
11:01
Act one would be down here in the second column then I have the first part of Act two and then the second part of
11:08
- which is kind of like leading up to the midpoint which would be here and then ACTA - continues with what I call
11:14
part three of Acts - and part 4 where the black moment or all is lost like dark night of the soul would be down
11:19
here and then all the Act three usually fits on this last a little bit so this
11:25
would all be filled out so imagine if I was working on edits for beyond the darkness that this is all already filled
11:30
out but my next step in the process is what you just saw me working on which is
11:35
going through I usually will have my current rough draft pulled up on my
11:41
desktop I just go down my index and I will write out the scenes as they stand
11:47
right now and any notes that I seem to have on them so I will mark if it's like
11:54
the disturbance or it's something like the point of no return the Act one doorway the argument against
12:00
transformation the inciting incident stuff like that I will mark that in black but everything else goes in the
12:06
color code of the actual character so like I said in my demon series I have
12:12
four main characters forming POVs and they have their own color so Harper is
12:19
always purple for me Jackson is blue leah is green and Ayrton
12:24
is red and so I just keep that as my color code usually I will also have note
12:30
cards that have their scenes on them and there will be these four colors as well but I already packed those note cards
12:35
another solution if you don't want to buy colored note cards is you can either cut up paper if you don't want to buy
12:40
note cards at all or you can get like regular white ones or whatever you have access to and use your stickers or your
12:46
markers to color code them so if this was an aired in chapter and I wanted to color code it that way I could just do a
12:53
red circle here or I could write his name here at the top and know that it's color coded to him another way that you
13:00
could color code your index cards if you didn't want to buy them or you didn't have like the right colors you wanted to
13:06
use is to have washi tape available in each of the colors and you could put a
13:12
little washi strip on top of the index card or on the side just kind of
13:19
depending on how you tend to go through them so let's say we're going to put it on the side and what I could do is like all of
13:25
our dens that are red could go here in the middle but all of harpers that are purple
13:34
could go here kind of on the edge so that when I'm looking at my stack of
13:40
note cards I could see whose was whose based on the washi tape so that's just one little
13:46
trick that you could use I pretty much tend to always have markers pins index
13:54
cards stickers and washi tape in my coordinating colors sometimes they have
13:59
patterns sometimes they're plain but this just helps me visually and it makes it more fun for me which makes me more
14:05
motivated to actually get my head it's done which I know can sound silly but some of my planner babes out there you guys understand what I'm talking about
14:12
so usually like I said I will have at the end of a rough draft I will have
14:18
this chart all filled out and I will also have a stack of note cards that already have like basic ideas of the
14:24
scenes written on them but my first step in my editing process is to go through
14:30
the rough draft as it is currently mark out what characters have which chapters
14:36
so this is chapter one two three and four and I will mark anything like in
14:41
bold with a bigger marker if it's like a missing scene or something I still need
14:46
to work on so for example in the rough draft of beyond the darkness the second
14:52
chapter is Jackson at the Cypress gate which is a demon gate in my town and
14:57
he's casting a ritual to close it and free Eloise's demon and it works and she meets her demon so if you're a fan of my
15:05
books you know that that is not at all what happens in the final book this is just the way it was in the rough draft but I would have noted here as I was
15:12
going through it in the rough draft and say this still doesn't feel quite right to me and I don't know if you can tell
15:18
but that's in a little bit of a thicker marker so that that note stands out and that's just the way I like to do it you
15:25
can kind of come up with your own system but that way when I'm writing out the entire rough draft and everything that's
15:31
there I can mark in bold anything that didn't quite seem right anything that was part of one of the major plot points
15:37
that I talked about in my how to plot your novel series and then anything that's missing so I had some little
15:43
notes here for what I wanted to write about Leah but she didn't actually have a seen here so I knew that I had skipped
15:50
that scene because in my rough draft I actually say I'm just going to brainstorm here because I'm not exactly
15:55
sure how I want to start her POV so I marked that here now once this first
16:00
stage of the process is over I would have several sheets here with my color coded chapters and usually these books
16:07
are about a hundred thousand words and they end up being somewhere around forty to fifty chapters because I write short
16:14
our chapters and they would so it would be like maybe ten to a page so I'd have
16:20
four pages full of this but just the process of going back through and seeing
16:25
all the different scenes laid out and seeing what's missing and all that already gets me started and prepped up
16:31
for part two of my editing process which is to look at the big picture so let's move on to that so when I move on to
16:39
looking at the big picture the types of things that I'm looking at are the big
16:44
overall story structure did I meet all the plot points did I get to where I wanted to go with each of the chapters
16:49
what scenes are missing how should I fill those in just all these big questions and like I said in but you
16:56
know in the first part of this editing series which I'll link for you down below which is how to self edit your
17:01
novel I don't at this stage go through and correct grammar rewrite dialogue
17:06
look at line by line picky little edits I'm not doing word choice and simple
17:12
little things right now like picky little things what I'm doing is looking at big picture stuff so is the character
17:18
arc in place what still needs to happen in the plot is the plot wonky in some
17:24
areas does it surprise you there's a whole list of questions in my editing guide if you haven't downloaded that you
17:29
can find the link for it down below it's just a free editing guide that has a bunch of questions and help in your editing process but if you've watched my
17:38
guide series on how to plot your novel these pages might look familiar to you
17:43
so I created this sort of plotting guide based on some of my favorite books on writing and plotting and craft and this
17:50
just kind of brings it all together so this is the characters inner journey again color-coded with some washi said
17:57
this would be Jackson's point of view if it was blue I have from Debra Dixon's goal motivation conflict her little box
18:04
here for outer and inner conflict I have character arc this basically comes from one of James Scott Bell's
18:10
book about write your story from the middle where's my character at the beginning where are they at the mirror moment and at the end and then I have
18:16
all of my major plot points which comes from several books so if you'd like to see what books those are definitely go
18:22
and download my how to plot your novel guide as well so hopefully that will be helpful to you basically before I start
18:28
my rough draft I always filled this out to the best of my ability some of these little pieces might not come together
18:34
until I'm actually writing but I will get this done as as best I can then I actually reprint this entire
18:41
guide and I will fill it out again a lot of these things like name age I color
18:46
that stuff does I don't even sometimes usually mess with that I just go through the things that really changed and
18:52
especially the plotting parts for each character so I don't do characters that
18:58
don't have a voice or a point of view if the whole story is from one character's point of view then she's the only one
19:04
that I will print out but like I said in this story there are four major points of view so they each get this entire
19:10
guide printed out for themselves and I begin looking at the list of scenes that
19:17
I just made for each character and so I'll just if I'm looking at Jackson only I'll just look for these blue dots and
19:24
I'll start filling out what actually happens in the rough draft and that way I can really begin to think through his
19:31
character arc his plot arc his story and say what's missing where am I going
19:37
wrong in this plot like do I have a really good like tests and challenges for him it does he see a pinch point now
19:45
I talked about this a little bit before but every single character like all four
19:50
of my characters will not hit every single one of these beats if they did this would probably be every book would
19:55
be 300 thousand words you don't see them go through this and sometimes like for example aired in his storyline and his
20:02
character goes through this whole process over the course of two books not one Harper is generally my main
20:09
character so she will have a complete story arc and character arc in every book but some of other characters it their story arc will
20:16
go over the course of several books and that is a whole nother video and can of
20:22
worms to open up talking about plotting multiple POV between books so I'm not
20:27
even going to really go there but I will just say I will fill this out to the best of my ability to what I know needs to happen for Jackson's character in
20:34
this book so once I'm done filling out as much as I can here I likely have a lot of questions so I am not the kind of
20:41
person who can just typically sit down and just think and be pensive about stuff I have to go on walks I have to
20:48
talk it through with my friends or my husband or I have to actually write down my thoughts because if I just sit there
20:54
thinking I feel like I'm just going in circles so a lot of times what I would do let's say I was working on Jackson's
21:00
point of view because I really wasn't sure where I was going to change what he was doing next
21:05
I will typically put his color washing tape and I will create a little page for
21:11
Jackson and I usually try to make this really nice and pretty and something
21:16
that I want to work on and I will put his name here at the top sometimes I use
21:24
my tombow dual brush pens to to mark headers and stuff but I can't show you guys that because I already packed those
21:30
but let's say this is Jackson's page and I will often keep a lot of little
21:36
stickers and different things here in the front of my plotting notebook
21:42
because I like to use these to make my pages look nicer and of course you don't
21:48
have to use this step if you're not a planner person you probably won't use this stuff but since I said I was going
21:54
to show you what I do I will show you what I would do so I might be out getting coffee and I'll put a little
22:00
sticker there and then I will take my pins and I will begin to mark down the questions that I have so right now I
22:07
might just start journaling about like I don't like where his story started where
22:16
can I go next so I'll start with the questions that I
22:22
have like I don't like where this story started it didn't feel right where can I go with him and then what I might do is
22:27
just start a long stream here of possibilities of where I might go so I
22:34
might say you know what if he does this or what if he does this or what if he
22:39
does this so I might come up with like five different four or five different choices of what he might do and that
22:45
will spark a new idea and then I'll put up a new little flag here and I will
22:51
continue on with you know like let's say I decide this is the one like what if he
22:57
goes and like goes insane and starts questioning a hunter so I will put a little note there because that's the one
23:03
I like and then I might make a little note that okay I like this and so on and
23:12
so I will actually just journal my way through thoughts about Jackson so I
23:17
wanted to show you that even though it's not exactly a perfect example of what it would look like but when I'm done with
23:24
this stage of the process of like getting through all of the character arc and the big story parts of the edits I
23:30
will usually have multiple multiple pages if you're curious about this all I
23:35
do to create these pages is I bought on Etsy just dot grid printable letter
23:43
pages and I have it in black pink green all kinds of stuff and I used to print
23:48
them out in color-coded but now I just print them out in grayscale and it works out fine but I print out these pages
23:55
just on regular letter sized white paper and then I use my big happy planner
24:00
punch to put them in here so that's kind of a nice way to get sort of a bullet journal feel because I like using dot
24:06
grid so I can draw headers and different things like that so I can give you guys kind of an example of how this might go
24:12
so I'm working up currently on a book called the disappearance of Vanessa sha so this would be kind of how these pages
24:19
start to look is like very much journal type pages that I put stickers on and
24:26
all this kind of stuff so this is kind of how my edits end up looking and by plotting so I'll have a series of
24:32
plotting sheets and a series of editing it's where I have just really thought through the process and kind of using
24:38
stickers and color codes and different things like that just keeps me motivated to keep working on the story and then
24:45
what I will do because I will usually print out a sheet like this which is also part of my plotting guide sorry I
24:51
messed up some of the punching there but this again just has those four columns
24:57
so you've got act 1 act 2 part 1 part 2 and then act 3 and this is kind of just
25:03
a very simple story grid and I don't usually make this look pretty I don't even usually use my stickers but what I
25:10
will do is I will usually go through again this entire process of going
25:17
through all the different scenes and instead of just regurgitating what I have written down about what exists in
25:23
the current draft I will go in now and I will begin to sketch out what needs to
25:29
be done to fix this plot so I wish that I had a better example for this where I
25:35
could actually show you and walk you through this but that would just take me hours and hours to go through but
25:40
basically what I would do is I would say okay let's say we're starting back with Harper and I would have at this point
25:49
decided if this opening scene is really where I want her to start and if it is then I will go back and I will add a
25:55
little dot here and I will say like Harper's Harper Harper out the asylum
26:03
and then sometimes I will leave myself a little note that says you know scene
26:10
stays because that scene is going to stay exactly as it is but obviously
26:16
Jackson's scene that didn't feel quite right to me is going to change so at this point in the process after going
26:22
through his point of view and all of those sort of big picture things I should have a much better idea of what's
26:29
going to happen with his point of view so now what I would do is I would take my blue marker and I would mark what is
26:35
going to be different about his scene so if instead now I'm going to have him
26:41
questioning a hunter because I don't want to have
26:50
him do this with the Cypress gay and free her demon here that just didn't feel right so now I've taken him on a
26:57
different journey and he's gonna be questioning a hunter and so now I've got that scene in place and I would just go
27:03
through the same process and take the scenes that I know are there and now put them into a story grid and like I said I
27:08
don't worry about if this is really beautiful or not I just get the story back in place the way I want it to be
27:14
and this is a difficult process this takes me weeks to complete especially with a multi POV novel but this part of
27:22
the process is so important because if your plot isn't there and your character arcs aren't there you don't really have
27:28
a great story so it's all fine and good to consider that your editing is going to be like oh let me fix this word or
27:34
fix this typo but you really need to have the best story you can be so don't
27:40
skip this part make sure that your story is in place the way you want it to be by
27:45
the time I finish two edits on beyond at the darkness this was almost a completely different story so just a lot
27:51
of changes can happen so this is kind of the second part is I go through every character I look at what scenes didn't
27:58
feel right I look at the plot and where I want it to be and then I make a new story grid so then I will go back to my
28:06
computer and I will start to fix my story so let me take you over there okay so I'm going to show you guys kind of
28:13
what my rough drafts tend to look like so first I write in Google Docs I've
28:20
talked about this before if you're interested in hearing more about that I also have a video I'll link down below for you but basically I don't name my
28:26
chapters in the beginning they're just 1 2 3 and I have this nice little index down here at the at the end but I
28:33
basically have my entire rough draft sometimes it will not be in order you can see I've got all of harpers chapters
28:38
here all of Leah's chapters here and I haven't even put them in the appropriate order that they will be in the final
28:45
draft but at this point what I've done in the editing process is I've gone through each chapter written out what
28:53
happens and how it fits in so for example here's just brainstorming stuff about what might happen with Lia which I told
28:59
you was a missing scene and so on what I do next is sometimes I will have so I
29:06
have some multiple things up here which I create a new draft or a new doc every
29:11
time I start a new draft so my second draft of beyond the darkness I just called beyond the
29:16
darkness second draft and it also has a similar outline but now you can see I have actual chapters here and this is a
29:24
you know good start this is not the full novel but this is where I started and
29:30
when I did the second draft to just get this first act down path so basically
29:37
what I will tend to do depending on how the story goes and if it needs a tons of ton of rewrites this book from the super
29:44
rough draft ended up being such a rough draft that it needed a lot of rewrites and had a lot of missing scenes so what
29:51
I would do is I would I'm actually going to go ahead and do this now I would
29:57
create a new document and I would call it beyond the darkness second draft or
30:06
whatever but I'm just gonna write tests because it's not gonna be something I'm going to use now every time I probably
30:12
could set up some kind of template but every time I start a new document I move this over to the point 1 9 so that I've
30:18
got my little indent there automatic indent and what I would do is I would go
30:23
through and I would copy the first chapter and let's see so I would take it
30:33
all the way through I would ctrl C to copy it and then I would paste it in over here and what
30:39
this does for me is it just gives me that one chapter and one chapter only to
30:44
be dealing with at a time and you can just click this to get your outline or to make it go away so I just have copied over only the
30:52
first chapter because as I'm working through these edits that I was talking about I am working on character arc I'm
31:00
working on the overall plot and that sort of thing so I'm just gonna bring one chapter over at a time but at this
31:06
point again I'm not reading through it for typos things like that what I will do however
31:12
is I will do a search I just usually will do ctrl F which will bring up this
31:18
find and document and I look for the xx's and I've mentioned this before but basically whenever I have a question
31:25
while I'm writing and I don't want to stop the flow of my writing I will put in an X X so here's the first one right
31:32
on the first page what would happen when the authorities arrived and found out that the owner and top psychiatrists of this private institution have been
31:38
killed where would they take us and I was like do I want to you know I know this xx question mark is is she called
31:45
us top psychiatrist is that what I want to call her you know that sort of thing so at this point in time I would deal
31:51
with those kinds of questions I would go ahead and fix that even though I'm not looking line by line reading through the
31:57
book I would check for those things so then I go to the next one and I would
32:02
say oh she you know Harper says and I needed to find Brooke xx who were her other allies outside the asylum Nora who
32:08
else helped her and so I would start to think about that look back in the previous book figure out how I'm gonna
32:14
fix that and I would go ahead and start to fill in all of these xx holes and what I like about that is I would fix
32:23
those kinds of holes but I only have the first chapter here to deal with which makes it a little bit easier and a
32:29
little bit less overwhelming plus it gives me something that I can do in a small chunk of time so I could maybe just say I'm just gonna work on chapter
32:35
ones X X's or questions and this one is like I said this was an extremely rough
32:41
draft for me so this one needed a lot of changes and a lot of stuff so there were a lot of like XX type things as soon as
32:48
I felt like this chapter was at least good enough like I said not line editing
32:53
but just seemed like it was good enough this chapter is the way it was gonna stay just fix those little holes I would
33:00
go in and I would think about this chapter now because like I said I knew
33:06
that this chapter didn't feel right to me instead of pulling this chapter over and copy and pasting it I would actually
33:13
start a brand new chapter so what I would do here is I would go down to the
33:18
last word and I would hit ctrl enter group ctrl enter and
33:24
I would start a brand new chapter so this would be Chapter two and this is Jackson's point of view so I
33:31
would start that I would label the to go up to normal text and give that heading one so it becomes heading one over here
33:38
in my edits and then I would highlight the word Jackson and give that heading two so that now he becomes a point of
33:44
view so this get just creates my outline it makes it easy for me to switch between chapters or points of view or to
33:51
see whose point of view it is so then at this point what I would do is I would rewrite you know whatever is going to
33:58
happen here so after I've been through the stuff I just showed you where I've
34:04
been through all my notes and all my things this is basically like a second rough draft I'm rewriting this is big
34:10
parts of the edits big swaths of edits when that chapter was done I would go down and look at chapter three and if I
34:16
decided this is where Harper was still going to be that this is still what's going to stay in the story again I would
34:22
just copy it I would make sure to control enter so that I get a new page
34:29
break and then I would control V which copies and which pastes the old chapter
34:35
on so then I would go through Harper's chapter here and I would fix again these
34:40
X X's that I had in the story and just fix the bigger sort of character arc
34:45
things and this at this point I'm actually reading through the actual
34:51
story and trying to fix what I can and replace what I can so hopefully that
34:56
gives you an idea of how the edits would go once I feel like they are pretty good
35:01
and I've got you know good start on where I'm going then I will move on to the next part so part three of my edits
35:09
are usually to do actual line by line edits and at this point I create a
35:15
another document so would go in I would create file new document and this time I
35:22
usually call this one if I feel like it's going to be ready when I'm starting my line at it I will call this one the
35:28
title of the book and then edits or betas because I know that this is the version that's going to my beta readers
35:36
you can see I often will at first call these chapter one still or I will
35:43
actually put in the title which you can see later on in my final draft I tend to
35:49
in my demon series my process is to title the chapters based on something
35:55
that comes from the book or from the chapter itself so I actually in my betas
36:01
document before they got to it this would have had the title so when I'm going through before I give that to them
36:07
I would have titled this into the past and it would be here now I'll explain why it says done here in a minute but so
36:14
basically I go through that same process that I did with the second draft I will go through and I will copy chapter one
36:21
only and paste it in over here and so now I have that same first chapter and
36:26
I'm only dealing with this chapter now like I said one of the reasons that I love doing this is because it allows me
36:34
to look at one chapter at a time without feeling so overwhelmed that I'm like changing the whole novel plus it allows
36:41
me to just sort of build the novel back up again without having to like move characters around move scenes around
36:47
what I can do is you know copy and paste them in the order that they wanted to be
36:52
you know that they're going to end up in the story so let's say for example in my second draft I had Harper Jackson Harper and I
36:59
decided that I was going to actually put Harper as chapters one and two and move Jackson to chapter three if I had copied
37:05
and pasted or I was working inside this document I would have to actually like start moving things around now this is
37:12
one place where Scrivener is really something that shines because you can actually just like drag and drop
37:17
chapters to change them but you can't do that in Google Docs at least not that I'm aware of so what I like to do is I
37:23
will change you know I will start a new document and then what I would have done is if I wanted Harper to be chapter 1 &
37:29
2 I would have copied chapter 1 done my edits all over here on that chapter and then I would have taken chapter 3 and
37:35
copied it and renamed s chapter 2 and then I would continue to build the document or the novel in the way that I
37:42
wanted it to be in the long run so hopefully that makes sense everybody kind of has their own
37:48
sequence of doing things so hopefully this kind of follows for you but I basically will rewrite redo and at this
37:56
point once the book is pretty much done in terms of the plotting and the characterization and that sort of thing
38:02
now I'm kind of fixing the scene water and I'm actually lined by line editing so would copy chapter 1 and this time
38:10
I'm going to read through it with a fine-tooth comb and I would actually be making word
38:15
changes at this point if you aren't sure what I mean by line edits or line by line go back and watch that first video
38:23
in this series of how to self out at your novel and you'll see those kind of questions and those sort of things that I'm fixing but here I'm actually finally
38:30
fixing grammar dialogue typos all that kind of thing this is where I'm really
38:35
looking at it line by line making sure the emotion is there making sure that the words are the correct word choice
38:41
and they're as strong as they can be and I'm going every single line at a time and being very picky and making those
38:47
kinds of changes so I finish this sometimes I will wait until I finished
38:54
like you can see this one has 53 chapters but sometimes I will wait until
39:00
it's all finished and do one more read-through and then I will send it to my betas at which point I will just
39:06
click the share button and email it to them but sometimes if I'm running closer
39:12
to a deadline or I'm trying to get the book out more quickly I will wait until I have the first acts chapters in here
39:18
and line edited and then I will email my beta readers and I will let them know that the first like five to ten chapters
39:24
are up so they can start actually reading through this as I am continuing
39:31
to build the document so I've talked about that before on my Google Docs and why I write in Google Docs video if you
39:36
want to see that but sometimes we're collaborating on the same document at the same time then when I have finished
39:42
all the line edits and everything has been copied over rewritten everything's finished on that next step I let the
39:51
betas usually have it at this point and they're going through and they're fixing little things they're checking things
39:57
they're fixing or letting me know if there's any characterization issues or more plot
40:04
things so at which point I will wait and get their feedback from it so that's why
40:10
I have the word done here because I will wait until they say to me they're done
40:15
with a certain chapter or they're done with the entire book and I know at this point instead of just having a blank
40:21
document I will actually have comments here so my beta readers would have gone
40:27
through and they will like highlight this and they'll leave a comment and it'll be something like you know I don't like this you know just give an example
40:35
and they would leave a comment so when I come back after my betas are done there will be all of their comments will be on
40:41
this document and so what I mean by done is I will take it chapter by chapter after my betas are finished
40:48
and I will resolve or fix any issues or decide if I'm going to change them or
40:54
not and once it's done I will click resolve and then that is now finished and I can finish this whole chapter I
41:02
will usually read through it one more time make sure everything looks good so once all their comments have been
41:07
resolved I will create yet another document and this one will usually be
41:12
called the title of the book and final so I know this is my final kind of my
41:17
final version this is the last one I'm going to mess with and when I finish everything and later go back to look I
41:23
know this was the final document so I'll create another final document and as I go through chapter by chapter I will
41:30
again copy and paste the chapter into the new document and I will leave the
41:35
title as it is but over here in my betas one I will mark it as done so I know that this chapter has been gone through
41:42
you know fully it's been through beta readers I've read through it again and now it has been transferred to my final
41:49
document then I'll do the same process with chapter two and I will look at you
41:56
know everything that's happening here is this where we ended up and you can see in this more final version Jackson is
42:03
not at all where we thought he was going to be he is now on the steps of in and Victorian staring at the ruined Hospital
42:09
so he's definitely not where he was in the beginning so you can see there were some major major rewrites that were done
42:15
when this one has been resolved and I feel like everything's done on that side of it I will copy Jackson's chapter over
42:22
to the final one with the correct title hair dark purposes and then I will mark
42:28
it done over here and I will go through every single chapter of the book like that until the entire book has been
42:34
edited and re-edited and this is maybe the fourth or fifth draft by now and the book is finally done so believe it or
42:42
not this is still only about halfway through my editing process so let's move on to the fourth step so the fourth step
42:49
is to actually take that document that you just saw that was marked final and I
42:55
print it out and just for funsies I usually print out a full-color photo as well of the actual book and then I will
43:02
print the entire thing and I will go through it with a read aloud
43:08
so usually I will just sit at my computer and I will have the printed version here with my four colors of pins
43:17
in case I want to mark anything on the side to have it stand out against the black text and I will turn on usually
43:24
naturalreader comm which I will link for you down below and I will input my
43:29
document into naturalreader and it will read it aloud to me so I will listen to it as I'm going through it with my eyes
43:36
as well and I will mark any changes on this document that need to be put into
43:42
the final version okay moving on that of course takes some time but it's so worth
43:49
it reading it aloud listening to your story is so worth it I highly recommend not skipping that step then what I will
43:56
do is I will go through that paper copy that I just showed you and I will input any changes that I noticed needed to be
44:02
changed when I was listening to the story I will go ahead and input those and for me I find it better to be
44:09
listening to it and have a paper copy and read through it just because if I'm
44:15
focusing on listening to it and being on my computer there's a lot more destruction that can happen like a some
44:21
kind of notification can pop up so I like to have that one printed version where I'm seeing it in a different format it's not
44:28
computer I'm seeing it with my eyes like in a printed format and then I will go into this final document and I'll make
44:34
any changes any typos that I noticed any awkward words any repeated words like
44:39
any of those little things I will input those changes then the fifth step is
44:45
since I'm in a Google Doc right now I will go to file and I will download as a
44:51
Microsoft Word docs and my computer is super slow this is an older Mac so it's
44:57
just like that you can see it's naming it final one because I already have a copy of this but we're gonna just call
45:03
it that and we're gonna click Save and then once that is downloaded I'm going
45:09
to click for it to open and that's probably just going to take a second for it to open in Word and then I'm going to
45:15
run through this entire novel in Word and I have mentioned this before in my
45:22
Google Docs video and here on my editing videos but I don't feel like Google Docs
45:28
has the best grammar and spell checker in the business but I did notice when I
45:34
opened up Google Docs just today that they had a little notification here that says we're now helping you fix your
45:41
grammar and now you can see that it has these little blue squiggly lines and when I click on that it's giving me a
45:48
suggestion to put a comma in there like over here it's saying and if I'd made
45:55
any mistakes I could put everyone here in danger so it's suggesting that I just say put everyone in danger so these are
46:01
actually pretty good changes so it might be worth it for me to actually take my current novels that are already
46:06
published and run them through this new Google Docs version of a grammar editor
46:11
I know some of you commented on my video and suggested grammarly which is another free I believe it's a free Chrome
46:17
extension ok so as you can see my document has finally come up and so what
46:23
I would typically do at this point is I am going to go to review and there is a
46:32
read aloud feature here which you could use if you wanted to use that instead but I'm gonna go to spelling and grammar
46:38
and it's going to basically suggest every single thing that it would
46:43
suggest so into the past it's telling me to put this down like not capitalized
46:49
but it's part of my chapter heading so I'm gonna ignore that once and so on and at this point I would just go through
46:55
all of their suggestions on commas and that sort of thing but you really need to when you're doing these sort of
47:01
automated grammar checkers you really need to read every single thing don't
47:06
just click you know to change everything because they're going to be times where
47:11
you don't want to make the changes because they're suggesting commas where they don't belong they're trying to change their what your voice and that
47:18
sort of thing and so you just need to make sure that you're making the right changes instead of just blindly changing
47:25
them all but I would go through a process this only takes maybe thirty minutes to an hour to check your grammar
47:30
and your spelling and typos and that sort of thing to see last-minute little
47:36
like typos and things like that once this part of the process is done I will take every little change that I made
47:42
here and I will change it within my document as well so what I like to do
47:48
since I'm working in Google Docs at the same time that I'm working in Word is I
47:54
will have both of them up on my computer at the same time when I'm working on my desktop I have two different monitors so
48:00
I'll have the word on one monitor and my Google Doc on the other monitor and I
48:06
will just if I make a change that they suggest over here in Word then I will just go ahead and input it and make the
48:12
change over in the Google Doc to this part is a little bit more of a pain but
48:18
it's worth it for me to be writing in Google Docs and to just use this as an extra tool and there usually aren't that
48:24
many changes that need to be made but I make sure that I make those changes at the same time because otherwise it would
48:30
be too hard to go back in and see what I had changed so that's just part of my process then what I do next is I move on
48:37
to what is getting very close to the final step in my process which is my final read-through okay so I don't have
48:45
any good video clips of this but I'm just going to tell you briefly what the process is so I will usually do a final
48:51
read-through before I send it to my editor' my professional editor on
48:57
usually on my computer and i will usually pull out my Chromebook and do this because i like to be like sitting
49:02
on the couch and on the bed and being comfortable and i will make changes in the document as i see them but i'm
49:08
trying to at this point put myself in the headspace of the reader are going
49:13
through and reading this and thinking does this surprise me and i try to do this read through all in one sitting as
49:20
much as possible i may move around the house while I'm doing it I may switch to my phone which is one of the reasons I
49:26
love Google Docs is I can switch between computers and things like that but I do try to complete this all in the course
49:32
of you know a few hours so that I get a really good feeling of the cohesiveness of the novel then I will send it out to
49:39
my professional editor at that point I will you know sit on it I will wait for
49:45
the comments to come back from them and then when they do come back I will go through that same process that I did
49:50
with my word document where I will take the document from the editor if sometimes I do have work with an editor
49:56
who will edit in my Google Doc but most of the time they want to use word so I
50:02
will marry the two documents I'll go through her edits in Word and then put them all into my final document and then
50:08
everything at that point is ready for formatting and sometimes you know I do
50:15
send it to a line editor and then it will be back and forth kind of thing where it will be also then going to a
50:20
proofreader I never skip the proofreading process but it just kind of depends on how many edits and how many
50:26
editing rounds but this is the stage at which it goes through the edits and the editors that I'm using and then it goes
50:32
through that final process of marrying all the documents and then it's ready
50:37
for formatting at that point we are getting very close to the end of this process and the end of this very long
50:44
video but once I've inputted all my changes and I feel like everything is done and I am ready to publish this book
50:51
I will format the book so I use this program called vellum and it was one of
50:56
the main reasons well one of two main reasons that I ended up buying a Mac because I'm typically like a PC kind of
51:05
girl I do a lot of gaming and that sort of thing so I love my see but I had to get a Mac not only because I want to publish directly
51:11
through iTunes Connect to the Apple bookstore but also because of this program right here called vellum this is
51:18
life-changing my husband used to format all of my books for me but now I have
51:24
this amazing program that will format paperbacks and ebooks and it's just the
51:29
easiest thing I highly recommend it it's maybe a few hundred dollars for lifetime access to it plus you need a Mac but it
51:36
is so worth it it is amazing if you're planning on publishing a lot of books I highly recommend to this so what I would
51:42
do is I would import my Word file here so I would go back into Google Docs I would download the final file as a docx
51:49
and then I would import the word file to vellum so I'm gonna pull this up because
51:54
this is the book we were talking about is beyond to the darkness so here you can see what it looks like inside vellum
52:01
so once I have imported the book it's going to have all those chapters already
52:08
formatted for me sometimes I do have to kind of play around with getting the
52:14
right titles or you know making sure so the next stage of my editing process is actually to pull up again a copy of my
52:22
final draft and I will compare the
52:27
outline of the final draft to the outline of my formatted draft so I'll
52:34
say into the past into the past her dark purposes her dark purposes will they remember will they remember and I
52:40
double-check that every single chapter is there and is correct because sometimes when you import your Word file
52:46
into vellum it will have two chapters in one and it won't have separated them
52:51
correctly even if you put a page break in there so you can't just set it and forget it you really do need to double
52:58
check that's the next step in the process is formatting which again is super easy but definitely making sure
53:05
that everything that's in the outline in the right order showed up here and then
53:11
I actually will do another step and I will go through and I will count these chapters all over again and make sure
53:16
that if it said 60 chapters here that I actually have 60 chapter's plus an epilogue over here so
53:23
a little bit of just like sort of detailed work but again you don't want
53:29
to skip any of these types of steps when you're formatting and this kind of thing becomes very important but basically
53:35
once this step is over I will go one step further and I will compile this so
53:42
you would say generate and I will generate it so right now it's set for print but you can go in here and you can
53:48
say I want to generate it for Apple Kindle Nook Kobo Google and so on and you can put specific links and for each
53:54
of those vendors so I would go ahead and I would generate and click continue and then once I had let's say I like to read
54:00
through my books like on my phone in Google Play Books app so I would just Google do the Google version of it and I
54:08
would put that on my phone and I would just thumb through it to make sure all the formatting looks good on my phone
54:14
which I know it's not part of that like editing your story but it is part of editing your final draft of your novel
54:20
before you self publish it and then I would upload it it would be ready to go and I would publish the book at that
54:25
point so that is pretty much my editing process okay guys that is it for my
54:35
organization of my own edits this is kind of the process that I follow this and don't feel like you need to have it
54:40
all figured out right from the beginning this is something you're gonna figure out as you go in the comments I would
54:46
love to hear what stage of the writing process you're on and if you enjoyed this editing series and would like to
54:52
see more things similar to it in the future so have you finished your first rough draft have you already edited and
54:59
published multiple novels or is this the first time you've jumped into edit or are you know where new you're close to
55:04
edits because you're still plotting I would love to know just to kind of get an idea of where my subscribers are in
55:09
the writing process I do also want to let you guys know real quick that my HP 90 planning bootcamp which is all about
55:17
90 day planning figuring out your vision for your life and coming up with
55:23
step-by-step process for how you're going to move toward that ideal vision for your life this is a seriously a life
55:31
changing course it's a three-day course but once you have paid for right you have access to it for a lifetime so even if you can't go through
55:38
it in three days or you're very busy this summer if you go ahead and purchase the course you will have lifetime access
55:43
to it but that course only opens a few times a year and it is open for registration now the live bootcamp
55:49
kickoff call will go live on June 20th which is coming up a week from Thursday and then we will boot camp it up for the
55:58
rest of that weekend next weekend but I would love to have you join me I have had over 200 students take this course
56:05
so far and so many of them have seen their lives changed and seen their
56:10
productivity just skyrocket because it's not just about figuring out your ideal future it's really about prioritizing
56:17
the things that are on your to-do list so if you've dealt with feeling overwhelmed feeling like you just have
56:23
so much to do to you'll never get it done comparing yourself to other people and feeling like you're almost getting
56:28
whiplash from like looking at what they're doing and trying to run over here and do that and do this and do this or you're just so busy you can't figure
56:36
out time management this is a great course for you whether you're a writer or not there gonna be a lot of writer
56:41
specific examples given but it really can apply to everything in your life to
56:46
losing weight to managing your day job to managing your home and your life with
56:52
your family all the way through reading more books getting out and taking care of yourself more because like I said it
56:59
in my live video this weekend I hit a point where I was really struggling with
57:04
my own productivity and feeling super overwhelmed and developing this program over the course of several years really
57:11
is what opened my eyes to having a balanced life where I'm realistic about what I want to get done I'm still you
57:18
know working toward my goals I'm still making progress I'm still heading toward that ideal life but I'm actually so much
57:24
more joyful and so much less stressed than I used to be because I know exactly what needs to get done I know where I am
57:31
and I feel really in control of my schedule at all times so if that sounds appealing to you you will get a free
57:38
copy of my HP 90 method planner for q3 and you will get live kickoff call and
57:43
closing call with me as well as access to the entire bootcamp course which is intense and
57:49
amazing and you'll get access to a Facebook group which now is going to be over 200 people of support every single
57:56
week you get support from me every week from now on so it's not just during the course but reporters and quarters to
58:02
come so I would love to have you come join me and the links to join are down below my q3 planner is going up this
58:09
Thursday so look out for that if you've been looking forward to the planner as well another question that I've had is
58:14
when does my self-publishing course launch so publish and thrive is my course on self-publishing it is going to
58:20
be an affordable course that covers everything from idea to strategy to how
58:25
to upload what the difference is between all the vendors and whether you should use Kindle unlimited how to price your
58:30
novels whether you need ISBNs how to market your novels just pretty much everything I know about the business in
58:35
a very affordable course that course will launch on July 8th but it is already up for sale now so I'll include
58:41
some links for you down below as well the sales page isn't complete yet so if you go check that link it's not going to
58:48
be completely live until probably tomorrow but I'm also going to be offering a special bundled package if
58:53
you want to take both courses this summer that will be a special price with an additional discount so keep an eye
58:59
out for that in my next video I'll talk about that on Thursday alright guys thank you so much for letting me talk
59:05
about these courses and these opportunities but also thank you for letting me be a part of your writing process and your editing process if you
59:12
enjoyed this video series I hope that you'll share it with a friend subscribe to my channel and click that like so
59:17
that I know that you enjoyed this video and want to see more of them other than that I will see you in my next video bye

hey guys welcome back to heart
0:01
breathing's we are on video number four
0:03
of my how to edit your novel series and
0:05
today we're gonna be talking about
0:07
something that I know plagues so many
0:09
writers is how do you know when your
0:12
book is done how do you know when it's
0:14
finished and you're done fiddling with
0:16
it and it's ready to go well I'm gonna
0:18
give you a few tips here today so stay
0:20
tuned so this is one of those things
0:27
that is tough for every writer
0:29
especially when it's your first novel
0:31
how do you know when it's good enough
0:33
and how do you know when you're done
0:35
fiddling with it and it's ready to go
0:36
off to an agent or it's ready to send
0:38
off to your editor or you're ready to
0:40
self publish it and so polishing makes
0:43
it even more like ah because you no
0:47
longer have that like agent or you know
0:50
publisher who's telling you okay now
0:51
it's ready and you've got all that
0:53
feedback or they're guiding you through
0:55
the process when it comes to
0:56
self-publishing there's no one who
0:58
decides that it's ready and it's your
1:00
time to publish except for you because
1:02
you're the author and you're ultimately
1:04
your publisher as well so that's made it
1:07
a little bit harder because it used to
1:09
be you know you would send it out when
1:11
you felt like it was ready and an agent
1:13
would you know represent it or not and
1:15
then it would go to a publishing house
1:17
who would decide that it was ready or
1:19
not and then they would help you edit it
1:21
and then they would put a deadline on it
1:23
and it would be done and I'm not saying
1:24
that makes the editing process easy but
1:27
it just makes it even more challenging
1:29
when you're publishing your own novel so
1:31
you know how do you know when it is
1:33
ready to send off to that agent or when
1:35
you are ready to self publish it so
1:38
here's where it gets tricky guys there
1:41
as you know there is no magical editing
1:44
fairy that's going to just come down
1:46
from wherever and sit on your shoulder
1:48
and say oh you know your book is
1:50
finished this is it you know there's no
1:52
like chorus of angels that's going to
1:54
sing there's no you know moment where
1:56
you're going to type for the words and
1:58
suddenly the computer will pop up with a
2:00
message that says that's it you're done
2:02
the book is done unfortunately it would
2:05
be great if that was something that
2:07
happened but sadly that is not ever
Fears
2:09
going to happen it's totally up to you
2:11
and that is where things get
2:13
terrifying like what if it's not good
2:15
enough what if the readers don't love it
2:17
what if you know I put something out
2:19
that's crap or that's nowhere near what
2:21
I feel like I could do and those are all
2:24
natural fears that come about and their
2:27
fears you're just going to have to face
2:29
as an author because like I said
2:31
especially if you're self-publishing
2:32
there's never anyone who's going to give
2:34
you permission and say okay this is it
2:37
you're ready to go unless maybe you hire
2:40
an editor that you ask them to like tell
2:42
me when it's ready and then you have to
2:43
pay them a lot of money to keep going
2:45
through your book over and over again
2:47
and most of us just don't have that kind
2:48
of luxury so you know how do you know
2:51
and the first little tip that I'm gonna
2:55
give you after more than 25 books
2:57
published and finished at this point I
2:59
do have I will give a little note there
3:02
that there are several books at least
3:04
three books in my like closet under the
3:07
bed so to speak that have not been
3:08
published because I was writing for
3:10
years before I published my first novel
3:12
but even going back to that first novel
3:15
back in 2010 you know I can look at it
3:18
now and I can see all the juvenile
3:21
writing all the mistakes although like
3:24
places where I told instead of showing
3:27
or places where I used lazy language or
3:30
you know whatever and that book is very
3:31
shorts 50,000 words or a little bit less
3:33
than 50,000 words but I could go back
3:36
now and I could re addit that book a
3:38
hundred times and then five years from
3:40
now I could read it again because you're
3:41
constantly learning so in that way my
3:44
first tip for you guys is that it's
3:47
never going to be totally finished like
3:50
no work of art is ever completely
3:52
finished and that is one of the great
3:55
challenges is you know you could let
3:57
something sit and then two months later
4:00
you can come back to it and there's
4:01
always something like maybe I could
4:03
fiddle with this word maybe I could
4:05
change this little thing maybe this
4:06
comma would be better here maybe I
4:08
should go into this characters like
4:10
thoughts a little bit more here there's
4:13
always going to be things like I bet I
4:14
could go back to beautiful demons which
4:16
was my first published book in 2010 and
4:19
I bet I could add twenty or thirty
4:20
thousand words to it knowing what I know
4:22
now I could make it a lot better but it
4:26
wouldn't be worth it for me to
4:27
do that because that book was part of my
4:29
journey it was where I was at the time
4:31
and if you were to pick up beautiful
4:34
demons and then also go pick up the most
4:37
recent book in that series which is book
4:39
10 you know and read all the way through
4:40
you would see the journey of my writing
4:43
as you go through it because book 10 is
4:45
you know masterpiece compared to book 1
Perfection
4:48
but I'm sure 10 years from now when I
4:50
look back on book 10 deceiving darkness
4:53
I'm gonna be like oh my gosh look at all
4:55
these mistakes I made and so just the
4:58
mindset of understanding that you're
5:00
never going to have a book that is pure
5:03
perfection and it was exactly what you
5:05
wanted it to be and it came out exactly
5:07
like it needed to be and it was the best
5:09
novel ever written and you'll never come
5:11
back to it and think of you know things
5:13
that you could change about it so that
5:16
is good news because it means you don't
5:18
have to be perfect nothing has to be
5:20
like the best book ever written you
5:23
don't have to put that kind of pressure
5:24
on yourself but it's bad news because
5:28
you how do you know when you're done
5:31
fiddling with it and it's good enough to
5:32
be published and so that's kind of what
5:35
we're going to talk about but I wanted
5:36
to address that first that you know it's
5:38
never going to be where it's just done
5:41
and there's nothing you could change
5:43
about it to make it better or different
5:45
in any way because there's oh you know
5:47
it's art there's always something you
5:49
could change so you have to let go of
5:51
the idea that you're going to someday
5:54
just be so done with this that it's
5:56
perfect and there's not a single word on
5:58
the page that could change or you know
6:00
you would ruin it like there's just
6:02
never going to be that point so go ahead
6:04
and get that in your mind first and
6:06
you'll be better off so back to the
6:09
question at hand when is it done when do
6:12
you know it's done and again the first
6:15
little tip that I'm gonna give you here
6:17
is maybe one that's going to frustrate
6:19
you a little bit but it's the most truth
6:21
that I have learned over the course of
6:23
almost nine years of writing
6:26
professionally which is it's done when
6:29
it feels right and if you've never
6:33
finished a novel before that is going to
6:35
seem like very ethereal advice like what
6:38
when does it feel right first
6:40
feel wrong I will tell you this every
6:43
novel including that first novel that I
6:45
published back in 2010 has had a moment
6:50
in the editing where the way I like to
6:53
describe it is you know when you have
6:55
those like lock combinations right where
6:58
you're spinning the dial and you have to
7:00
turn it one way and then turn it the
7:02
other way and when you turn it that last
7:04
little bit that little tumbler or
7:06
whatever and you feel it click into
7:07
place and you can pull it down you know
7:09
I'm thinking of those like lockers that
7:10
you had in school you know the locks
7:13
like that there's always a moment for me
7:16
with every book where I just feel that
7:19
last little tumbler or that last little
7:21
key fall into place and I know that my
7:24
story has been unlocked and this is the
7:25
way it is and this is the way it was
7:27
meant to be now that doesn't mean that
7:30
there's not a word on the page that I
7:32
could change or something I could fix or
7:34
a typo still sitting in there somewhere
7:36
or like maybe this conversation could be
7:38
tweaked because like I said there's
7:39
always room for improvement but there's
7:43
always this part of me instinctually
7:45
that goes that's it this is the story
7:49
that I was going to tell and I can feel
7:52
it
7:53
so when you hit that point in your story
7:55
where you know where you that little bit
7:58
of magical like you know key or whatever
8:01
falls into place and the story is
8:03
unlocked and this is the major building
8:06
blocks of the story that it has come
8:08
together and it feels the way that you
8:10
want it to feel that is the first step
Trust
8:12
toward knowing that your book is done so
8:14
it's about trusting your instincts and I
8:16
understand 100% that hearing me say that
8:20
might be terrifying for some of you that
8:22
haven't finished your first novel
8:23
because you're thinking I don't know
8:25
what feels right but this is where you
8:28
have to trust yourself and you have to
8:30
trust the process maybe you haven't felt
8:33
that experience yet because you haven't
8:35
pushed yourself to that point maybe
8:38
you've hit the middle or you've finished
8:40
a rough draft and you're still messing
8:41
and fiddling with the edits but you're
8:43
too scared to really just let yourself
8:46
immerse in it or to let yourself be done
8:48
with it take a step and go how does this
8:51
feel how does this feel in terms of
8:54
the story that I knew I wanted to create
8:57
like I was going to tell a story about a
8:59
girl who is abandoned had no parents you
9:03
know was in foster home to foster home
9:06
and comes into this haunted sort of
9:09
spooky house and discovers there are
9:11
secrets in this town that tied to her
9:13
past
9:14
I wanted that story and I want it to
9:16
feel a certain way and I knew that as I
9:18
was writing and so when that story
9:21
unlocked for me and I felt it fall into
9:24
place I knew that I had told the story I
9:27
meant to tell and yes words could be
9:29
changed here and there but after you've
9:31
been through the process like if you go
9:34
back and watch that first video in this
9:37
series how to self edit your novel once
9:40
you've been through that series of steps
9:43
and it's been through you know the
9:45
rounds of edits you've read it out loud
9:47
you've changed all these things it's
9:49
really about how does it feel and once
9:51
it feels like it's come into place and
9:53
you've done the best work you can do to
9:55
make sure the words are the right words
9:56
and you've expressed yourself then the
9:58
book is done and that's when you send it
10:00
off and you start to get feedback and
10:02
it's going to go through a few different
10:04
rounds of you know feedback with other
10:06
people be it critique partners beta
10:07
readers editors whatever agents maybe if
10:11
you're traditionally publishing and you
10:13
know it will get better but those things
10:16
are just refining the process and then
10:18
you're going to say okay now it's it's
10:20
done but it's really about feeling your
10:22
way through it and trusting that when it
10:25
seems to click for you it's like this
10:27
innate knowing that it's this is the
10:30
story I was meant to tell and it's done
10:32
then you can move forward and like I
Learning Every Step
10:36
said if you haven't ever hit that point
10:38
yet it's because you haven't you know
10:40
pushed yourself through to the end of
10:41
this process and I will tell you as much
10:46
as I don't want to say this that
10:47
sometimes there might be stories for you
10:50
if this is your first second or third
10:52
novel that you've tried to write that
10:54
you may never get to that point that
10:56
somehow you have taken so many tours and
10:59
detours and changes and everything that
11:02
your story that you originally meant to
11:04
tell is unrecognizable and you can't see
11:06
how to bring it together
11:07
and sometimes that might mean that you
11:10
need to set that story aside if you've
11:12
been working on it for years and it just
11:13
feels like this big mess and it never
11:15
feels like it's come together the way
11:17
you wanted it to maybe it's time to move
11:19
on to a different story but that's a
11:22
video for another time because I also
11:23
know so many authors who have you know
11:26
hit that point and then just moved on to
11:28
another story and then a year later
11:30
another story and then another story and
11:32
they never bring themselves to that
11:33
point but you have to understand that
11:35
you are learning every step of the way
11:38
so first way that you know when it's
11:41
done is when it feels right when you
11:43
feel like the story you were meant to
11:45
tell that you were intending to tell is
11:48
there on the page and at this point it's
11:51
just about word choice here and there
11:53
but the story is there that's when you
11:55
know you're on the path to done so the
11:58
second piece of this is you know you're
12:00
done at that point you know story has
12:02
come together and it's unlocked itself
12:04
and now you're just endlessly fiddling
12:07
with this word choice or that word
12:09
choice should I do this or should I do
12:10
that and it becomes these very tiny
12:12
minuscule decisions like when you're no
12:15
longer messing with the whole big
12:18
picture like the story isn't you know
12:21
being messed with the characters are all
12:23
in place everything's on the page and
12:25
all you've been doing for the last you
12:27
know however many weeks or months or
12:28
years some of you is changing a word
12:31
here and there like oh maybe this maybe
12:33
I've used too many adjectives let me go
12:35
change this oh maybe this character's
12:37
voice is you know I need to simplify her
12:40
dialogue or should I use the word
12:42
lovingly or you know should I change
12:46
that to not an L Y word or you know
12:48
whatever like when you're getting to
12:51
that point where it's between this word
12:53
or this word like he caressed her cheek
12:55
or he cupped her cheek it doesn't really
12:57
matter at this point yes word choice
12:59
matters but you could spend a lifetime
13:02
going through every single word of your
13:04
novel and not really making it better
13:06
just changing words here and there and
13:08
it's not going to affect the essence of
13:10
the story it's not going to truly make
13:13
it better and in fact you might start
13:15
adding so many like adjectives and
13:17
melodrama and all the stuff that you're
13:18
making it worse so
13:20
pay attention to when you hit a point in
13:23
your manuscript that all you're doing is
13:25
just fiddling with words here and there
13:26
over and over and over and reading back
13:28
through and changing little tiny little
13:30
tweaks your story is done it's time to
13:33
send it off to an editor let them tell
13:36
you what needs to be fixed and then you
13:38
need to let that story go and then
13:39
anything that you feel you need to
13:41
improve can be improved in the next
13:43
novel but when all you're doing is
13:45
fiddling with those little tiny tiny
13:47
details over and over again it's time to
13:49
let the story go if you've been through
13:51
these steps that I gave you in the first
13:54
video and you've been through the
13:56
reading aloud and the self-edit and you
13:58
know the several rounds it's done on
14:01
that same line on that same wavelength
14:05
when you can't think of any way to
14:08
really make your story better when
14:10
you're reading back through it again and
14:12
nothing like stands out to you if like
14:14
gosh I could really make this stronger
14:16
or you know this really needs a little
14:18
bit more explanation or his motivation
14:20
isn't quite there or this plot twist
14:22
doesn't come together right when you're
14:23
done with those big story arc things and
14:26
now you really just can't think of
14:29
anything to make it better your story is
14:31
done it may not be the Great American
14:33
Novel it may not be the best novel ever
14:36
written but you have put together the
14:38
best that you're capable of with this
14:40
story right now and you know it's done
14:41
because there's nothing coming to you
14:43
for how to make it better and all the
14:45
pieces are there so that's in my opinion
14:47
when it's time to let it go let other
14:49
people read it and then move on so since
When Your Book Is Done
14:52
I just mentioned letting other people
14:54
read it when no one comes back to you
14:57
your critique partners your beta readers
14:58
your editors when nobody comes back to
15:00
you with any like major fixes or wow
15:03
this really needs a lot of work and it's
15:05
full of red marks like when it's just
15:07
basically a few little word choice
15:09
things here and there your book is done
15:12
like I said when I was working with a
15:14
critique group back in the day I found
15:17
this critique group mainly for knit
15:18
through NaNoWriMo and like write-ins
15:20
which I highly recommend participating
15:23
in if you get a chance but I found this
15:26
group through there and we were meeting
15:28
once a week and I would read some of
15:30
their stuff they would read chapters of
15:31
mine and in the beginning of my story
15:33
and in my
15:34
there would be big things for them to
15:37
mention like oh gosh you know this part
15:40
doesn't really make sense that they're
15:41
going all this way or they're doing this
15:42
or XYZ and so I'd have big things to
15:45
change but as my writing grew and as I
15:49
got more polished chapters for them to
15:51
read again the changes that they would
15:54
have or to suggest would be like I was
15:56
saying like simple word choices he
15:58
caressed her face instead of he cupped
16:00
her face or he touched her face just
16:02
like one words here and there would be
16:05
all they would have to critique and at
16:07
that point it's just a matter of voice
16:09
right it's just a matter of like the
16:12
feel of the book but you're not really
16:13
making it better if you change it from
16:15
cup to caress tour from touched to I
16:18
don't know what else but like once
16:20
you're just changing those tiny little
16:22
words you're not really making the novel
16:24
better you're just making it slightly
16:26
different so at that point you can kind
16:28
of step back read it through one more
16:29
time ago okay this is as good as it gets
16:32
and I am done with this so when nobody
16:34
that you're getting feedback from on a
16:36
regular basis has anything like really
16:38
big story wise to tell you or you know
16:41
it's not just full of all these typos
16:43
and grammar mistakes and the dialog tags
16:45
are wrong like when there's tons of
16:46
comments you've got work to do but when
16:48
there's just little worn toys fiddling
16:50
you're done you're done baby so the last
16:54
little piece of advice that I have for
16:55
you which this one might sound a little
16:57
bit silly to some people but it's just
17:01
part of the process especially when
17:02
you're indie publishing but you know
17:04
when the deadline comes when you have
17:08
set yourself a deadline like this is
17:10
going to be done by June 30th and I'm
17:12
gonna be completely done fiddling with
17:14
it when you hit that deadline if like I
17:17
said all you're doing is just fiddling
17:18
with a word toys here and there or like
17:20
one scene that didn't come together
17:21
perfectly but it's basically the way you
17:23
wanted it to be it's just you know maybe
17:26
it's not as perfect as you want or
17:28
you're scared because it's a risky scene
17:30
or whatever if you hit that deadline and
17:32
all you're doing is fiddling with word
17:33
choice and there's no more like big
17:35
story arc to change the book is done and
17:37
it's time to move on to the next step in
17:40
the process now this is one that I will
17:42
kind of put with a warning because you
17:45
don't want to
17:47
start publishing a bunch of books that
17:49
are very mediocre that are like not at
17:51
all what you're capable of just because
17:54
okay I hit a deadline and I'm trying to
17:56
rush and publish quickly I will just
17:58
very briefly speak to the fact that
18:00
right now especially in Indy publishing
18:02
and especially with Kindle unlimited if
18:04
you're familiar with what that is there
18:06
is a rush right now everybody feels like
18:09
they are rushed to publish and they're
18:11
trying to put out you know ten books a
18:12
year or however many books a year and so
18:15
there are a lot of people like I said I
18:18
don't try to try to add judgment
18:20
anywhere because there are a lot of
18:21
people that can write that many books
18:23
and they can stay quality and they can
18:24
stay on track with it but there's also a
18:26
lot of people out there who are putting
18:29
out what they know is not their best
18:31
writing just to try to make money
18:32
quickly and I would really warn you
18:35
against that kind of publishing because
18:37
eventually that's going to come back to
18:39
bite you you may make money this year
18:40
because you put out books really fast
18:42
but you're not necessarily building a
18:44
fanbase because readers know what's good
18:47
and what's not good so if you're putting
18:49
out stuff that's constantly like subpar
18:51
full of typos or like just the plot
18:53
doesn't come together fully you're not
18:55
really going to be gathering lifelong
18:57
fans which is what we hopefully would
18:59
want to do if you're trying to build a
19:01
true career as an author so it's
19:04
constantly this balance between you know
19:06
how fast can I write and publish versus
19:08
you know how can I put out the most
19:10
quality book I can and like I said
19:12
that's like an entire can of worms that
19:14
I just opened there and I don't have
19:17
time to go into that but I do want to
19:18
say that you know you don't want to set
19:20
unrealistic deadlines for yourself where
19:22
you're like expecting to finish a book
19:24
in three weeks and then if it's not good
19:26
enough well who cares I'm just gonna put
19:28
it out anyway to make money if that's
19:30
what you want to do then you do you and
19:33
you live your career in your life the
19:34
way you want but in my opinion if you
19:36
want to build a true lasting career
19:39
where you're building up fans that will
19:41
love you forever that will be loyal
19:42
forever and books that you'll be proud
19:44
to look back on five years from now then
19:47
you need to give yourself realistic
19:49
deadlines and say okay I'm gonna give
19:50
myself X amount of months to finish this
19:52
but you do need to give yourself some
19:55
kind of deadline otherwise you could be
19:57
working on the same book for ten years
19:58
and never
19:59
finishing it or like I said you could be
20:02
constantly cycling through books like oh
20:04
I'm gonna try this one and you work on
20:05
it for a year it doesn't feel like it's
20:07
coming together so you move on to the
20:09
next book and move on to the next book
20:10
let me know in the comments if you've
20:12
been caught in that trap before because
20:14
I think we all have kind of hit that
20:16
point where like this book isn't coming
20:18
together I'm going to write something
20:19
different right and sometimes it's
20:21
necessary but most of the time it's just
20:23
your fear talking if you can set a
20:25
deadline a realistic deadline for
20:27
yourself
20:28
even if it's like okay after the rough
20:30
draft is finished and now you're
20:31
starting your edits you could give
20:33
yourself a rough estimate of a deadline
20:35
for each round of those edits like okay
20:37
I'm going to be done with this like
20:38
overarching self edit this first pass by
20:42
two weeks I'm gonna give myself two
20:44
weeks to do that and then I'm going to
20:45
give myself a week to do the line edits
20:47
and then I'm gonna give myself xxx and
20:50
you continue to give yourself these kind
20:52
of mini deadlines then what you can do
20:54
is you can say you know I'm gonna give
20:57
myself until June 30th or whatever the
21:00
date is to be completely done with this
21:02
book if you hit that deadline and like I
21:06
said it feels like the story is in place
21:09
all you're doing is messing with tiny
21:11
little word choices here and there
21:12
nobody has any feedback to give that is
21:15
you know devastating or completely story
21:18
exploding or you know completely needs
21:20
to change your story then you can safely
21:23
say I have finished this book and when
21:26
you pass it off to that final proof
21:28
reader or that final editor it feels
21:30
good to you it may be scary but it feels
21:32
like okay I've done the best I can
21:34
because the danger of course is that we
21:37
hold on to books and we try to make them
21:40
so good and we try to make them the very
21:43
best that you know we try to compare our
21:45
writing to the best authors we've ever
21:47
read and we try to make it as good as
21:50
they are but that person might have
21:51
written and published 100 novels and
21:53
you're on your very first so you can't
21:55
really it's not fair to yourself to
21:57
compare yourself to that other writer
21:59
you have to start where you are
22:01
understand where you are and do the best
22:03
you can but eventually you do need to be
22:05
done with your novel and you have to
22:07
move on like I said you know when I
22:09
finished beautiful demons back in 2010 I
22:12
wrote that book with the intention of
22:14
self-publishing it and I felt like that
22:18
little lock clicked into place the story
22:21
was what I wanted it to be and I knew
22:24
deep down that it was the best I could
22:27
do at the time I can look back at it now
22:29
and see all the changes that I could
22:31
make but that's always going to be the
22:33
case there's always tiny word choices
22:35
there's you're always going to be
22:37
growing as a writer you're always going
22:39
to be learning more as you go and
22:41
through experience so you can't just
22:44
hold on to things forever tweaking
22:46
little words here and there is the story
22:48
what it was meant to be does it feel
22:50
good to you have you hit your deadline
22:52
have you been through those other
22:54
processes in terms of you've self edited
22:57
the storyline you've gone back through
22:59
craft and the story you've self edited
23:02
you know line edited your book on your
23:04
own you've read it aloud you've gone
23:06
through like put it through grammar
23:08
check or through spellcheck you've sent
23:11
it off to a line editor or critique
23:13
group or something like that
23:15
once you've followed all those steps
23:17
it's time to let that story fly to let
23:20
it go and to move on because that's how
23:22
we grow into the novelist that we're
23:24
meant to be we do the best we can with
23:27
this story and then we let it go we let
23:30
it free we put it out there and then we
23:32
move on to the next one so if you take
23:35
nothing else from this video just take
23:36
this that you know there really will
23:39
never be a point in time where anyone
23:42
gives you permission to publish or says
23:44
this is as good as it's going to be you
23:46
have to learn you have to learn how to
23:49
trust yourself that you will know when
23:52
it's good enough and you have to be able
23:54
to step away from your own fear enough
23:57
to be able to say this may not be the
24:01
best I will be able to do in my entire
24:03
lifetime but I feel proud of this I feel
24:05
like this is the best I could do I feel
24:07
like this is the story I set out to tell
24:09
and it's good enough and I'm gonna let
24:12
it go and I think that that comes with
24:16
experience but it also comes with just
24:19
trusting yourself as an artist and that
24:21
is something that you're gonna have to
24:25
learn to do if you
24:26
do this professionally so hopefully you
24:28
have gotten something out of this I hate
24:30
that I can't give you an exact set of
24:33
steps because there just really isn't
24:34
and so even though this might be a
24:36
question that has plagued you for a long
24:38
time I hope that you understand that you
24:40
do have inside of you the knowledge of
24:43
whether your story is right or not so
24:46
you have to learn to trust that and then
24:47
you have to move forward I'm wishing you
24:49
the best and I hope that you have
24:51
enjoyed this series so far on editing we
24:54
just have one more video to go which
24:56
will launch this Sunday and that is how
24:59
I organize my edit so I'm going to show
25:01
you a inside view of exactly how I
25:04
organize my editing process which is
25:07
going to go some into my favorite
25:08
planner type stuff like how I actually
25:10
physically organize it some into my
25:12
Google Docs so you can see how I do it
25:14
with my beta readers and everything else
25:16
so I'm going to give you some examples
25:17
of how those edits look and what my
25:19
process is when I know the book is
