hey guys welcome back to heart breathing's I'm excited to bring you the second video in the how to edit your novel series today we are going to talk
0:06
about the different types of professional freelance editors that are out there how much they cost where to
0:12
find them and that sort of thing so hopefully you will stay tuned okay so as
0:20
we get started we're going to discuss today the different types of editors and what each edit entails and how much they
0:27
cost those are kind of the big topics here today so if you are traditionally publishing your novel you may still want
0:34
to use some of these types of editors before you send it out to agents on submission so that you can have the best
0:39
possible version of your manuscript or you might not because when you get an agent they're gonna help you through
0:45
some of these things they're gonna help you polish up your story and make it great they're probably not going to line edit your novel but they might help you
0:51
with the story then you'll send it out to a publishing house and those publishing houses will have professional
0:56
editors who do this sort of thing like the line edits the copy edits the proofreading and that sort of thing so
1:02
you might not want to do this as a traditionally published author or an author who is seeking traditional
1:08
publication but if you are an indie author or you're planning to self publish then you're probably going to
1:14
want to hire one or more of these types of editors for each of your stories so let's get into what the different types
1:20
of edits mean and how much it costs so with most freelance editors who are
1:26
talking about fiction which we're talking about novels not nonfiction like how-to books but actual fiction we're
1:34
going to be looking at three different types of editors a developmental editor a copy editor or line editor which are
1:40
often used interchangeably or a proofreader so we're going to talk about these individually and what all each one
1:46
involves now before we get into that though I do want to just give a little bit of a disclaimer that before you
1:52
begin working with any of these editors with anyone you want to work with as an editor you want to make sure that you've
1:57
gotten a list and a good expectation of exactly what they do you can't just say well Sarah said the development or
2:04
mental editor does this this and this because every editor is a little bit different in what services they offer
2:09
I'm just going to be giving you kind of a general overview of what this typically means when someone is a
2:14
developmental editor but you still want to do your due diligence where you look at their website you see exactly what a
2:20
developmental edit entails because sometimes when you pay for a developmental edit it will also include
2:27
a proofread later down the line or a second pass sometimes it will sometimes
2:32
it won't so you want to make sure you know exactly what you're getting before you pay for it before you contract with that person so with that out of the way
2:39
let's talk about developmental editors so a developmental editor is someone that you're going to use earlier on in
2:46
the process so in the last video where we talked about self edits you didn't send out your edited manuscript to an
2:52
editor until step 7 but if you decide you want to work with the developmental editor you're gonna want to send them
2:59
that your story way ahead of time because what a developmental editor does is they're going to help you with those
3:05
big picture items that we talked about in the editing video if you haven't watched that first video I will have it
3:10
linked down for you below basically a developmental editor is looking at story structure characterization the flow of
3:17
your story in general and they're looking at those big picture items that make up your story structure your
3:24
characterization the setting the tone of your story they're looking at the overall content of your novel a lot of
3:31
times a developmental edit will feel like the most collaborative of all the edits because it's ultimately your story
3:38
but a good developmental editor will understand the genre that you're writing in and they'll be able to say to you you
3:44
know this pacing is a little bit slow I think you need another murder here and they're gonna give you actual feedback
3:50
on how to fix your story if there's plot holes if it needs more action if the romance isn't coming together because
3:56
these two characters aren't seeming to like really have chemistry on the page they're gonna give you usually advice on
4:03
how to increase that chemistry or how to give your hero more backstory so it's more collaborative because they're gonna
4:08
say to you why don't you try this and you might have to defend yourself and say well I didn't do that on purpose because this isn't this or it'll be kind
4:16
of back and forth with a good developmental editor and like I said a really good developmental editor is
4:22
someone who understands the genre that you're writing and they know kind of the reader expectations and part of their job is
4:27
usually to help you make your story more marketable so they're not going to have you copying someone else's work or
4:34
someone else's tone but what they will do is they'll kind of guide you in the right direction of like you can't really
4:40
call this a romance if these people break up at the end of it more like women's fiction or something or for some
4:46
people horror but you know if it's a romance and it's in the room at genre they need to have a happily ever after
4:52
and they're gonna guide you in that they're also gonna make sure that you have that tension on the page or that if it is a certain trope of a story like
4:59
it's a secret baby story they're gonna know that secret baby stories usually have these certain elements and they're
5:04
gonna make sure that you have those elements in your own story so they're really collaborating with you to make
5:10
your story structure your characters their motivation and all that big stuff much stronger so you can see why you'd
5:16
want to work with a developmental editor earlier on in the process and there are
5:21
different types of developmental editor some editors will offer just kind of like a manuscript critique instead of
5:27
giving you really detailed suggestions they're just gonna give you kind of an overview of like I think this story
5:33
needs these elements to be a little bit strengthened or they're gonna go full in developmental edit and they're gonna
5:38
give you a lot of feedback on your story let's talk about what a developmental editor is not a developmental editor is
5:45
not someone who is going to go through your story line by line they're not going to find your typos they're not
5:51
going to fix your grammar or work on your commas they're not going to you know fix word choices or awkward
5:58
sentences they are not looking at things on that detailed level they're looking at this big picture that we talked about
6:04
in the last video they're looking at the big items the story structure they're looking at the skeleton of your house
6:10
and making sure that you have the bones of a great story and they're looking at those sort of characterization and that
6:16
sort of stuff but they're not looking at each individual line of dialogue they're not looking for typos they're not going
6:22
to polish up your story the way that a proofreader would give you every little mechanical detail of your story so don't
6:27
expect that when you pay for a developmental edit that you're going to get that sort of line at it you're just
6:32
going to get that big picture overview all right so how much does the developmental edit cost
6:38
as with all three of these types of edits the costs are going to vary wildly
6:44
like when it comes to freelance editors you could have one developmental edit is
6:49
going to cost you five hundred dollars and a different developmental editor is going to cost you ten thousand and when
6:54
I say very wildly that's what I'm talking about it all depends on the editor and what they charge what their
7:01
expertise is so you really need to make sure you know upfront what their prices are and you know for most Indies it is
7:09
not going to make a lot of sense to spend $7,000 or $10,000 on a developmental edit because your chances
7:17
of making that kind of money back when you also have cover art and marketing to do is very slim but you also may not
7:24
want to choose the cheapest person because maybe their sole credential is I just really love to read and that's not
7:30
really gonna be somebody who's going to give you professional feedback so you really want to be discerning when you
7:36
choose your editor but we're going to talk about that a little bit more later in the video let's talk about average cost like what you can really expect to
7:42
pay developmental edits can often be the most expensive edits because they're actually going in and structuring your
7:47
story for you not always sometimes line edits are the most expensive but it depends again on the particular editor
7:54
most editors then this goes for all three categories we're going to talk about today we'll give you a per word
8:00
cost so it'll be like 10 cents a word or whatever some people old school will
8:06
still give you a per page and that's based on very many different things so
8:11
if someone gives you a quote that's per page make sure you understand exactly what that means because in the old days
8:18
when things when people were typing things out on typewriters an average was 250 words per page but when you put that
8:25
into a word processor depending on what thought you're using you might have 500 words per page so when you look at your
8:31
word document and it says 95 pages you think you're going to get charged 95 pages times five dollars a page because
8:39
they told you five dollars a page but some editors will say oh but a page to me means 250 words so now you're getting
8:46
charged double what you expected so my advice to you is to get a quote upfront you say this
8:52
is how many words it is how much about on average is that going to cost me so that you kind of know what the upper
8:58
limit is for this edit I always prefer to get a per word estimate because we're
9:05
in the digital age now it should be per word not per page because pages don't really mean anything anymore in digital
9:11
editing just my opinion there if they give you a per page quote make sure you know what page the definition of a page
9:18
is that's my only warning so typically a developmental editor is going to charge between one cent a word all the way up
9:26
to about ten cents per word so I'm gonna give you costs based on a seventy thousand work novel which is kind of
9:32
like an average-sized novel if you're calling something a novel we can talk about this in another video but if
9:37
you're calling something a novel it's at least forty thousand words and up so we're gonna go for sort of an average novel word count which is seventy
9:44
thousand words to give you an idea but you can also use your own calculator to get a good sense of that so a seventy
9:50
thousand word novel will cost you anywhere from about seven hundred dollars for a developmental edit to
9:55
seven thousand dollars for a developmental edit on the most expensive side most freelance editors that I've
10:01
seen who work with Indies are more along the like two to three cents per word for
10:06
developmental edit so that's kind of where I would typically look as between probably one to three cents per word one
10:12
set is somebody you've got who probably is a newer editor three cents that's gonna be someone who's pretty pro ten
10:19
cents better be like Stephen King's editor for me if I'm going to spend that as an indie which I probably wouldn't
10:25
okay guys so I just wanted to come on and insert this as I'm editing I'm realizing that talking about these costs
10:32
it sounds extremely expensive to have your book edited I want you to know that this is one of the more expensive places
10:40
where you have to invest as an indie author edits are going to vary wildly so
10:46
even though I say 700 to 7,000 that doesn't mean that you can't look around and find a developmental editor who's
10:52
just getting started or who offers you know better pricing and you can get it done for more like $300 or something a
10:59
little bit cheaper I'm just giving you the average costs for the more professional editors
11:05
if you guys would like to see a separate video on how to edit your novel get your
11:14
cover art and publish your books on a budget please go ahead and leave that in
11:19
the comments below because what I don't want to happen is that you don't hear anything else that I'm saying about the
11:24
types of edits and editors because all you can think about as you're going through this video is how expensive it's
11:30
going to be to get your novel edited when you are just getting started and you don't have any income coming in from
11:36
your books you really don't want to be spending thousands and thousands of dollars up front to have your cover art
11:42
and all these different types of edits because if you spend say five thousand six thousand dollars
11:49
producing your very first book you're probably not going to make that money back very quickly because you're going
11:54
to need several books to start making a good living as an indie so you don't want to invest a ton of money you want
12:02
to find a good way to do this on a budget but what I'm just giving you is the basic costs an average costs of the
12:10
different editors that are out there I will definitely gladly do a video on
12:15
how to do this on a budget when you're first getting started I personally did not use a developmental editor or
12:22
anything like that when I first got started I was mostly using critique groups and beta readers and then a
12:28
proofreader and so it was a lot less expensive these days things are a lot
12:33
more competitive so you really want to have a super polish novel but there are ways to do that without spending seven
12:40
to ten thousand dollars producing your first novel because the more you get yourself in the hole right from the
12:45
beginning the worse off it's going to be because it's just going to take you a lot more time to sort of recoup your
12:51
costs and your money so what I don't want to happen is for you guys to be watching this video and suddenly decide
12:56
that all you can hear is how much it's going to cost and start to feel defeated by that amount of money just know that
13:02
when it comes to the costs here that there are ways to save money so if you're interested in hearing about how
13:08
to do this on a budget please go ahead and leave that in the comments below but for now since I didn't put that
13:13
information in the main video this is just going to talk about some of the more average costs which in general are
13:18
going to be a little bit more expensive I just didn't want you guys to get freaked out by that all right back to your regular scheduled programming
13:25
moving on to line edits or copy edits now when you get to traditional publishing a line editor might be very
13:32
different from a copy editor because a copy editor might be just what they're calling a proofreader but we're not talking about traditional
13:38
publishing we're talking about you hiring a freelance editor so in most cases line edits and copy edits are used
13:45
interchangeably so it's the same thing basically but you do want to go on to
13:50
your chosen editors website and make sure that you understand if they have a difference between line edits and copy
13:56
edits you want to know what those differences are for my purposes in today's video a line in it and a copy
14:01
edit are going to be the same thing so I'm just going to call it a line at it so in a line edit the editor is going to
14:06
go through your manuscript line by line we talked about this in my first video on how to self edit because hopefully
14:12
you've done this for yourself as well but now you're gonna take someone who's a real professional and they're gonna go through your story line by line they're
14:19
gonna look at all the board choice that they're gonna be analyzing your sentences they're gonna be looking for flow awkward sentencing they're gonna be
14:26
looking for consistency often where they're really looking to see like if you if he had blue eyes over here he's
14:33
got blue eyes over here and he didn't switch it up they're gonna be looking for parody to make sure that when you
14:38
have a sentence it's done in the most clear way as possible they may not go through and change a lot of your
14:44
sentences like nitpicky wise but if something is really glaring that like this is not the clearest way you could
14:50
have said it they will help give you suggestions on how to fix it they're looking for continuity in the story like
14:55
oh you had this thread here about this ribbon and act1 and it never comes up again so they're gonna mention that sort
15:01
of thing usually they're looking for tense so if you're in present tense you're in present tense threw out there
15:06
looking for head hopping and POV switches to make sure you've handled those well and the each character has their own individual and unique voice
15:13
sometimes they're going to be looking for cliches like you know if you've used something improperly a really good line
15:20
editor will actually quote to you what the rule is like you're using this phrase but that's not actually what it
15:25
means because in Boston in 1920 blah-dee blah-blah and they'll give you rules because they know that cool kind of
15:30
stuff that most of us others do not know so they'll pick out cliches or you know
15:35
awkward wording they'll pick out repeated phrases a lot of the stuff that we talked about in my first video about
15:41
things I want you to do in that second step where you're line editing your own novel that's what a line editor is going
15:48
to do now let's talk about what they will not do they're usually not looking at your overall plot structure they're
15:54
not going to point out plot holes they're not going to point out that your character needs a better backstory
15:59
they're not looking at those big picture things they're assuming that by the time the novel gets to them those big things
16:05
are already taken care of now we're kind of focusing in so if you imagine that the developmental editor is way out here
16:11
on the big picture the copy editor or the line editor is someone who's zooming
16:16
in on each line of your story and fixing the words and the sentence flow and that
16:22
sort of thing so what they're not doing is looking at those big picture story structure things but they are looking
16:28
specifically for word choice word flow cliches that you're using words
16:33
correctly that you're being consistent and that sort of thing a lot of times they will also point out typos and
16:39
punctuation errors but they're not going to be as detailed with that as a
16:45
proofreader might get for example so I highly recommend that even if you use
16:50
the developmental editor or a line editor along the way you also use a proofreader which we're going to talk
16:55
about what a proofreader is in just a minute but sometimes a line editor will also talk a little bit about your plot
17:02
if something is glaring to them like this doesn't really make sense or this doesn't come together but they're never going to be as detailed as a
17:08
developmental editor when it comes to the big story structure stuff mostly what they're looking at is the line by
17:14
line word choices and sentence flow so how much does a line editor or copy editor cost so we're looking usually
17:21
between one cent and four cents per word for a copy editor so for a seventy
17:26
thousand word novel you're again looking at between $700 and $2,800
17:32
I have found I put this as a kind of a baseline but I have worked with pretty
17:38
good line editors in the past that I only spent maybe like four or five hundred dollars for so they were
17:43
probably charging more like half a cent per word and when I started doing some more research on pretty
17:49
current prices you're generally going to be in that one to four cents per word and like this you probably usually be
17:56
more in the like one point six cents or two cents four cents a word is pretty expensive I would say for a line editor
18:02
but you will find some people that charge that much I would personally be looking for the one to two cent or below
18:09
for a line editor so let's move on to the third one which is one of the ones that I feel like you should not skip no
18:15
matter what which is a proofreader so a proofreader is sort of those last eyes
18:20
everything else in your story is put together your sentence flow is good the story is structured nicely you've got
18:26
great characters on the page everything is good to go but this is the last set of eyes that are not your own that are
18:32
going to actually look through your story and pick out all those mechanical errors so this person again is not
18:38
looking at your big picture story structure they're not going to mention that this word is off this is awkwardly
18:43
worded or that the sentence isn't flowing this person is laser focused in on the grammar and the typos the
18:50
punctuation that sort of thing the heavy mechanics of your story so where are your commas do you have a posture fees
18:57
used in the correct way is your dialogue properly formatted do you have this is
19:03
sometimes it's the consistency stuff too like if you have the order of shadows which is my evil organization of witches
19:09
in my shadow demon saga is capitalized oh and the S is capitalized is it capitalized everywhere so they're
19:15
looking at the mechanics and the consistency there so basically all we're looking at grammar typos punctuation
19:21
sometimes consistency and that's pretty much what they're looking at this is not someone who's gonna look for sentence
19:27
flow word choices you know developmental type things so don't expect that much
19:33
out of them but a proofreader is also usually going to be the fastest to get the edits back to you and they're also
19:39
going to be the least expensive a proofread will usually cost between 0.0
19:46
0.2 0.0 0.7 thousand word novel is going
19:56
to cost roughly between 200 and the and dollars for a seventy thousand word novel sometimes with a proofreader you
20:03
can find people who are willing to do your novel for a flat fee so instead of per word they'll say if your novel is
20:09
between fifty and seventy five thousand words I'll do it for a hundred dollars and sometimes you can find those kind of
20:15
deals and often those people can be really good so sometimes look for those and you can get kind of a deal on it and
20:20
you'll usually get it back within a week copy edit sly nuts I didn't actually talk about this in my guide but copy and
20:26
line edits can sometimes take at least two to three weeks to get back a developmental edit can sometimes take a
20:32
month it just depends on the editor so now that we've covered all of those things about what types of editors and
20:37
what they do and how much they cost let's just go over a brief list of tips that I have for you for when you are
20:43
ready to hire an editor so this is a tricky thing here because as indie and
20:48
self-publishing becomes more popular there are also a lot more predators on the market who hang up their shingle
20:55
they put up a website and they will tell you they charge X amount of dollars in the their amazing editor and then you'll
21:02
work with them and you will find out that they have no idea what they're doing and they're just trying to make money off of desperate Indies who are
21:08
looking for a good editor and so you want to do your due diligence to make sure that you know that whoever you're
21:14
hiring actually knows what they're doing they have some level of training and experience in this and they're worth the
21:19
money that you're paying them so here are some tips for when you're hiring an editor asked for their credentials or
21:25
check their website and see what their training is it doesn't mean they have to have some kind of like bachelor's in you
21:32
know grammar or something like that but it does mean they need to have some sort of training in editing they've either
21:38
taking a course they've been certified in it they've been editing professionally for years they have a lot of experience something they know their
21:46
stuff make sure that there's some credentials I have worked with people before or had editors that were
21:52
recommended to me when I was in a pinch where I would ask them so you know what are your credentials what's your experience and they would just say well
21:58
I just have always loved to read okay well I love to read too that doesn't mean I understand every single use of
22:05
every single comma or you know all the grammar rules that are out there that's why I need a professional editor are you
22:11
grammar nerd or not because I don't want to hire you for a line at it if you have no idea between how the sentence flows
22:18
and whether this one because I don't want to pay you $700 for you to just come back and be like wow that was a great book
22:24
I want feedback and I want a professional feedback so I just love to read is not good enough that hopefully
22:30
if something most editors love to do because it's their job but hopefully they also have extensive experience or
22:36
training in some way so find out what that is sometimes they'll list it on their web site sometimes you just need
22:41
to ask you can also ask for a sample edit some editors are too busy to do this but a lot of editors will do this
22:47
for you where you can send them the first chapter of your manuscript or a small excerpt and they will line it for
22:53
you and they will give you sort of an idea of how well they do I did this with
22:59
an editor I was working with recently where I asked for a line edit and just for a sample edit and when it came back
23:05
they were actually correcting things that were right and changing them into something that was wrong so I
23:11
immediately knew even though I don't know everything about grammar I immediately knew this was not the person
23:16
for me because they didn't know their facts they didn't know their rules so if I had not done that sample edit with
23:22
them I would have probably wasted five hundred dollars working with someone who just isn't up to par so make sure that
23:30
you ask for a sample edit if you're unsure about their credentials or about whether or not they're going to be a good fit for you sample edits will be
23:36
free by the way it may only be a page but at least you get an idea of what they're doing and you shouldn't be charged for it also make sure that you
23:42
get a quote upfront so like I said you don't want someone to say oh I charge about between this and this depending on
23:48
what type of shape your manuscript is in or that oh I do this per page and then you didn't understand that a page to
23:54
them is a hundred every hundred words or whatever they decided to do it was tricky tell them this is my novel this
24:00
is how long it is how much is the edit going to be sometimes it does happen where you ask for a line edit or you ask
24:09
for a proofread and the editor tells you it's going to be $200 and then they get
24:14
your book and it's in so much worse shape an editor is assuming that if you're asking for a proofread they are
24:20
the just the final pass and they're just going to be catching these mechanical errors if your story is a mess and it's
24:25
typos after typo and it's just it's just a horror story for them they're gonna
24:30
charge you a lot more than 2-hundred but a professional editor will come back to you usually at that point and they'll say I'm so sorry but this manuscript
24:38
really needs more work so it's gonna be more like five hundred dollars they will let you know up front an editor who does
24:44
not tell you upfront is really not being professional if they come back to you after the edit is done and they say oh I
24:50
know I told you 200 but it's actually gonna be 700 and they expect you to pay that and the work is already done they
24:57
are not a professional person now sometimes you're gonna have to pay it to avoid a lawsuit or whatever else but
25:02
beware of people like that make sure if you can to get a good quote upfront that you understand how they work and how
25:09
much it's going to cost and then ask them say if you're going to go over this 210 dollar quote please let me know
25:16
ahead of time so that I can make a decision at that point whether to continue or not another great thing to do is to talk to other authors so a lot
25:23
of times there will be testimonials on an editor's website or you will have found them through referrals talk to
25:28
other authors who have used them and make sure that they're really a good reference now this is not always foolproof because like I said I've had
25:34
editors recommended to me that just were not up to par and I would not recommend to other people but obviously these
25:40
authors thought they were good enough so it's just you know it's not gonna always be the number one thing that you can
25:46
rely on but beware of an editor who refuses to give you any client names like let's say they have no testimonials
25:53
and you say I would love to know who you've worked with so I could reach out to them and find out you know kind of how your work style is or get a
25:59
reference if they refuse to give you any names you might want to just move on because that means they probably have
26:04
literally no one they can tell you what that would give them a good reference so that means like beware get the heck out
26:10
of Dodge another great thing to know is their timeline so know how long it's going to take them because you don't
26:16
want to turn in your manuscript for a proofread and expect that I'll probably get that back in a week and then you
26:21
don't hear from them for two months because especially when you're self-publishing you need to know when that book is coming back and when it's
26:27
going to get published because you've got release dates and cover art and all these things to manage so know their timeline in advance like know how long
26:34
it typically takes them get things back to you and then reaffirm that when you actually turn it in so
26:39
when you first query them and you say hey I want to get on your schedule how long does it typically take you to get a
26:45
proofread back to me and they say oh it's usually about a week you say okay great then when you turn your novel in
26:50
to them and you're ready to start the proofread say so I can expect this back from you by Friday and they at that point might say oh you
26:57
know what I'm a little bit backed up you're not going to get it back probably till next Wednesday okay now you kind of know but always get that
27:04
confirmation so you know what to expect another thing to keep in mind is to book early a lot of the best editors these
27:11
days are booked months in advance so you can't expect to necessarily to finish your rough draft today itself edit in
27:18
two weeks and then contact your editor at that point and hand it over to them in three days most editors are not going
27:24
to work that way most of the time you need to let them know a couple of months in advance that hat I'm gonna need this
27:30
proofread and so on which means that you have to be a little bit more strict on your own schedule some editors if you
27:37
miss your deadline will just push you back on the schedule and it's fine I've also worked with editors before sadly
27:43
who if you don't make that date they just have to move on because they're too busy to wait for you to finish the book
27:50
so this is just one of those things that's sort of like a headache but it's your responsibility when you're working
27:55
with an editor to know how far in advance they're booking out and what their policies are in terms of
28:00
flexibility if you don't turn it in I worked with an editor that if it was due on Monday the 25th you had to have it in
28:07
first thing Monday morning and if you missed that even if it was the 20 of the 26th she just didn't have time for you
28:13
anymore and she had moved on and you were done and you had to find a new editor and it is not fun to be scrambling to find a new editor at the
28:19
last minute because most people are booked so it's just something you need to know ahead of time and if you can to
28:25
go ahead and book it early and know what their flexibility rules are alright guys so that's most what I have for you on
28:31
editors also I know a big question that a lot of you have is where do I find an editor so this is a great question
28:38
obviously you can just google search freelance editor for self-published novel and that sort of thing and you can
28:44
find people and you can go through this due diligence that I was just talking about if you're in groups with they're authors you can ask them does
28:50
anybody have good references for editors who are available and letting them know what type of editor you're looking for
28:57
I'm looking for a proofreader who's going to charge less than two hundred dollars for my seventy thousand word novel and is available starting in
29:04
August does anybody have any recommendations so being an author Facebook groups can be helpful for that
29:09
being in local author groups who they can help you you may even be able to find local authors through writing
29:15
groups like rwa or NaNoWriMo another good way to find editors is when you
29:20
find an indie book especially that you love check the front of the book because a lot of times Indies will list that
29:26
this book was edited by and they'll put attribution in there for their editor and their editors website or they'll say
29:33
cover art done by this person and they'll put links in there and it will usually be on the copyright page so you
29:39
don't even necessarily have to buy the book you can just go to Amazon and do the look inside and you can see that
29:45
information right there so if you there's an indie author that you admire maybe troll their books a little bit and
29:50
see if they list their editor or reach out to them if there's somebody that you see their book is really well polished
29:56
try sending them an email or reaching out to them on Instagram and saying your books are so well done I'm a new author
30:02
I would love to find an editor do you have any recommendations so those are often like word-of-mouth going to be the
30:08
best ways to find editors out there I am working on compiling a list of editors there used to be one on my Sara Canon
30:15
website and they're actually probably still is but it's very out of date and I haven't really worked on it so far so I
30:21
don't have a great list for you guys now but if you're interested in an actual list of editors you can go to keyboards
30:27
comm which used to be Kindle boards and find the writers cafe and they used to have a really good resource list of
30:33
editors as well I'm not sure if that's been updated but it might be something you can find but for the most part the
30:38
best way to find editors is either through Google searches for exactly what you're looking for and then just doing
30:43
your own research or my recommendation is to join Facebook author groups and
30:48
ask around and see if you can get that or look inside other Indies books that you admire and get the editors name from
30:54

2:37
your email today I have already sent you this guide so just a little bit there so that you have the guide in your hands
2:43
while we're going through this video now let's get started talking about how to self edit your novel this is a really
How Much Editing
2:51
big one because really how much editing and how much time it's going to take you
2:56
to edit your novel very much depends on how you wrote your rough draft did you
3:02
fast draft it with barely putting any details into it did you labor over every word and really plot it out and get it
3:09
all settled and you've got the whole story structure there or not everybody kind of comes through their rough draft
3:15
a little bit differently I have one friend who completely fast drops her novel she doesn't even put in dialogue
3:20
tags she just fast drafts it there's very little emotion there's very little description it's just the story and the
3:27
nuts and bolts or the bones of the story it's very minimal so when she goes back and she edits her novel she does a very
3:33
specific round of edits for each thing so she'll go through it one time and add
3:39
in description and setting then she'll go through it another pass and she'll add in more character dialogue and
3:45
motions and that sort of thing and then she'll go through an edit for story and she has like six different specific
3:52
editing passes that she goes through so you may find that my system doesn't totally work for you and that's fine
3:58
because we're writers we're artists were creatives you're gonna find your own way through your edits but what I'm able to
4:04
do for you today is just to assume that you've come through your rough draft you have the basics of a story there you've
4:11
got a pretty good story but it needs work and I'm going to show you kind of one of the best ways that I've found to
4:17
systematically work my way through my revisions so hopefully this will work for you but of course feel free to
4:23
modify it to your own level of writing your own way of drafting because if you've really liked
4:29
the story is definitely set everything's perfect you may not need some of these first couple of passes to take as long
4:36
as what I do for them you may just need more of a proofread and that's fine too if you've been kind of editing as you go
4:42
but I'm gonna assume for the purposes of this particular video that you're coming through and you have a true rough draft
4:48
so where do you start now you will hear a ton of people from best-selling authors to editors to just
4:56
about everybody in the world will tell you that you need to rest your manuscript you need to put it in a drawer or whatever proverbial drawer and
5:03
you need to sit on it for a little while maybe a month or whatever and just let it rest I don't do that I'll just go
Dont Let Your Book Rest
5:11
ahead and put that up front I found that I tried to follow that advice early on in my career and I felt
5:17
disconnected to my story the reason that people tell you to come back to it later to let it rest for a while is that the
5:25
idea is that when you come back to it with fresh eyes after several weeks or months without working on it you're
5:31
going to see it differently because you're not so close to it you're gonna start to see errors that you might not
5:36
have seen if you had just been working on it I totally understand the point
5:42
behind that the intention behind that however as an indie author who is you
5:47
know working successful author right now I can't afford to set my book aside for
5:53
a month or two months and then come back to as fresh eyes and then edit it for another two months because I need to be
5:58
publishing more quickly than that and I also found that the longer I let it sit the more disconnected I felt to it
6:04
because I would be writing something else or I'd be writing the next book in the series and that was another big thing for me I couldn't go on and write
6:11
book 6 until I had book 5 edited and I knew exactly what happened in that book so because I can't afford to take that
6:17
much time in between books I don't like let my book rest so you can let yours rest if you feel that's best
6:23
for you or like me you can just dive right into the edits the day after you finish your rough draft it's not going
6:28
to kill you and even though it goes against some advice other authors will give you I find it to be a great process
6:34
for me so with that out of the way here's step 1 for me what I like to do in step 1 is I
6:40
take my entire rough draft and I will create a new outline if you plotted your
6:46
novel before you were writing the rough draft or as you're writing the rough draft you probably already have an
6:53
outline that's basic but it probably changed along the way because outlines tend to characters tend to change the
7:00
story outlines tend to change as you move and you discover more about the story so the first step for me is I go
7:06
through the entire rough draft and I make a new outline and what this looks like for me is I usually just put
7:11
chapter 1 and I will write a summary of what happens in that chapter Harper goes to the village and they look
7:19
for these spell books and this is this and this and this if there's a hook there in that first chapter I will also
7:24
put what the hook is so for example I'm working on a book right now called the disappearance of Vanessa sha so I would
7:30
put prologue the night Vanessa disappears Lorelei follows her out into the woods
7:35
hook vanessa has never seen or heard from again Lorelei's the last one to see her so
7:41
that would be the summary for the prologue chapter one Lorelei arrives at
7:47
the cabin two years later on the anniversary of Vanessa's disappearance all the same kids are there you know etc
7:53
etc so I would just put that in as I go throughout my outline I will also put in
7:58
things that belong in the overall story structure if you haven't watched my
8:04
series on how to plot your novel I will link that down below for you as well because that's something you may want to
8:09
go back and watch so that you understand these sort of beats that I'm talking about but I will go in my outline and I
8:15
will actually put in the argument against transformation is happening in this chapter the key event or the
8:23
inciting event is happening in this chapter and I will put what that is so that I'm kind of keeping my eye not only
8:28
on a summary of what's happened but also where this fits into overall story
8:33
structure for me this chapter six is the end of Act one and I've got the Act one climax here I would put here's what
8:40
happens in Chapter six just a brief summary a sentence or two and then I would put Act one climax and I might
8:46
like color code that put that in a different color or highlighted a certain way and then I would put in what the Act
8:52
one climax is dun-dun-dun a new body is discovered you know something like that I will actually when we get to the end
8:59
of this video series and I'm showing you how I organize my edits I will actually show you examples of how I've written
9:04
this down but for times sake I'm not going into that today just know that I write down an outline of every single
9:10
scene or chapter and what happens in it where it fits in the story structure what this does for me is it solidified
9:18
the story in my head I know what I intended to write now I see what I've
9:23
actually written so even if I don't read through every single word you know at
9:29
this point I'm not looking for typos I'm not looking for grammar mistakes I'm not even messing with characterization or
9:35
anything like that I'm just writing down an outline of what I have so far I also I put this in the guide on editing I
9:43
also have a process where if I hit a scene that's not flowing and I'm in flow and it's just like okay this is a battle
9:50
scene or this is a really tough conversation that needs to happen and I'm not ready to write it yet I will put in X X which is like a capital X X which
9:58
is something that doesn't occur in many words and then I will leave myself a note and say go back and you know write
10:04
this scene where they're gonna have this difficult conversation so while I'm drafting sometimes I will skip scenes
10:10
and leave myself a little note using those double X's then what I do when I'm going and making this big outline of my
10:17
story I will search for X X and I will go through and I'll either make note of
10:23
the scenes that need to be filled in and need to be written sometimes it's a research thing so sometimes it's like
10:28
okay I don't know how to research like I don't have time right now I don't want to stop my flow of writing to go
10:33
research about Chicago and what would be the best transportation for her to get from here to there so I'll just leave
10:40
myself a note xx research how Frankie would get from her dorm to downtown and I won't actually put it in the story so
10:47
when I go through this first step and I'm making my outline I will usually go
10:53
back and do that research fill in those holes write those scenes if I can or I'll make a note on my outline that I've
11:00
skipped a scene here and that I need to go back and write it so that's step one pretty easy step because I'm just making
Step 2 Analysis
11:07
notes about what I've already written step two is where we start to get into some of the hard stuff so step two is
11:14
where I analyze that outline and I begin to look at story structure and craft and
11:21
I begin to look at the big picture items now again in step two I'm not looking at typos and exact word choice and you know
11:29
the emotion of this exact moment and I'm not getting nitpicky line by line at
11:35
this point I'm still looking at kind of the overarching big-picture things I'm putting the structure of my story
11:41
together so if we were building a house here at this point you know with step one I would have put the foundation in
11:47
and step two now I'm actually building the structure so that it's going to look like a skeleton of a house so I want to
11:55
make sure that all those little joints and logs and everything you know whatever it is is there so I'm looking
12:00
at story structure I'm saying do I have a strong enough act1 climax is there a strong enough hook at the beginning and
12:06
I actually have a huge list of questions that I asked myself to help guide to
12:12
these edits now that entire list that I typically ask myself is inside this editing guide but I'm gonna go over just
12:18
a few of them with you here so you get an idea of what kind of questions I ask does the opening of this story have a
12:24
good enough hook will it intrigue readers enough to make them keep turning the pages so I question that I read back
12:30
through it and I say is this a good enough hook is it gonna grab people right away or do I need to start a little bit later in the story then I'll
12:37
ask myself do all the plot points exist in the story as it is right now if not what's missing and if yes are they
12:44
strong enough so by plot points I'm talking about you know those things I was saying are in my
12:49
plotting series so do I have an argument against transformation do I have an inciting event and a key
12:54
event what happens at the act1 climax what is their reaction to that act one climax
13:00
do I have tests and challenges throughout act - what's the Act - midpoint and is that a strong enough
13:06
like turns the story on its head moment do I have all of those elements of a good story - is the black moment really
13:13
black does it feel like a dark night of the soul like all is lost or do I need to do something to make that stronger so
13:19
I'm going to exam every part of the story structure another question is what is the central
13:25
conflict in this story is it sufficient to make readers care about what happens so is it cohesive is it focused on a
13:32
central main conflict does that conflict get resolved by the end so I've got a
13:38
whole list of questions that I begin to ask myself and this is kind of the tedious part of rebuilding so it's
13:45
almost like redrafting during step two of my editing and revision process I am
13:51
rewriting usually massive swathes of the first act and then I usually don't have
13:56
to rewrite as much until I get to the end but I am at this point
14:01
rewriting reforming making sure that the story structure is in place that it's
14:07
good enough that the pacing is good that the conflict is good I'm looking at characterization and I'm saying like do
14:13
I like these characters do their motivations make sense do they act according to their age and according to
14:19
genre expectations so I'm asking all of these questions and this for me is
14:24
usually the longest part of my editing process this can take me weeks of rewriting and refocusing and re
14:31
centering and I don't like I said worry about the grammar an exact sentence
14:37
choice if I see something that I just know right away needs to be changed of course I'll change it but I'm not going
14:43
through the story line by line I'm looking at the big picture items like the pacing and the flow of the story and
14:49
the story structure and the characters and whether it all fits together as a cohesive story then when I feel like all
14:57
those building blocks are in place and the story itself is strong enough to
15:03
support you know the house that's being built here then I'll move on to step three step three for me is my line edit
Step 3 Line Edit
15:10
so what I mean by line edit is this is where I actually go through the story line by line
15:17
now I'm getting picky I'm getting picky about my word choices I'm getting picky about is there enough emotion is this
15:23
the right dialogue tag I'm looking specifically for repeated words I'm looking for things like show don't tell
15:31
which as writers we've all heard of this beef or right that you know instead of telling people a conversation occurred
15:37
we should actually show the conversation instead of telling people about you know
15:42
the fact that you arrived at this cabin we should actually see our character arrive at the cabin so I'm asking myself
15:48
like am i showing as much as possible of course there are times when you need to just tell and get it and move on
15:54
but you'll begin to learn that sort of stuff by instinct and you'll begin to trust your instincts but I'm looking for
16:00
show don't tell I'm looking for typos at this point I'm looking for errors but I'm also looking for repeated words you
16:07
know so if I said oh she arrived at the cabin and then she went into the cabin okay well now I've used a word cabin
16:12
twice in one sentence or four times in one paragraph because when we're drafting we don't always hear the cadence and flow of the words so I'm
16:19
looking for those repeated words I'm looking at every single line one word at a time and making sure that every single
16:26
choice is the most concise clear most efficient way and the most powerful way
16:33
I can say what I'm trying to say at this point hopefully I'm not actually changing the story because I did that in
16:39
step 2 but sometimes here I also begin when I'm looking at exact word choice
16:44
and character emotion I may realize that you know what this character's motivation is not as strong as it needs
16:49
to be so for the most part in step 3 I'm doing this line by line edit sometimes
16:55
they're still going to come some rewrites that happen with this because I'll realize something isn't strong enough or it's not coming together so in
17:02
the handout that I have for you guys I do have a list of things like here are the main things I look at during this
Step 4 Word Choice
17:08
stage of the revision process word choice it's best to simplify as much as possible at this stage you want your
17:14
words to be as efficient and clear as possible and of course this is going to depend on your genre if you're writing a
17:20
story set in Victorian England that's like a historical fiction you're gonna have a totally different like tone and
17:26
aesthetic then you would if you're writing a teen horror set in today's day so it's you want it to be true to your
17:33
genre and you want to be looking at tone and word choice there but for the most part you do want to have clear concise
17:39
wording I'm looking for repetition I'm looking for sentence flow does the
17:44
sentence flow or am i stumbling over words that seemed awkward are there awkward choices unnecessary extra words this is
17:52
a big one so as you begin to look through your rough draft you're going to notice that you have certain crunch words that you use over and over again
17:58
like that or just or really so you use these words over and over and what I
Step 5 Overuse
18:05
have for you inside this handout is I have a list of arts here like a little
18:12
actually all of the almost basically began begin breath breathed
18:17
completely definitely down even just a whole bunch of these words like really
18:22
just totally that that we tend to use as crutch words and as you go you may
18:28
discover that you have crutch words that aren't on this list I would highly encourage you to write down your words
18:33
that you overuse like maybe you use the phrase like or maybe you use eventually
18:39
or maybe you use phrases about how someone looks too many times like maybe
18:46
your character is biting their lip every other word or maybe your character is constantly winking at people or they
18:52
have certain twitches it's fine to use those a few times to establish that this character has their own quirks but you
18:58
don't want that character every time we see them and every time she speaks to be biting her lip so find your little
19:04
crutches that you use and you overuse and make a list of those in addition to
19:10
the words that I've included here now that doesn't mean you have to take out every single instance of the word literally but you don't want to
19:18
literally use the word literally five thousand times in your novel so just make sure that you're not using it too
19:25
much or overusing it and you'll start to understand when you go through this line by line and you can even do search and
19:31
replace with these so I tend to use the word that and just so many times so I
19:38
will actually do an entire round of drafts round of edits where I will just
19:43
search for some of these what I call my crutch words and I'll just analyze each sentence every single time a new search
19:49
pops up and I'll say does it belong there or can I strengthen this a little bit that's going to make your writing so
19:55
much stronger if you take out those unnecessary words powerful words have you used the most powerful
20:00
words to get your point across or have you relied too much on a lot of adjectives to describe everything so
20:06
like instead of saying Harper was really mad you might say fury boiled inside her
20:13
you would come up with just a little bit of a stronger or more powerful way to
20:18
say it now sometimes you can overdo that that it's like every sentence is almost like hyperbole you don't want that you
20:25
don't want it to be like over fury raged within her she was a you know bubbling pile of ashes you know whatever it is
20:32
that doesn't make any sense but whatever you don't want it to become over or
20:38
melodramatic but when you do have these moments make them as strong as you can so this is where you're looking for that
20:44
you're looking for typos did you spell things correctly do you have commas in the right place do you capitalize things
20:50
consistently in other possible errors so the show don't tell all so you're
20:55
looking for head hopping here so you if you're in one character's point of view
21:01
that character can't know what's going on in somebody else's head so I can't be like if I'm Harper and I'm in her point
21:08
of view I can't say I walked into the room and such and such and such and such and then in the next sentence say
21:13
Jackson thought something something because I can't know what he's thinking because I'm not in his point of view so
21:19
that's kind of head hopping is where you're hearing multiple characters point of view now if you're an omniscient POV
21:25
you're gonna have a different way of writing that where you have a narrator who knows what everyone is thinking but
21:31
you there's also ways and rules of how to handle that so you want to look at a POV and make sure you're handling it in
21:37
the correct way you also want to look at tense in this section where you're making sure that if you're in past tense
21:43
first-person past tense that you stay in first-person past tense and you don't go into present tense or switch it around
21:50
just to give you a little personal story my saturdayman saga which started out as
21:56
the peaceful high demons series started in first-person past tense so I walked
22:01
into the room etc etc when I switched to writing my Fairhope series in 2013 I
22:07
decided to write it in first-person present tense I walk into the room and I
22:13
see so it's happening as the story unfolds and I struggled so much with that change
22:19
then when I decided to move on to my zombie series I wrote that in third person past tense so I actually have
22:25
three series in three different tenses and POV styles and you know sometimes it
22:30
just takes a little while to get into that so if you've been writing first-person present tense and then now
22:36
this new draft you've been working on his first-person past tense you may find that in the first act or so you've
22:42
really slipped into the old tense that you were working with so you want to make sure that you've got that
22:47
consistent throughout the entire draft so make sure that you've really learned those rules and you're looking for those
22:54
sort of things when it comes to step three and you're doing the line edits you might find it useful for yourself
22:59
and for your own process to take these one at a time so you make a one entire pass where you're just specifically
23:05
looking at tense and head hopping and making sure the POV is good and you're just focused in on that then when you
23:11
finish that pass of your draft you might look at it from line one again and be
23:17
checking for those adjectives and those repeated words and things like that so you might find it better to do very
23:22
focused editing passes where you're just looking at one specific thing or you
23:28
might find it more efficient for yourself to just be looking at all of these things and go through it two or
23:34
three times with these things in mind it's going to be up to you how you want to work your process one thing I do
23:40
recommend is that when you get to the stage where you're in step 3 try revising it and reading through it
23:46
once on your computer where it's a digital format and then print it out and try doing it as well on paper because
23:54
your mind and your brain is going to catch different types of typos and words and things like that when you're
24:00
actually editing it on paper and I know it sucks to like use so much ink and use so much paper but you can recycle it and
24:07
it'll be fine but if you don't want to print it out and you don't want to use up the paper or you know hurt the
24:13
environment in that way then maybe try one time on your desktop one time on your laptop or one time on your desktop
24:19
one time on your iPad so that you're kind of getting different screens and different
24:24
so maybe you're sitting in your chair for one round of edits maybe you're lying on the couch and you're doing it
24:30
on a laptop for your second round of edits just getting out of that environment when you're doing a second
24:36
pass can really help you discover new things I find that a lot of people will take their rough rough draft print that
24:43
out and they'll make tons and tons of notes on it personally for me I decided not to print it out at that stage like
24:51
when it's first done with a rough draft and printing it out because when I see an error at that point I just want to go
24:56
ahead and change it I don't want to have to make a bunch of handwritten notes and then go in and transfer that to my
25:02
computer it was a waste of time for me and as an indie author like I said we're always thinking about speed and doing
25:07
things as efficiently as possible so I don't print it out until I get to step three and this is maybe my third pass of
25:15
step three where I'm really looking for those typos I'm really like looking for those word choices and things that I
25:20
might have missed like repeated words then I print it out but for me printing it out in the beginning is kind of a
25:27
waste of time because when I see those changes I don't want to have to double do it I don't want to have to write it out and input it into the computer I
25:34
just want to input it when I'm ready to go I'll talk more about that process in the final video where I show how I
25:40
organize my edits and how I go from one draft in Google Docs to another but that's for another day so when all of
Step 4 Listen
25:48
that stuff is done and I've got the best word choices I've gone line by line you
25:53
know the story is set and I've gone line by line and I've looked at every single word I move on to step four step four is
26:00
something that I did not start doing until I was a good probably seven or eight novels into my career and someone
26:06
I don't even remember who suggested this to me and it was life-changing because I
26:11
don't know about you but no matter how many times I go through my manuscript with a fine-tooth comb and look at every
26:17
single word there's always still arish there's still little typos there's still little things that I missed so step four
26:25
I will take my entire novel which at this point should be pretty polished and I will put it into a text-to-speech
26:32
program so that it will read it to me sometimes if I don't have the
26:37
opportunity to put it on to a computer or I just want to read it to myself I will read it out loud but the point here is to actually
26:44
listen to your story so far most of your revisions have been done by silently
26:50
reading your manuscript whether on your computer or on paper but you've been just hearing it in your head and when we
26:56
do that we tend to skip words we tend to miss words we tend to not hear some of the repetition or the awkwardness of how
27:04
some sentences might flow but when you begin to read it out loud boy are you really going to catch the
27:11
error so you're gonna see where this doesn't make sense I missed a word here because when you're physically listening
27:17
to it or reading it out loud you're going to hear those missed words and you're going to hear those repetitions
27:22
and you're going to hear the awkward things that you sort of stumble over every single time or that it seemed
27:27
confusing it doesn't matter whether you read it out loud you have your partner read it out loud to you or you can use a
Natural Reader
27:34
program online one that I like to use is called natural reader it's actually natural readers calm and they have a
27:40
couple different voices that you can choose from or you can pay for premium voices and you can basically just upload
27:46
your entire manuscript into natural reader and it will read it out loud to you and you can even speed it up like
27:51
one and a half times so it goes a little faster so my preferred way to do it is to upload it to natural reader and then
27:58
have my hard copy that I had printed out before and follow along with it and I'll
28:03
be making notes as I go of like oh that was an error oh that didn't work out right that didn't sound right and
28:09
sometimes if I have entire passages that just seem kind of confusing or awkward when the reader is reading it to me I'll
28:16
go back and read it out loud as well and I'll make changes at that point as well but step four for me is one if you
28:22
haven't tried this with your draft before please go and try it because you will catch so many errors and you will
28:28
start to see things in a new way when you're actually listening to your story now again I don't recommend doing this
28:33
towards the beginning of the process because the story is still clunky anyway do this after you've done your own line
28:39
edits it'll change your life so step five is the easiest step but you would be just appalled by how many
28:47
people skip this step I hear from my editors all the time that some people
28:52
just don't bother running their book through simple spell and grammar check
28:57
guys is 2019 there is so much technology
Spellcheck
29:03
out there there's no excuse for not running your program through a simple spellcheck now I will say this I have
29:10
talked on this channel before about how much I love Google Docs I love it I love writing in it it's my favorite program
29:15
to use but Google Docs does not have a good built-in spellcheck it doesn't always
29:23
catch spelling errors it definitely doesn't catch grammar errors and it doesn't catch missing words it's just
29:30
not a great tool there may be some add-ons so if you know of some Chrome add-ons that are good for Google Docs go
29:36
ahead and link those down below that are like grammar spell checkers I haven't really looked into it but what I do is
29:42
when I'm finished with my entire manuscript I've gone through all four of the first steps I will download my
29:48
Google Doc into a word doc and I will put it into Word Microsoft Word
29:54
Microsoft Word has a pretty good spelling and grammar checker it's not
29:59
flawless it's not perfect but it will catch double words missed words misspelled words sometimes
30:05
inconsistencies that oh you spelled this with a capital letter before and now you're spelling it with a lowercase letter so it's going to catch a lot of
30:12
that stuff it also catches comma errors and things like that like oh you've got two independent clauses here probably
30:18
should put a comma in between them so it will catch some of those errors now I will give you a little bit of a warning
30:24
here that no matter what you use whether it's grammarly or word or if Scrivener has built-in stuff to it that's really
30:30
nice no matter what you're using it is still a computer program it's not a person so it's not going to properly
30:36
analyze your voice your tone like I write in a lot of sentence fragments because I'm writing teen voice and it's
30:43
in her head and so a lot of times I'm writing you know fragments of sentences
30:48
for pacing and for emphasis sometimes word does not like this that's okay I'm
Grammar Check
30:55
the one who's making the ultimate decision because I am in control of my computer program so don't ever blindly
31:01
just run your novel through one of these grammar checkers and just blindly accept Changez because you're gonna end up with
31:07
a huge mess you want to go through every single thing just let it bring it up so
31:13
it'll you'll run spellcheck or grammar check and it'll bring up every single instance of a change and you just
31:18
examine them or analyze them one at a time think through it does this need a comment does it not you may want to
31:25
brush up on your Commons and your grammar rules so that you know whether it belongs there or not but accept or
31:31
decline as you go add things to your dictionary especially if you're writing fantasy and you use words that are
31:37
strange go ahead and add them to your dictionary so it doesn't pull that up every single time but please run your
31:42
novel through some kind of spelling and grammar check there are free tools online if you don't want to pay forward
31:48
but if you have word or if you don't mind paying that whatever it is four dollars a month to get access to the
31:55
Microsoft suite of tools I highly recommend word because it has done a great job I think with spelling and
32:01
grammar check alright step 6 you are so close now if you've made it
Mindset Shift
32:07
to step 6 you've probably been doing weeks if not months of work on editing your novel and you are so close it
32:14
should be super polished super professional at this point you're almost done but you don't want to skip this
32:20
step step 6 is I want you to go through a little bit of a mindset shift the
32:28
entire time you've been working on your novel you've been looking at it from the point of view of an author I am the
32:34
author I am the creator I know all the backstory I know how this world works I know the twists and turns and how this
32:40
you know you've been working on this story possibly for months right if not years some of us you know the ins and
32:46
outs of this and you've been looking at it from the creators perspective but with step six I want you to switch your
32:52
brain and start looking at your work as a reader hopefully whatever genre you
32:58
are writing in is something you've also read extensively in so you understand what the reader expectations are if it's
33:04
a mystery you know that readers expect to know who done it by the end of the book that they expect to have you know
33:11
especially if it's police procedural we expect a body on the page if not in the very first chapter within the first few
33:16
scenes and then we should have another body by Act one and then you know that by the end of this book we should have some
33:23
kind of dangerous you know montage where all seems lost and then we need to know who done it at
33:29
the end of that mystery there are certain types of reader expectations that go along with every single genre now that doesn't mean you need to copy
33:35
someone else's story or be you know cardboard cutout of someone else's story
33:41
but you do need to understand that there are reader expectations that some readers seek out this type of story for
33:47
specific types of feelings and things that they expect so what you want to do for sure in this stage is read it like a
33:56
reader not like an author and try to think to yourself if I didn't know these characters backstories if I didn't know
34:02
this heroine would I fall in love with her right from the first page or would she annoy me do her actions make sense
34:08
does it make sense that she's doing all these things sure it might make sense that she goes and does this crazy stupid
34:15
thing because you know what she's been through in the past and you knows that she's just scared and she's reacting but
34:22
if you haven't given your reader that background of your character and told them what she's been through or given
34:27
them hints as to why she's reacting this way and really grounded her in some kind of motivation that makes that action
34:34
seem necessary or plausible they're not going to love your heroine so you have to be able to switch your mind from
34:42
author to reader mode and think is this a good hook do I have all the reader
34:47
expectations for my genre is the story fast-paced or is anything boring enough that even though I wrote it I kind of
34:53
want to start flipping pages is it too much action do I feel like I can't take a breath do I need to slow down and pace
35:00
it a little bit slower here after this big action scene if this is supposed to be a romance do they end up together at
35:06
the end if this is a romance do the characters meet within the first couple of chapters or does it take till the
35:12
second act for them to me because there are certain rules of each genre that you need to at least keep in mind and if
35:17
you're breaking them you need to be breaking them intentionally not just because you didn't know better so this
35:24
is where you really look at it from a readers point of view now some of this stuff you are going to want to ask yourself like is there a good hook and
35:30
that sort of thing we asked ourselves that and step one but now we're revisiting it now that the story is really well polished we're
35:37
revisiting it and we're looking at it again from the point of view of a reader and once you feel like you've really got
35:43
everything that needs to be in place and you've got a really good novel then you can move on to step seven which is
35:49
finally sending it out to your beta readers your critique group or a professional editor now if you're
35:55
traditionally publishing and you've had an editor waiting for it or an agent waiting for it so she can shop it this
36:01
is the point where you're going to send it off to that agent or that editor and you're gonna start to get feedback from them and they will let you know kind of
36:08
what their process is and at what stage of this process because an agent may want your book you know on stage to to
36:15
go ahead and start giving you feedback on how to fix your story but for those of you that are indie like me this is
36:22
where you send it off to your professional editor or to your beta readers I personally send it out to my
36:27
beta readers first and we're going to talk about that in another video coming up so I'll talk about beta readers and
36:33
what kinds of questions to ask them even in this guide I have sample questions for your beta readers and stuff like that so you definitely want to download
36:39
that but also look out for that video coming soon I'm also going to talk to you about what types of professional
36:45
edits are out there and available to you and how much those are gonna cost you on average we have a lot more to talk about
36:52
but hopefully this video on how to self edit your novel has given you a really good place to start and truthfully this
36:58
is one of the most important parts and I realized when I was putting together this guide that really I probably could
37:04
have done a video exclusively on each of these steps so if you find that you didn't get enough information and you
37:10
really need more guidance on like step 1 and step 2 which are kind of the biggest steps of the whole process then go ahead
37:16
and comment down below and let me know yes I want videos where you expand on this I won't be able to do it yet this summer and as most of you know I do have
37:23
a baby on the way but I could plan a more extensive editing series in the fall for you guys so you got to let me
37:29
know that you would want that because I started realizing gosh there's so much that goes into editing and there's a lot
37:35
more that I could say but hopefully this gives you guys a good place to start please don't forget to subscribe to this
37:41
channel so that you'll get notified whenever new videos come up in this series so go ahead and head over to my website
37:48
at heart breathing's calm slash blog or heart breathing's calm slash how to edit
37:53
your novel and download this free guide or if you're already on my email list you can go to your email and search for
38:00
it so hopefully this guide is going to help to literally guide you through your process as you edit your novel in the
38:07
comments down below let me know what you thought of this first video where you struggled what editing tips you might
38:13
have for their community or other people that are reading and whether or not you have actually finished a drafter in the
38:19
editing stage yourself I would love to hear about your progress thank you guys so much for sticking around for this
38:25
longer video I hope that it's been helpful for you make sure you subscribe and like this video and I will see you
38:31
guys in my next one so on Sunday I'm gonna have a planner video that is not about these edits but we're gonna have the next two videos in
38:37
this editing series will go live next week so make sure you stay tuned alright guys I will see you in the next one bye
38:43
for now

yay you finish a rough draft of a novel and now it's time to edit it which is
0:07
where so many people get stuck where do I start how do I actually turn this into
0:12
a publishable novel if you've been stuck here or you're just looking forward to watching someone else's process I have a
0:19
great video today where we're going to talk about how to edit your rough draft so let's get started
0:25
[Music] many of you know that I have literally
0:32
just recently completed the rough draft of my 28th novel which is a why a
0:37
supernatural Thriller called The Disappearance of Vanessa Shaw I am very excited for this book however it is a
0:45
mess and that is where so many people I think get stuck is the rough draft is
0:51
this sort of dream world of anything can happen I can always fix it later well
0:57
when you get into edits and your draft is finished it's later and it's time to take whatever jumbled up mess was on
1:04
that page and turn it into something that feels readable that feels good that you'd be excited to pass off to someone
1:10
else and have them read it and understand it and feel the way you wanted them to feel and get all the twists and turns and that's where we get
1:18
into the nitty-gritty of the structure the theme the dialogue the backstory all
1:24
of it needs to come together and sometimes that can feel so incredibly overwhelming because there's all of
1:30
these layers and we feel like they need to be perfect so first things first if
1:35
you have been stuck in this place of I feel overwhelmed I don't know where to start remind yourself on a daily basis
1:42
that you don't have to fix everything all at once it's truly about tiny little
1:48
baby steps let me use a little analogy for you if you've ever seen someone
Editing Your Draft
1:54
carve an ice sculpture or at least familiar with that process it starts out as a completely shapeless you know just
2:01
plain block of ice and there's a vision that the sculptor has for how they want
2:08
it to be but really it's just these little micro tweaks they can't snap their fingers or carve into it once and
2:15
it's ta-da it's a unicorn or something like that it takes a process of
2:21
carving the outside seeing the next layer imagining where this needs to go and then eventually getting down to the
2:28
little details but that person who's carving the sculpture doesn't think about those nitty-gritty details right
2:34
from the beginning they're just trying to get the basic shape and that's really what we've done with story we've taken
2:40
this idea and when your rough draft is completed you're at some stage of trying
2:47
to make this shapeless block into the shape that you want it to be and the
2:52
vision that you had for this novel and how much time it's going to need how many passes how much detail you're gonna
2:59
have to take how many how much feedback you know all of that stuff is gonna kind of depend on how close your book is to
3:07
its final shape when the rough draft is over and that can vary by author to
3:12
author but it can also vary from book to book I have had books where really by the time I was finished it really looked
3:20
already like I wanted it to look you know it had already taken shape and now I'm just into these little details of
3:25
carving things out and you know putting on the final touches then I have other books like this one
3:31
disappearance of Vanessa Shaw where it's like if that's supposed to be a unicorn we are not there yet and it's going to
3:38
need a lot more work so part of the editing process is just identifying how
3:44
much work your book is going to need and I'm going to walk you through some of that stage and I'm also just gonna throw
3:49
out here from the beginning that because there's no way to say everyone's book at
3:55
the end of a rough draft looks exactly like this and has this level of detail there's no way to give you a
4:01
prescriptive like do this step first do this step second and this is going to lead you to your book because some of
4:07
these steps that I'm going to talk about today might not be necessary for you because you already took those steps
4:13
like making sure every scene leads to the next outcome or making sure your story question or your character Arc is
4:19
done all that might already be done because you did it in pre-work or you wrote it into the rough draft the more
4:25
experienced you are as a writer you know all of these things are going to come into play so it's really impossible to say this is
4:33
exactly where everyone needs to start so that's not what I'm going to do today instead I'm just going to walk you
4:38
through the steps that I follow in hopes that somewhere along the way you will feel inspired for where you can start to
4:45
pick your own story up but one of the things that I love to do is to start with more of an eagle eye view of my
4:52
story just like if I was looking at this glass or ice sculpture that was just
4:58
barely taking shape I would kind of back up from it and I would imagine what is the shape I want this thing to take and
5:05
then gradually get more and more into the details so it's sort of like you're
5:11
high up and you're zooming down imagine a drone you know you're up in the sky and you're zooming into the story and
5:17
you take it one layer at a time and that's the way I like to view my edits another thing that is worth noting is
Trusting Yourself
5:24
as writers part of our job is to open our minds to listening to what other
5:31
people's process is and to learn from other people and their experience but
5:37
another part of our job is to listen to our own intuition and to our own process
5:43
which is going to be informed by our own strengths our personality our experience our knowledge all of these different
5:49
things and so always keep your mind open to what you
5:54
might be able to glean from someone else's advice while still trusting yourself and your own intuition because
6:01
there can be a million videos out here or books on how to edit but your editing
6:06
process might look very different from something you've ever seen someone else do and a lot of times I think we can
6:12
hold ourselves back from following our own process or the thing that's right for us because we keep trying to match
6:19
someone else's process oh this person on YouTube told me these 10 steps and you keep trying it and it's just like you're
6:24
beating your head against it right sometimes we have to say this isn't working for me how can I adapt and
6:30
change this to become my own process so if as you're thinking through these things something else comes to mind that
6:37
you're like oh I don't want to do it Sarah's way but maybe I could try it tweaked this way please do so because
6:43
there is nobody who is a teacher of writing who can tell you this is exactly the way you need to do it every writer
6:49
learns from other people and then uses their own intuition because you are an
6:55
innate Storyteller an intuitive Storyteller to some degree you've been consuming story your entire life you
7:01
know how to do this it's just a matter of figuring out a process that works for you and the way that you work in order
7:09
to uncover that you know beautiful shape that's underneath this block of ice so
7:14
enough with the analogy but let's dive into how I choose to edit my book
7:19
we are taking a little bit of a break here from the Vlogs but if you want to see this process in action make sure
7:26
that you're subscribed to this Channel and come back to watch next week as I dive into the actual like Vlog style
7:33
behind the scenes of how I'm actually editing this novel and you'll be able to see it a little bit more also if you
7:40
want to go a bit deeper on some of these subjects I do have more videos on this channel about how to write great scenes
7:46
how to write note cards or how to plot from scenes how to go from idea to a full novel I have lots of stuff like
7:52
that including how to plot your novel and an entire series on editing and most of those come with free workbooks so I'm
7:57
going to link all that for you below but I'd also love your feedback in the comments I've had many requests to do an
8:05
updated full series of how to plot your novel with all the things I'm currently
8:10
using in my own process so if you would like to see an updated version of that with an updated workbook please hit like
8:16
on this video and comment down below and let me know alright let's Dive In into my multi-step editing process
Post-Draft Braindump
8:23
first step for me almost always without fail is to do a post draft brain dump so
8:31
I find that just writing the end of a book that final scene the resolution something like that will often bring a
8:38
certain type of clarity of how like who this character needs to be when they hit that final scene how this comes together
8:45
how the villain is defeated you know something like that so I feel like those thoughts are as fresh as they're ever
8:51
going to be right when I finish the novel so this past time I finished the book the next day I sat down for about
8:58
an hour and just created a list of bullet points of anything that was still in my head about the story I just sort
9:04
of Flushed it out through my fingers and said you know this is who she needs to be this twist might be possible I think
9:10
I need to strengthen this any thoughts that come to your mind just go ahead and do some kind of brain dump if you
9:17
finished your book a long time ago and it's not fresh like that it can be helpful to go back and reread your story
9:23
just to get familiar with it again and then kind of have a post read wrap up of
9:29
your thoughts of the book what needs to be fixed that can help you just clarify things a little bit it doesn't have to
9:34
be just pages and pages long but just to capture those thoughts so you don't lose them post draft brain dough
Big Picture
9:41
the next thing I usually like to do is to go over the big picture of this book
9:47
so if it is part of a series then I will kind of reread the end of the previous
9:54
book so right now this book is a standalone but if I am going back to write Book 12 of My Shadow Demon Saga I
10:01
would take a little bit of time to reread maybe the last five or six chapters or the climax and resolution of
10:07
book 11 to make sure that as I'm looking at Book 12 in edits I know exactly where
10:14
the reader is coming from and that I'm starting off in the best place so that's one thing that I'll do then I'll also
10:19
get that eagle eye view what's the story question or dramatic question of this particular book now this book is a
10:26
standalone that I'm working on now so my story question is pretty easy what happened to Vanessa Shaw it's
10:32
called The Disappearance of Vanessa Shaw it is a standalone basically murder mystery what happened to Vanessa Shaw
10:39
and that is the question that every scene in this book is trying to answer
10:44
and so if you can identify that what's the story question here what's the main question the dramatic question that's
10:50
going to be answered by the end of this book that's going to help to guide every single scene as we'll get into in a
10:55
minute sometimes I will also take a moment here to identify the theme of my book is it about trust is it about found
11:02
family is it about you know whatever it may be theme wise sometimes I still don't fully know a theme and I'll add
11:09
that in later but you can sort of decide if you want to tackle that right now I also here will take a very close look
11:18
at my character arcs so some of my books have multiple main characters so my
11:24
Shadow Demon Saga has really four lead characters and they each have their own character Arc some of them span multiple
11:31
books so that gets a little more complex but with this particular book I do have eight points of view but really there's
11:38
only one point of view that's my main character Lorelei who gets a full character Arc so I'm gonna zero in on
11:45
her before I even start edits or rereads or anything else and I'm gonna think what is lorelei's character Arc and the
11:53
way I do that is I first start about thinking where is she emotionally at the
11:58
beginning of this book and where is she by the end and I did this work when I
12:03
first started plotting this book but now I have more clarity on who she is and what she's going to go through and who
12:09
she's going to become by that final scene because I've now written it so it gives me that clear that I can really
12:15
hone in on exactly what her journey is and for me there's three parts of it and
12:20
this became clear after reading James Scott's Bell start your story from the middle or his book superstructure where
12:27
he talks about a character's mirror moment another really great book on character Arc is K.M wyland's creating character
12:34
arcs both of these I highly highly recommend and they were transformative for me in terms of coming up with this
12:40
character Arc uh framework so as of James Scott Bell I will look at where's
12:46
my character at the beginning of the novel where are they at the midpoint of the novel when they go through something
12:52
that he calls a mirror moment where they really realize I've been resisting transformation I've
12:59
been resisting change but they start to understand that if I don't change I will die and that can be a literal or
13:05
figurative death and then the second half of the novel is their actual embracing that change until the climax
13:11
where they fully step into that change or that transformation so I like to at
13:16
least know those three points of my character beginning the middle and the end what's their emotional Arc because
13:22
everything that character is going through is going to inform the plot and the emotion of my book and I want to
13:28
make sure that I've zeroed in on it before I start my edits I'm going to show you sort of what this process looks
Identify Turning Points
13:34
like a little bit and then I'll get into this in more detail in next week's Vlog I used to always look at story grid like
13:41
this where this column is act one act two part one part two and act three and
13:47
I know these are not measured obviously this one's tiny and this one's huge but I have found lately that I like viewing
13:53
the story from left to right like this so this would be act 1 here and then two
13:59
first half to the second half and then act three down here and this is working
14:04
better for my brain but it doesn't really matter which way you do it or you could actually just write these down on
14:12
a piece of paper without putting them on a story grid but I like to look at the major events and turning points of my
14:19
story and like I said even if I have done this at the beginning of writing or somewhere through the writing process I
14:25
like to do it again in edits if you are someone who pantses your way through and you don't plot at all this can also be
14:31
helpful even if you already know these places like what happens in these scenes from when you were pantsing it it can be
14:37
helpful just to see it visually if you're that type of learner so one of the first things for me is the opening
14:44
scene or the hook so that's going to happen right here at the beginning of the book so this is the hook in this
14:50
book it's that Vanessa disappears no one ever sees her again then I also am going to look at the end
14:57
of each act so this end of the ACT is really sometimes What's called the key
15:02
event and really the hook in my story of Vanessa's disappearance is really my inciting event in some books the
15:10
inciting incident doesn't happen until somewhere later in the story sometimes it happens before your Story begins in
15:16
mine it's kind of this prologue is the inciting event and then the hook as well and then the key event according to km
15:24
Weiland and the way she explains it which made so much sense to me in her book structuring your novel is this is this
15:32
event that locks your character into the story so they might be resisting you know art transformation they might have
15:39
been able to leave this world at any moment but this is really the you know the moment that's known as the first
15:45
doorway is no return the Act One climax or the key event which happens at the
15:50
same time as the first doorway so I could call this the first door away and what I would do is instead of actually
15:57
writing hook or inciting incident or first doorways I would write what those moments are so we'll talk about that in
16:03
terms of my book next week but for yourself and your own plotting sometimes
16:09
this can be what makes or breaks your decision of where you start with your
16:14
edits so it can feel difficult to come back through and just get this structure
16:20
figured out but it can also be incredibly helpful to lay out the structure get the eagle eye view of like
16:26
what are the turning points in my story where the story really switches up and then I'll show you what to do in The
16:32
Next Step so I like to identify the hook or inciting incident the first doorway at a minimum sometimes
16:39
in here I will also identify the moment where we meet the antagonist or the
16:44
mystery just something like that if you're too if it's a romance and the two characters are meeting for the first
16:50
time you could put that in here but just any other major event not the little details but the big events of the story
16:56
that kind of turn things on its head in act two we kind of have like scenes here
17:01
that are into the new world so the new like if they've passed through a doorway
17:06
here what's their reaction to it what's happening in act two at the beginning
17:12
I'm usually going to identify that and then somewhere along the way here there's going to be what's called a
17:17
pinch point and that is going to be some kind of bigger moment of conflict or uh like
17:24
mine is a mystery so this is going to be a new clue that comes to light something that has you questioning what really
17:30
happened to Vanessa so that's going to be a pinch point where we start to believe that the antagonist might be in
17:36
the house with them like the killer or whatever so that's going to be the pinch point I'll start identifying that and
17:42
then we're also going to identify here what's the midpoint sometimes when I go through this all I
17:49
know is the hook the key event or first doorway the midpoint and the climax and
17:54
that's all I need to identify but the more detailed you can get on the bigger ones the better off sometimes it can be
17:59
so then we also will have you know a second pinch Point somewhere along here
18:07
into the second half of the act and you could put this is some kind of reaction to the midpoint second pimp pinch point
18:15
and then somewhere around here we're going to have the second doorway which is going to be another big reveal or
18:21
twist or something that happens that catapults are characters into the Final Act and the final sort of climax of The
18:29
Story So somewhere here in the third act usually pretty early on we're going to have the All Is Lost moment
18:35
there will be lots of things they'll be making their final plans they'll be trying to figure out the final Clues you
18:41
know all that stuff but they'll be at some point it could be here it could be way back here All Is Lost the black
18:46
Moment The Dark Night of the Soul it's been called many things but that sort of black moment is important to know and
18:52
then what's the climactic moment or the climax of the story what's the final battle that they have to fight and of
18:58
course in a romance it's going to be the profession of Love or you might use different beats if you have Gwen Hayes's
19:05
Romancing the beat you might be using different beats here if you use something like save the cat you might be
19:10
using different terminology here it really doesn't matter what terms you use just figure out what story structure
19:16
speaks best to you and then identify the main turning points which are usually going to be at
19:22
the end of each Act and then what's the resolution so these are really the bones sometimes I call them the tent
19:29
poles these are the main things that your story hangs upon so what I will do first is I will actually either do a
19:36
grid like this or I will just put them on a piece of paper so I have a download
19:42
for you that I created at the beginning of this channel called how to plot your novel and that is a free download and it
19:48
has all of these turning points as well as the character Arc the goal motivation conflict and I use that in the initial
19:54
plotting but I also will sometimes use it and tweak it for this edit as well so
19:59
if you want to download that and use those pages you can they have all these turning points on them as well but I
20:05
will sometimes just create a long sheet here that says like hook Act One Climax
20:10
and I will just write out what happens in the story like Lorelei does XYZ and
20:17
then you know into the new world and I'll literally just make these bullet points or I can put them on a story grid
20:22
and either way it doesn't matter but what this does is it gives me the main over arching structure if you already
20:29
have all your structure and all your scenes figured out you don't need to do this but it might be something that Sparks an idea for you inevitably
20:36
throughout that process of re-outlining looking at the big picture
20:42
moments of my book will start to bring up more Scene ideas because when I first
20:48
worked through this when I didn't have anything written yet it was very Bare Bones but now that I come back to the
20:55
plot after the fact I have an idea of exactly how I'm getting from that opening scene to that midpoint and some
21:01
of it is written but this is where once I have those major sort of tent polls or
21:08
major scenes figured out this is where my next step comes in which is going
21:13
back to the very beginning of the book and taking it scene by scene
Scene By Scene
21:19
the next piece of the puzzle is really filling in all the gaps and if you
21:24
already have a rough draft chances are some of these gaps are already filled in for you like you may already have 10
21:30
scenes between the hook and the key event or the first doorway but if you
21:36
have a lot of plot holes some of the scenes might be missing or the scenes don't quite link together appropriately
21:42
in my case for disappearance of Vanessa Shaw I have a bunch of scenes that I
21:47
don't know where they fit on this story grid in the present timeline and so what I am going to do is I would actually at
21:54
this stage of the process take what I have in my rough draft and I will also take this storyboard or story grid and I
22:02
will start thinking okay first chapter I have this hook an inciting event is that
22:07
something I want to keep yes or no yes look at the second scene does it make
22:13
sense to go from where they were in the inciting incident to this next scene
22:19
yes or no so let's say here we have a prologue and the next is the opening
22:24
scene of Lorelei arriving at the cabin that makes sense it's fine but there
22:31
might be some other things I know I need to change about this scene so I will put it here on this story grid but I also
22:37
will then create a index card where I go a little bit more into detail about what
22:43
I want to happen in this scene now you could write it on an index card or you
22:48
could just have a plotting notebook or another piece of paper that you say here's the notes of what I want to
22:53
change in chapter two it doesn't really matter the mechanism that you use it's just a matter of in this stage of edits
23:00
what we're looking at is we're trying to create a progression of scenes that go
23:08
logically from one to the next whereas if you have a lot of holes or you have a lot of unnecessary scenes sometimes you
23:14
do need to go through this process fill in the blanks fill in the gaps make some adjustments so that you know that number
23:21
one every scene in your book is necessary that it's there for a reason it's moving the plot forward or the
23:26
character Arc word in some way it's reveal feeling a clue it should every scene should be doing multiple things
23:32
that should be advancing your character Arc or revealing some kind of information it should be you know
23:38
advancing the plot your story question you know looking deeper into your theme
23:43
it should have multiple reasons for being in the book and so at this point I
23:49
would say okay I know my hook I know where I'm heading in the first doorway what are the scenes that logically fit
23:55
in between and this is going to be a mixture of brainstorming new things and
24:00
evaluating what I've already written and seeing if it's necessary how does it move the plot forward how does it need
24:07
to shift and this is really some of the hardest work because it's hard to make
24:13
some of these decisions so you just give yourself the time and be patient trying to figure it out if there's a part here
24:20
at the beginning that you just think I just don't know what those scenes are going to be don't be afraid to just skip forward to act two because maybe in your
24:27
draft Act 2 was much better and flowed a lot easier than act one so if you can't
24:33
figure it out just write the scenes that you do know maybe you have a handful of scenes you know and then you could
24:39
use a highlighter here to say I don't know what's happening here and I don't know what's happening here so you know
24:46
you've got some gaps move on to the second act and maybe in the second act you're able to identify every single
24:52
scene and maybe you you threw a few out you added you have a thing here you're going to add this scene and you just go
24:58
through the process of creating a new outline comparing what you have to what
25:04
you want it to be evaluating every single scene for its per purpose its
25:10
theme it's character Arc how does it Advance the plot and either keeping it moving it
25:16
axing it whatever you're gonna do but you make those decisions on this kind of bigger level first and sometimes I will
25:23
also go ahead and redo my plotting cards and what I tend to put on my plotting cards here is an overview of the scene
25:31
the character's goal the conflict that is keeping them from the goal and how
25:36
what's the outcome and sometimes it's this outcome on the note card how does
25:41
this scene end that helps me brainstorm what needs to happen in this unknown scene here because it's like oh she
25:48
hopes that she's pushed them closer together but she doesn't know if she has so what's her next steps what's her next
25:55
question you know so then I can piggyback off of this outcome into what's her next goal or her new plan or
26:02
you know whatever so I will do that all the way through this entire book and
26:08
what this does for me is it helps me to determine what needs work what decisions I need to make and it
26:16
helps me clarify you know the theme the character Arc and all of those types of things at this
26:22
stage of the game I am not looking at my grammar or sentence structure I'm not thinking about the quality of my word
26:28
choices or my prose I am just looking at plot and like I mentioned before some of
26:34
you might not need to do this because your plot is already figured out and your scenes are already in place but for many people this is where you struggle
26:41
is because you're just going from a rough draft to line by line edits rather
26:47
than taking this Eagle eye view of making sure that every scene actually deserves a place in your novel and
26:52
really figuring out the structure but this can be an essential part and I will take you through how I'm actually going
26:58
through this in next week's Vlog now I know that these are a lot of steps which
27:04
is why I said in the beginning that you don't have to do anyone else's exact
27:09
process now after writing for the past 13 years this is the process that I have
27:15
found works best for me I'm very visual I like to write write things down multiple times it solidifies it I get
27:20
new ideas every time I write it down some people really don't need that you could just go straight to your document
27:27
and start writing in notes start editing things without ever having to put them on scene cards so none of this is
27:33
necessary so please don't get hooked into this idea that I have to do these
27:40
tools or I have to use certain kinds of tools in order to be a real writer it's so much better to just follow your own
27:46
intuition what feels good for you if you are attracted to the idea of putting
27:52
things on the wall or color coding or printing out your document and it feels better for you to just open up your word
27:59
document or your scrivener document and start making changes that is perfect your process whatever
28:06
comes most intuitively to you is the best process however I want to share
28:12
everything that I'm doing not to say do it like me but rather to say maybe some of this will spark something for a few
28:19
people and it will be helpful and if not that's okay take what works for you leave the rest and that hopefully is
28:26
good advice for literally everyone that you hear talking about writing
Fill In Gaps
28:31
so the next step for me is to begin filling in the holes once I have figured
28:37
out what those scenes are though I'm probably going to have some redrafting rewriting to do I will take those scene
28:44
cards and I will write the scenes that needed to be completely Rewritten or
28:49
I'll start filling in the holes of the scenes that never got written in the first place now some people would choose
28:56
to just start back at the beginning and start sort of tweaking and editing and then when they hit a chapter that wasn't
29:01
written they'll start writing it and that is totally a valid process as well I just personally like to go in and fix
29:08
the holes first because I'm not always a linear writer I don't have to work from very beginning to end every time
29:14
sometimes I just go in and start with chapter five and fix that then move to chapter 12 fix that fix the ending
29:21
scenes and then I'll start back at the beginning but I like to have the holes fixed so this is sort of a second draft
29:28
for me is going in and filling in those so this is sort of a second piece of my
29:35
drafting is to rewrite or fill in the gaps of anything that I discovered throughout that outlining process needed
Line By Line
29:43
to be redone okay so once I have the entire draft
29:48
with all the plot holes fixed all the scenes filled in I feel like the
29:53
structure of it is good the scenes are in place the character Arc is in place that's when I'm gonna go in line by line
30:00
from start to finish and start tweaking things to amplify it to make it better
30:05
start looking at sentence structure and all those things so here's something important to note
30:11
some of you will start on this stage because your rough draft was so well done that you don't need to re-plot you
30:19
don't need to fill in holes you don't need to rewrite you just need to start going in line by line and fixing
30:24
sentence structure and grammar and amplifying what's already really good on the page and I have had drafts where I
30:31
start at this stage however many of us are going to be somewhere in between where we still need
30:37
that plot work the structure works so hopefully those early steps will be helpful for you but once you get to this
30:43
point it can be super helpful to just start chapter one line one and truly do
30:50
a line edit where you're evaluating every single sentence sentence by
30:55
sentence paragraph by paragraph and you're looking at things like sentence
31:01
structure grammar spelling but you're also looking at the emotion
31:07
the description your word choices making sure that you don't have repeated words missing words that you're really putting
31:14
the level of emotion on the page that you want that you're really describing things with the best words that you can
31:20
we always hear show don't tell so you're putting that in there in a way that you're using as much active voice
31:26
instead of passive voice and this is where we really get into the quality of your writing not just the quality of the
31:32
story itself now there are multiple ways to do this stage I have friends who do
31:39
it in layers so they will read the whole book front to back and they will just be
31:45
focusing in let's say on sentence structure and flow then when they finish
31:51
it they'll come back and they'll start layering in better dialogue they'll start fixing and focusing in only on the
31:57
dialogue so each editing pass meaning each time they read through it they're focusing on one specific
32:04
aspect of their edits so one will be all about their character's Arc and one will
32:10
be all about the Romantic tension and one pass will be all about dialogue one pass will be all about uh you know
32:16
looking at different rhetorical devices or setting or whatever and it'll be individual times so they might read
32:22
through their book 50 times doing all these layers other people however will just go line by line and fix as many
32:29
things all at once as possible or you may go chapter by chapter which is what I do a lot of times I will open up a new
32:36
document and I will copy just chapter one and paste it over to the new
32:41
document so I only have just that one chapter there and I will edit it potentially multiple times I'll read
32:47
through it four or five times and fix as many things as I can in that chapter until I feel like it's good and then
32:53
when I feel like I'm happy with it and it feels polished then I will go to the original rough draft copy chapter 2
33:00
paste it into my new document and I will slowly rebuild my new DOC document one
33:05
chapter at a time knowing that I have a rough draft document and a separate polished document where each rough
33:11
chapter gets pasted in one at a time once you have finished this section once
33:17
you feel like you've gone through every single line of that book and you've
33:22
gotten it where you want it to be the next stage for me is really a listen through so at this stage I will actually
Listen Through
33:30
have whatever program I'm using read it to me with text to speech or I will
33:36
paste my book into a website called natural reader so it's naturalreaders.com I will link it I
33:42
think it's.com I will link it for you down below but now there's lots of text to speech so you could probably do it in
33:48
your own software or you could have it read aloud to you by any number of things but there's just some kind of
33:54
magic where reading it on the page is different you'll catch different things
33:59
you'll hear different things by having it read to you where you're listening to it if you just don't want to use a text
34:06
to speech because you don't like those sort of robotic AI voices you could also print it out or put it on your iPad or
34:12
your Kindle and you could read it aloud to yourself but there's something different about reading it in your brain
34:18
silently and actually speaking the words aloud because it helps you catch not only consistencies but awkward phrasing
34:25
repeated words missing words different things like that plus you can hear whether you're getting that emotional
34:31
core you intended or not so I highly recommend once your book is polished and you've gone line by line and you're
34:37
happy with it do a listen through of your book next it's off to Beta readers
Beta Readers
34:42
so your beta readers are hopefully people that are your first readers I like to give them a list of things like
34:49
things that I want them to look for like tell me when you figured out the mystery
34:55
let me know if you understood everything if there was anything that was confusing blah blah blah blah and I will give them
35:00
a list of things to look for now I have four beta readers and we're not going to go deep into how to find beta readers or
35:05
anything like that in this video but I did give some advice on that earlier on this channel so I will link that beta
35:11
reader video for you below but if you want some updated refreshed videos on
35:16
plot edits beta readers Arc readers all of that please let me know in the comments and make sure you're subscribed
35:23
when I get my edits back from betas I will either take it or leave it so I
35:30
will see their advice I have them work in the same document so they can see each other's comments and that way I can
35:36
see if they argue about something like I think Jackson's being too whiny here no I think it it's beautiful it made me cry
35:41
then I can read their interactions and decide for myself I believe Stephen King
35:46
said something in his book on writing about how if all of his betas agree that something needs to change then he just
35:53
drops his ego and he makes the change but if it's split something they do something they don't he'll just do what
36:00
he wants to do and I think that's pretty wise advice so if all of your betas are annoyed by your heroine or don't
36:06
understand something you got to set your ego aside and make some changes because you're gonna likely get similar feedback
36:13
from your readers now this is one of the reasons too why I recommend having more
36:18
than one beta reader and making sure that whoever you have to Beta read your book has your best interests at heart
36:24
and enjoys your genre you don't want like your really picky critical mom who really hates that you're being a writer
36:30
to edit your book or to Beta Rita because she's not gonna like it and she's going to have negative things to say no matter what you want to find
36:37
people that are cheering for you that want the book to be good that want to enjoy it but are also willing to give
36:42
you better feedback then it was great so once I've inputted all the changes
Copy Edits
36:48
from the beta readers comments it's off to my copy editor or my line editor and
36:54
I use those terms interchangeably but you always want to read your editor's website to see what they distinct
37:01
between a copy editor and a line editor but basically that editor is going to go through it line by line with a fine
37:07
tooth comb and they're going to also point out inconsistencies pacing issues they might point out things like uh
37:14
strange Senate structures or things that didn't quite make sense so they're going to go through line by line and help you
37:20
with sentence formation and things like that when I get their edits back I almost make all usually make all of
Proofread
37:27
those changes and then I will do one final read now sometimes people will ask
37:33
during the editing process should I set my book in a drawer for like a month and
37:38
I know that this is sort of old school advice in tradpub a lot of people would say before you send it out to your agent
37:44
let it sit in the drawer for six months months well I feel like that's very outdated advice because the publishing
37:49
industry moves a lot faster now than it used to but also I find that if I let something sit for too long I lose the
37:57
thread of what I was trying to say the emotional core of the story so I personally don't let my manuscript rest
38:02
however if I have a little bit of time like a week or so I do Let It rest a little bit
38:10
between that final proofread from or between that line edit change and my
38:16
final read through just to give it a little bit of time for me to sort of step away from the emotion of it and
38:22
then read it fresh and on that final read I try to put myself in the mentality of my reader so I will read
38:28
through the last few chapters again of the previous book in the series if there is one get myself into that reader's
38:34
point of view of like this was the Cliffhanger I left them on and now I will start reading and I will try that
38:41
final read through to do it all in one big setting which sometimes can take you
38:46
know an entire day just so I can really get the emotional core I'll make final tweaks I will write things out in a
38:53
notepad and then I will make the final tweaks and then it's off to my proofreader and then it's formatted and
38:59
it's out in the world so that is basically my editing process although I don't necessarily follow all those steps
Final Thoughts
39:06
if the rough draft is in really good shape but if it's the worst it could possibly be that's my full process and
39:13
it may shift a little bit per book but I hope this has sparked something for you if you would like to download any of my
39:19
resources like how to plot your novel how to edit your novel how to write from scenes all of those things you can get them for free when you sign up for my
39:26
newsletter so I will leave a link to sign up down below and if you're interested in updated video series with
39:33
what I know now kind of explaining these things in a little bit more depth after writing I think I've written seven or
39:39
eight books since I did that first plotting series let me know because I think that would be a fun thing to add
39:45
to this YouTube channel coming up as well as more detailed videos on things like backstory and tension and conflict
39:52
and things like that so if you're interested make sure you're subscribed and leave me a comment Down Below on what types of videos on writing you
39:59
would like to see next week we will be back with more Vlogs and I will be actually editing this book which is
40:05
going to feel so good so no matter where you are in the process I hope that you are having fun and embracing your joy
40:11
and also listening to your own heart and your own intuition which is where your best wisdom comes from all my love to
40:18
you and I will see you in my next video bye [Music]

hey everybody welcome back to heart
0:01
breathings today we are going to talk
0:03
about how to crush your writing goals
0:09
okay so today we're going to talk about
0:12
five steps that you can take to start
0:15
really crushing your writing goals I
0:17
know that some of you are here as
0:19
writers who are really struggling to
0:21
either finish your first book or you're
0:23
setting these huge goals for yourself
0:25
like you want to write x number of books
0:27
per year or you've got a number of words
0:30
that you want to hit per day and it's
0:31
just been a struggle so I'm going to
0:33
show you just five quick steps that have
0:34
helped me to begin to really crush my
0:37
writing goals and these are very
0:39
important some of them are tough lessons
0:41
to learn but hopefully you'll stick
0:43
around and listen to these five steps
0:45
and really take them to heart if you
0:47
have some big goals that you've been
0:48
hoping to accomplish in your writing so
0:50
I talked about this a lot but step
0:52
number one is to know what you really
0:54
want so before you can step out and
Get Clear On What You Want
0:58
really motivate yourself and push
1:01
yourself to hit big goals because let's
1:03
face it you know long-term goals like
1:06
how much writing you're gonna do or even
1:07
finishing a novel which can sometimes
1:09
take people years or you might learn to
1:11
do it in months and doesn't really
1:12
matter what your specific process is but
1:15
writing a book is not easy writing an
1:17
entire series is you know infinitely
1:19
harder so these are big things that
1:21
you're taking on these are things that
1:23
there are hundreds of thousands of
1:24
people out there who say I'm gonna write
1:26
a book and then they never do it and
1:29
it's because it's hard so before you
1:31
take on and tackle this really big goal
1:33
of doing something that a lot of people
1:35
just simply cannot do know what it is
1:38
that you want out of it what genre do
1:41
you truly want to be writing what do you
1:44
want to do with this book maybe your
1:46
only goal right now is just I want to
1:48
finish something and see if it's any
1:49
good and that's totally fine too but you
1:52
just need to understand from the start
1:54
why you're doing this what it is that
1:57
you're trying to achieve by doing it
1:59
because when you don't know why you're
2:00
doing something or what the end result
2:02
is that you're hoping for it gets really
2:05
tough when you get into those hard
2:06
places when the book isn't coming and
2:09
you're in the middle or you can't figure
2:10
out the ending and the plot isn't coming
2:12
or
2:13
characters aren't talking to you it gets
2:14
really hard to motivate yourself
2:15
especially if you don't really know why
2:18
you're writing in the first place like
2:19
you have no real goal you have no real
2:21
why no reason why you're doing this you
2:24
don't know what your end result is so it
2:27
gets hard to motivate yourself but if
2:29
you know for example like I want to
2:31
write this book I want to finish this
2:33
book or I want to write these five books
2:34
series so that I can start publishing so
2:36
that I can send my son to this really
2:39
great private school if that was your
2:41
goal if that's your reason why and you
2:44
get really clear on why you're doing
2:46
this then when it gets hard you can
2:48
easily say to yourself okay do I really
2:51
want to send my son to this school he's
2:53
really struggling with the school that
2:54
he's in wouldn't I love to move into a
2:55
nicer neighborhood or wouldn't I really
2:57
love to help my husband be able to quit
3:00
his job that he hates or whatever it is
3:01
your goal is wouldn't I love to be able
3:03
to pay a few bills in the house and help
3:04
out you would love to go on more
3:06
vacations we would love to travel more
3:09
often or I would really really like to
3:11
have something of my own that makes me
3:14
feel like I'm making a difference in the
3:16
world I would really love to have a
3:17
group of fans that feels like a
3:19
community whatever it is that you decide
3:21
as your reason why you're doing this and
3:23
what you want to get out of it when you
3:25
hit those tough spots it's going to be
3:27
easier to either look at a vision board
3:29
where you've got those things laid out
3:30
or look you know into your heart and say
3:32
this is why I want this this is hard but
3:35
I'm gonna not binge watch Netflix
3:37
tonight I'm going to actually sit down
3:39
and do this because this is what I want
3:41
when you don't set that clear reason or
3:43
have a clear destination in mind and
3:46
know exactly what you want out of
3:47
writing it can get really tough to
3:49
motivate yourself through the hard part
3:50
so that's step number one
3:51
step number two and crushing your goals
3:54
is a really tough one even still for me
3:56
is to set realistic goals and yes okay
Step #2
4:00
now I understand that we all want to
4:02
push ourselves a little bit harder I
4:04
know for me personally if I said
4:05
something super easy then and I say you
4:08
know I'm gonna write 500 words in a week
4:10
or something that feels really simple
4:12
then I don't get motivated because I'm
4:14
somebody who is very self-motivated when
4:16
it comes to like pushing myself harder
4:18
but if I say I'm gonna write 40,000
4:21
words in a week then I'm just setting
4:23
myself up for failure because there's
4:24
just very very small
4:26
that unless I work non-stop and
4:28
completely burn myself out I'm probably
4:30
not going to write 40,000 words in a
4:33
week so I have to be somewhere in the
4:36
middle something that is big enough or
4:38
stretch enough to motivate me to make me
4:41
feel like I'm accomplishing something
4:43
that really pushes me forward that
4:44
really moves my goals in the right
4:46
direction that is significant change
4:48
like I've made a significant step
4:50
forward but it is realistic enough that
4:53
I can actually achieve it because it's
4:55
so often that we think okay we're gonna
4:58
set this word count writing goal for
5:00
ourselves I'm gonna finish this book in
5:02
one month or whatever it is that we set
5:04
but we don't look at the whole picture
5:06
to be realistic we don't look at exactly
5:08
how many days we have this month to
5:10
write we don't look at what other things
5:12
are gonna be pulling on our attention
5:13
like this weekend I have on Friday I
5:16
have lunch with my son at his school
5:19
next week we have a teacher's meeting
5:21
with her I also have some birthday
5:24
parties to attend to this weekend and
5:25
then there's spring break at the end of
5:27
March so it's like you have to start
5:29
taking all of those things into
5:30
consideration because if you just say oh
5:32
I've got thirty-one days and I'm gonna
5:34
write four thousand words a day then I
5:36
know I'm gonna get X amount of words
5:38
you're not really looking in a realistic
5:40
manner because even though you can maybe
5:42
write four thousand words in a day that
5:44
has to be like a perfect today that's
5:47
your best day days when you're gonna be
5:49
out with your children or you have
5:52
family visiting or it's spring break or
5:54
you know and truthfully we all get sick
5:57
sometimes we have headaches we don't
5:59
feel like working something happens like
6:01
the tire goes out on the car and you
6:03
have to spend the whole day at the
6:04
mechanic things happen and if you don't
6:07
leave white space in your schedule for
6:09
those kind of emergencies or for the
6:11
actual life to take place then you're
6:14
just setting yourself up for failure
6:15
every single day cannot be your best day
6:18
it's just not going to happen like that
6:19
and if you set yourself up for I'm gonna
6:22
have my best day every single day most
6:24
likely you're setting yourself up for
6:25
failure and the problem with this is not
6:27
so much that okay you're not going to
6:29
hit your goal the problem really is
6:31
mental because what happens is you get
6:34
three days into the month and instead of
6:37
having written those 12,000 words you
6:39
were hoping for you
6:39
only gotten three and then four days
6:41
into the month you're only a 4,000 words
6:43
and you're four days behind or whatever
6:45
and the more you get behind the more you
6:47
start to panic and the more stress you
6:49
start to put on your heart on your brain
6:52
on your body and it just becomes harder
6:56
and harder to actually perform when you
6:58
know you're so behind that it's like
6:59
okay now you don't just have to have
7:01
your best day you have to have your best
7:03
day times twelve and be like yourself on
7:05
steroids in order to catch up or have
7:07
any hope of actually achieving this goal
7:09
and when you get behind so early in the
7:12
month
7:12
it just feels hopeless and so it would
7:16
be so much better trust me on this if
7:18
you would say okay here's how many days
7:22
are in the month here's the days that
7:24
I'm not going to be on my best because I
7:26
know I'm not going to be on my best I've
7:28
got a parent-teacher conference I've got
7:30
you know trip to the beach this weekend
7:32
we've got Spring Break this entire week
7:34
so that narrows me down to about 20
7:37
working days for the month I'm not going
7:40
to assume that I'm gonna be my best say
7:42
my best day is 4,000 words I won't say
7:44
20 times 4,000 words because that would
7:47
be expecting me to be at my best but
7:49
maybe I'll go halfway and say okay I'm
7:51
gonna work 20 days this week and try to
7:53
set a goal of 2,000 words per day so 20
7:57
times 2,000 means that your goal for
8:00
this month is to get 40,000 words and if
8:03
you can get 40,000 words you're gonna be
8:05
a success now there's nobody telling you
8:07
that you can't go above and beyond that
8:09
and get more like 60,000 words if you
8:12
have a few more of those like amazing
8:14
days but this sets you up with a
8:18
realistic expectation so that if you do
8:20
fall behind a couple days in of that
8:23
like best day 4,000 word goal you're
8:25
still actually right on track because
8:27
you were still getting that very kind of
8:29
reasonable goal of 2,000 words and it
8:32
may look different for you your
8:33
reasonable goal on a daily basis may
8:36
only be 400 words and that's fine too
8:38
you cannot start where somebody else is
8:41
you can't start where you wish you were
8:43
you have to start and meet yourself
8:45
exactly where you are and the more you
8:47
judge yourself for where you are and the
8:50
more you compare yourself to other
8:51
people the more you're setting your
8:53
for failure and for those mental traps
8:55
that keep you from crushing your goals
8:59
if you truly want to crush your goal set
9:01
realistic expectations for yourself so
9:05
step number three to crushing your
9:07
writing goals is to make a plan so if
9:09
you're new to this channel you don't
9:11
know this yet but if you've been
Make A Plan
9:12
watching me for a while you know that I
9:14
am definitely a planner person so I love
9:16
plans I love putting them down on paper
9:18
but it's not just that oh it's a hobby
9:21
of mine and I enjoy planning it really
9:23
is useful and you really do need to do
9:25
this so if you want to crush your
9:27
writing goals you have to have some kind
9:29
of plan and remember in the last step
9:31
how I was taking those like numbers and
9:33
I was saying I've got this many days I'm
9:35
gonna try to write like my average word
9:37
count is this you know taking those
9:39
actual numbers and statistics and data
9:41
is important to setting a plan that's
9:43
realistic so what do you do if you don't
9:46
have that data let's say you're a new
9:48
writer or you're someone who's been
9:49
writing for a while but you've never
9:50
really taken the time just to like be
9:52
consistent and say I can write X amount
9:54
of words per day well you can make it a
9:57
project or a goal for yourself in this
9:59
next month to start to learn those kind
10:01
of numbers so what you could do is you
10:03
could say I'm gonna set aside an hour
10:04
every single day and I'm going to write
10:07
you could try different times of day to
10:10
see when you write best so you could say
10:12
for this week I'm going to try one hour
10:13
every single morning at 7 a.m. and I'm
10:16
gonna see how I do you keep track this
10:18
is where you're gonna need a notebook so
10:20
pull out one of those notebooks and join
10:23
the HP notebook challenge which I'll
10:24
link for you down below if you're
10:26
interested but you could keep track of
10:28
it in a notebook start writing down okay
10:30
you know I'm going to write from 7 a.m.
10:32
to 8 a.m. every day and you know say you
10:35
start tracking it and you realize at 7
10:37
a.m. you get a best thousand words a day
10:39
on average then you're gonna try for a
10:42
week 3 p.m. ok when I you know pick up
10:45
my son from school I'm gonna come home
10:47
and I'm gonna write for an hour after he
10:49
gets home while he's like playing with
10:50
his toys in this room so you're gonna
10:52
write from 3 to 4 p.m. 3 to 4 p.m.
10:55
you're a little bit more distracted so
10:56
your average is only more like 600 words
10:58
per day now you have more information
11:00
that you're a better writer in the
11:01
mornings then you are in the distracted
11:03
afternoons so the next week maybe try
11:06
I'm
11:06
gonna write evenings after dinner
11:08
instead of sitting down to watch TV I'm
11:11
gonna sit down in it from 8:00 to 9:00
11:12
p.m. after my kids are in bed and I am
11:14
going to sorry I know I'm like keep
11:17
talking about kids but this is my life
11:18
so if you don't have kids set your own
11:20
schedule maybe you're in college and
11:22
you're say after I finished my homework
11:23
from 11:00 to 12:00 you know I'm gonna
11:25
sit down I'm gonna write at night so you
11:27
sit down you see oh my gosh from 11:00
11:30
to 12:00 or from 8:00 to 9:00 p.m. in
11:32
the evenings
11:33
I'm so tired by that point I'm getting
11:35
hardly any words I'm only averaging like
11:37
300 words per night so in that case if
11:40
you were that person and you would look
11:42
at those three times you would say okay
11:44
morning time is my time now you've got
11:46
that data that's going to help you begin
11:47
to really hone in on when your best
11:50
writing time is when you perform best
11:52
and that's going to help you hit your
11:54
writing goals because instead of like
11:56
let's say you were trying to write every
11:57
night before bed and you were only
11:58
getting 300 words a day and you were
12:00
starting to get frustrated by only
12:02
writing you know 3 to 6,000 words per
12:04
month well now you've learned that if
12:06
you can get up every morning just a
12:07
little bit earlier and write in the
12:09
morning you can get 5,000 words per week
12:11
so now you're starting to get more like
12:14
20,000 words you have just more than
12:16
quadrupled your output for the month
12:18
because instead of getting three or
12:20
6,000 words you're getting 20,000 words
12:22
you've just exponentially improved the
12:25
number of words you can write per month
12:27
so sometimes making that plan and coming
12:29
up with a strategy to figure out your
12:30
process can be one of the most powerful
12:33
things you can do now let's say you're
12:35
somebody who's been writing for quite a
12:36
while and you kind of know this is your
12:38
time to write like you know that from 5
12:40
to 6 p.m. every night before dinner this
12:42
is your best like perfect time to write
12:44
so you've already figured that out
12:46
so part of my process is you know I have
12:49
this 90 day plan and I decide when it
12:52
comes to my writing goals I always have
12:54
at least one writing goal so you can see
12:56
kind of piece of my Kanban board over
12:58
there where I've got the dark blue kind
13:00
of on the far side there that is my
13:02
writing goal so what I do is I have
13:04
every 90 days a specific writing goal of
13:06
how much I want to get done but I don't
13:08
just say I'm gonna write 40,000 words
13:11
this month and leave it at that I have
13:13
an actual plan and that helps me to meet
13:15
my goals because it's very specific and
13:17
the more
13:18
specific you can get the easier it is to
13:20
not only motivate yourself but to
13:22
actually follow through with it because
13:23
you know when you're going to be writing
13:25
why you're writing what you're writing
13:27
and all of those sorts of things you're
13:29
not wasting time going I don't know when
13:31
I'm going to write today you kind of
13:33
already know because you haven't mapped
13:35
out in your 90-day plan when you're
13:37
going to write so part of my plan always
13:39
involves what times a day am I going to
13:42
write usually I have a specific time to
13:43
write during the week and something
13:45
different on the weekends so I know how
13:47
many hours I'm going to be able to
13:48
dedicate so if you have a full-time job
13:50
you may have specific times either early
13:53
in the morning on your lunch break or
13:55
sometime in the afternoon or evenings
13:57
when you know every single day of the
13:58
week you can sit down and write so even
14:00
if it's 20 minutes or if it's an hour
14:02
and a half you can set aside that time
14:04
and your schedule may be different like
14:06
Monday's you've got an hour Tuesday you
14:08
have two hours no time on Wednesdays and
14:10
etc but if you can kind of map that out
14:12
then you can have a very clear picture
14:15
of how many hours you're going to be
14:17
able to work throughout the week so once
14:19
you know when you're going to write you
14:20
may even want to go so far as to say
14:22
where you're going to write that can be
14:24
a big part of your plan another part of
14:26
my plan
14:26
that is usually very important to me is
14:29
that I also plan rewards for myself
14:31
setting yourself rewards and making that
14:33
part of your plan whether you make it a
14:34
daily reward a weekly reward a monthly
14:36
reward doesn't matter it's just what
14:39
motivates you that can also be something
14:41
that can help you to crush your writing
14:43
goals step number four is to stay
14:44
focused and this is one where you're
14:47
probably like yes they're a duh I know I
Shay Focused
14:49
need to stay focused but how in the
14:50
world do I do it well I do have a video
14:53
that I will link down below for you on
14:54
ways to stay focused or how to write
14:56
when you don't feel like it those kinds
14:58
of things so I have a couple videos on
15:00
that that I'll link for you down below
15:01
but also just know this like the steps
15:05
that you've taken so far are going to
15:07
help you stay focused you know exactly
15:09
why you're doing this what your outcome
15:11
is that you're hoping to achieve you
15:13
know when you're supposed to write
15:14
you've been realistic about it when you
15:16
set these huge goals it gets so much
15:19
harder to stay focused because it's like
15:20
okay I'm already thirty thousand words
15:22
behind you set realistic goals and
15:24
suddenly you become motivated to
15:26
actually get it done so trust me when I
15:29
say the first three steps are going to
15:30
help
15:31
to stay more focused but another thing
15:33
is with at you know as writers we have
15:37
lots and lots of different ideas when
15:39
things get really tough with the writing
15:41
we have a tendency a lot of us maybe not
15:43
all of you but I know it happens to me
15:45
and it happens to a lot of us where you
15:47
start to say this is getting too hard
15:49
maybe this isn't the right story maybe
15:50
this isn't what I should be working on
15:52
right now and then those plot Bunnie
15:54
start kind of hopping into the picture
15:56
where it's like oh but look at this new
15:57
shiny idea and you know this dystopian
15:59
thing would be really cool or what about
16:01
this mystery and you then go and watch a
16:03
movie and you're like inspired now to
16:04
write science fiction and you start to
16:06
get distracted and you allow yourself to
16:09
kind of slide off of your commitment
16:10
that this is the book I'm working on and
16:12
maybe you work on something else one of
16:14
the number one things that can make us
16:16
do that slide off the focus and the
16:18
commitment is the fact that the book got
16:20
hard and this is where a lot of people
16:23
begin to fail because when you get even
16:26
if you've got the whole thing plotted
16:27
they're almost inevitably for all of us
16:30
comes a point in the writing where it
16:31
just gets hard the characters aren't
16:33
talking to you the plot isn't coming
16:35
together the way you wanted and the best
16:37
advice I can have for you is just push
16:39
through it doesn't have to be perfect in
16:42
the first draft you just have to keep
16:43
writing so staying focused at this
16:46
critical point is one of the hardest
16:49
things but it's also one of the most
16:50
important things you can do if you want
16:52
to crush your writing goals you have to
16:54
learn to stay focused when the writing
16:56
gets tough it's not an easy thing to
16:58
hear you want some kind of sure things
17:01
you know straight bullet through to you
17:03
know how you're gonna finish this and
17:05
stay focused the truth is this is why a
17:07
lot of people can't be writers this is
17:09
why a lot of people fail but this is why
17:11
you're not going to fail because you're
17:13
going to keep at it all you have to do
17:15
is take that plan that you made that hey
17:17
I'm going to be writing for this many
17:19
minutes on this day and this is where
17:21
I'm gonna do it and you just sit down
17:22
and you keep trying just keep letting
17:24
words flow even if you're just talking
17:26
to yourself and brainstorming well what
17:28
if she went into this cafe and there was
17:29
a murderer there and it gave her this
17:31
clue and it did this thing okay that's
17:33
stupid I'm not going to do that you can
17:34
just rewrite free brainstorm push
17:38
yourself through it you could say you
17:39
know what I'm not sure exactly where
17:41
this story's going but I had this idea
17:43
that maybe the
17:44
characters are gonna take a road trip to
17:45
DC so you just start writing that if it
17:47
doesn't feel right start writing
17:49
something else but the thing is you have
17:50
to just keep going if you allow yourself
17:53
when the writing gets tough and you
17:55
start to get distracted and you've been
17:57
working on this so long and it feels
17:58
like it's not coming together that's
18:00
when it's crucial because it means
18:02
you're very close to making a
18:04
breakthrough and you have to stay
18:06
focused and sometimes it's gonna be a
18:08
matter of almost forcing yourself to
18:10
stay focused but you have to do it and
18:12
like I said following those early steps
18:14
of knowing why setting the realistic
18:16
goals and making that plan is gonna help
18:18
you stay focused you could even try
18:20
having some kind of accountability
18:21
partner when you run into this chopped
18:23
trouble like meeting somebody else
18:25
online or having a friend that you trust
18:27
or having your parents or your husband
18:29
or your best friend right you know that
18:32
you have to say to them every day here's
18:33
how many words I wrote yes I got it done
18:35
have somebody checking in with you so
18:37
you've got that accountability if you
18:38
need it maybe find another writer so
18:41
that you're both holding each other
18:42
accountable or find a writing group
18:44
online but this is the crucial time to
18:46
stay focused because if you allow
18:48
yourself to say this is getting too hard
18:50
I think I'm just going to turn on
18:51
Netflix
18:52
you're not going to crush your writing
18:53
goals you have to stay focused and get
18:56
it done the final tip that I have for
18:57
you the final step that I have for you
18:59
is one of the toughest ones and this is
19:02
more tough love but you have to stop
19:04
making excuses one of the number one
Stop Making Excuse
19:06
things that I see people happy to see
19:09
happening with people that just haven't
19:10
finished their books and can never get
19:12
through is that they're constantly
19:13
making excuses and one of the biggest
19:15
excuses is I just don't have time and
19:18
you know I understand that life is tough
19:22
that we're all in different situations
19:24
you know maybe you have kids maybe you
19:26
have you know full-time job and you're
19:28
putting yourself through college or you
19:30
may have two jobs that everybody has
19:32
different situations and I understand
19:34
that but we all have the same 24 hours
19:37
in a day and it's up to you it's to find
19:40
the places where you can make your
19:43
writing a priority when you just don't
19:46
have a plan you don't really know when
19:47
you're going to do it then every time
19:49
you get home and you've been working all
19:51
day and you're tired you're just not
19:53
going to feel like it that's going to
19:55
happen over and over and over and I
19:57
no some of you have been stuck in that
19:58
rut for years because I talked to people
20:01
all the time where they say I just don't
20:02
have time and then I'll start to talk to
20:04
them about what their schedule is like
20:06
and you find out that actually between
20:08
the hours of 5 o'clock and 11 o'clock in
20:11
the evenings they have infinite amount
20:13
of time but they just don't feel like it
20:16
work is tough I understand it it's hard
20:18
to get yourself motivated but you're the
20:20
one making the excuse that I don't have
20:22
time and then choosing to watch Netflix
20:25
or YouTube videos or sit in color or
20:28
text your friends or play Facebook games
20:31
and I have no judgment on people that
20:34
play games and all that stuff because I
20:36
play World of Warcraft I love to play
20:38
games online and stuff too but the
20:41
writing has to become a priority and
20:43
it's up to you to stop making an excuse
20:45
and make the writing a priority if you
20:47
sit down and you say these are the times
20:49
that I'm going to write no one's going
20:51
to make you do it it becomes up to you
20:53
to be the person who does it and if you
20:56
want to crush your writing goals you
20:57
have to just become the kind of person
20:59
who sits down and writes when they say
21:01
they're going to write and that means
21:02
not making excuses anymore and this is
21:05
like I said a little harsher than I like
21:07
to be because I like to be nothing but
21:09
encouraging but this is just the truth
21:11
and it makes me so sad when I see people
21:14
and even dear friends of mine who
21:16
constantly are making excuses about well
21:18
this story isn't coming together and I
21:20
think I did this wrong and I just don't
21:22
have time to write and I'm too tired in
21:23
this afternoon and gosh it's been a
21:25
really tough week and it's like I
21:26
understand that but you are choosing to
21:29
get caught in that story for years and
21:32
never finish a book and the worst thing
21:35
that you could do is get to the end of
21:36
your life and look back on all these
21:38
nights and think what did I do with my
21:40
time yeah okay so I watched all these TV
21:43
shows or you know I did all these
21:45
puzzles or I played all these games but
21:47
I never sat down and write and why
21:49
didn't I do it why didn't I finally
21:51
finish that book that's on nobody but
21:53
you because you made that choice every
21:55
afternoon life is tough
21:57
I'm tired a lot too and I'm about to
21:59
welcome a new baby into my family so
22:00
there's going to be a lot of tired times
22:02
I had a son when I was right in the
22:04
middle of my career my first child I had
22:07
him in 2012 it was tough to get back to
22:10
because I was tired I was exhausted all
22:12
the time but I made myself get back to
22:14
the writing because it was what I wanted
22:16
to do I knew exactly I was very clear on
22:19
what I wanted to do with my life and at
22:21
some point I had to just stop laying on
22:23
the excuses of I'm really tired and
22:25
believe me I have sympathy for those of
22:27
you that are tired or that do a lot of
22:29
stuff but if you want to crush your
22:31
writing goals you're going to have to
22:32
just leave those excuses behind and
22:34
start realistic I'm not saying that you
22:37
need to say I'm never gonna watch TV
22:38
anymore and I'm gonna write from 5:00 to
22:40
11:00 every night you don't have to
22:42
start there but you can start very small
22:43
and you can say you know remember those
22:45
rewards I was talking about you can get
22:47
home and say okay I'm gonna give myself
22:48
30 minutes to like relax grab a cup of
22:51
coffee when I get home but from 5:30 to
22:53
6:00 every single night I'm gonna do one
22:55
writing sprint it's fine to just start
22:58
there let go of the excuses of I'm too
23:00
tired and instead say to yourself I'm
23:04
just gonna get this done and I'm gonna
23:05
do it and I'm gonna commit to it every
23:07
single day those 30 minutes a day could
23:09
mean eventually thousands and thousands
23:12
Awards which means that eventually you
23:13
finish your first novel so stop with the
23:16
excuses start in a realistic manner take
23:19
small steps to making your dreams come
23:21
true and I promise you you're going to
23:23
start to see results okay so it just has
23:25
a recap know exactly and get very clear
23:28
on what you want set realistic goals
23:30
with the time you have create a plan
23:32
that you decide when and where you're
23:34
going to write stay focused even when it
23:37
gets hard and let go of those excuses
23:39

[Music]

hey guys welcome back to another video
0:02
today we are going to talk about how to
0:04
set realistic writing goals which I know
0:08
for a lot of us this can be a big
0:10
problem so if you're interested in some
0:12
of my best tips keep watching if some of
0:18
you have heard me talk about this before
0:20
but setting writing goals is easy right
0:23
you can just set a time and say oh I'm
0:25
gonna write this many words per day
0:26
where the trick comes in is setting
0:29
realistic writing goals the writing
0:31
goals that you can actually achieve
0:33
without feeling like you're falling way
0:35
behind or that you're failing or that
0:38
you're just not getting things done as
0:40
fast as you should so often right now
0:44
especially as indie authors if you're an
0:46
indie author we're in this time where
0:48
people are talking about rush rush rush
0:51
rapid release get books out as fast as
0:53
you can but even though there are some
0:56
authors who can really write fast or
0:59
book a month book every two weeks not
1:01
all of us are like that me for example
1:04
my average is two to three books a year
1:07
which I feel like is actually still
1:08
really really good last year was my best
1:11
year I wrote five I actually published
1:13
five books wrote six books last year in
1:16
2018 but this year in 2019 because I've
1:20
been pregnant and struggling to write
1:23
because I have had major pregnancy brain
1:26
I have not finished or published a book
1:28
at all this year
1:29
so depending on where you are in your
1:31
life what other things you have going on
1:34
whether you are dealing with a sick
1:36
family member your own chronic illness
1:39
or a full-time job or changes in your
1:42
environment a move whatever it is you're
1:44
dealing with it's important to set
1:47
realistic writing goals for where you
1:49
are in your life to honor the seasons
1:51
and the stages of your life by setting
1:54
realistic goals because what happens
1:56
more often than not with a lot of people
1:58
who are overachievers or who have big
2:01
dreams for their life is instead of
2:04
setting realistic goals which can
2:06
sometimes feel painful because it's not
2:07
fast enough we will often set best case
2:12
Aereo goals and this was a trap that I
2:14
fell into pretty hardcore a few years
2:17
back where I said instead of being
2:20
realistic about what I could actually
2:22
get done I was expecting myself to be
2:26
super Sarah best writer I've ever been
2:29
in my life every single day all the time
2:31
so instead of saying okay I usually can
2:34
write two books a year I'm going to set
2:36
a goal to write two books a year or even
2:38
just bumping it up to three I would get
2:40
to a point right say okay this year I'm
2:42
gonna write seven books and I would set
2:44
this ridiculous schedule and those of
2:46
you who have been around for a while or
2:48
taking some of my courses have heard
2:50
this story before but it's worth
2:51
repeating because it's it's a painful
2:54
process that I went through and I
2:56
learned a lot from it which is that I
2:57
would go into Google Calendar and I
3:01
would clear everything off so it was
3:02
just a blank monthly calendar and I
3:05
would print it off for the entire year
3:07
get my highlighters you guys know
3:09
obviously I'm a planner girl this is
3:11
like procrastinate I would take my
3:14
highlighters my washi tape everything
3:16
else and I would come up with a
3:18
color-coded system for which books I was
3:20
going to write and I would sit down with
3:22
my stack of 12 monthly you know
3:24
calendars for the year and I would come
3:26
up with a schedule but instead of being
3:28
realistic about what I was going to work
3:30
on I would be super Sarah and say that
3:34
okay if my best day is 3000 words on
3:37
average a day I'm gonna write four
3:40
thousand words a day because all I have
3:42
to do is add an extra hour in and I know
3:43
I can do it so then I would expect
3:45
myself to finish an eighty thousand word
3:47
book in 20 days and I wasn't taking into
3:50
consideration the fact that sometimes we
3:52
get sick or sometimes my son gets sick
3:54
or that I actually had a parent-teacher
3:57
night and a course to give and a
4:00
speaking gig during those 20 days I
4:02
would just say oh every day I'm going to
4:04
write my absolute best word count ever
4:06
and then what would happen inevitably is
4:09
after I had spent two or three days
4:11
coming up with this perfect calendar
4:13
where I was gonna write seven or eight
4:14
books in a year I would get two weeks in
4:17
to the year and the whole schedule would
4:19
be messed up because I was behind so
4:22
instead of writing those 80,000 words in
4:24
20 days
4:25
I would realize 20 days have gone by and
4:27
I've only written 20,000 words and so
4:30
what I would do instead of saying okay
4:33
well I'm going to adjust this schedule
4:35
to be more realistic no that would have
4:37
been too easy is I would go back to
4:40
Google Calendar reprint the entire year
4:43
set up with my highlighters and figure
4:46
out how I could get ahead so instead of
4:48
saying well now I'm going to back it up
4:51
and only expect myself to write you know
4:53
the true average or realistic average of
4:55
2,000 words a day or a thousand words a
4:59
day I would say well I've got to catch
5:01
up because I'm way behind and I would
5:02
start to expect myself to write five
5:04
thousand words a day with no break in
5:06
between and just go go go go go and of
5:08
course what would happen in another
5:10
couple of weeks I would be way behind
5:12
again and I was never hitting my goals
5:14
and that had a trickle-down effect
5:16
because not only was I behind I was also
5:20
super stressed and I was being extremely
5:22
hard on myself mentally because I would
5:24
go in and say things to myself like why
5:27
are you such a failure Sarah why can't
5:29
you get it together why can't you be a
5:31
better writer
5:32
look at how awful you're doing you're
5:34
completely failing and I had all of this
5:36
negative self-talk going on and of
5:38
course that does not make it easy to be
5:40
creative and have fun you know wasn't
5:43
having any fun with my work and so it
5:45
made me constantly feel burned out and
5:46
just crummy and unhappy all the time
5:49
that had a trickle-down effect to my
5:51
family because I was snapping at my
5:53
young son all the time I was not being
5:56
happy with my husband I wasn't spending
5:57
enough time with him whenever he would
5:59
say let's play a game together I would
6:00
be like I can't afford to play a game
6:02
I'm way too busy and I would just
6:04
constantly be stressed well I finally
6:06
hit a point where I said this is just
6:08
not the way I want to live and I'm
6:11
sharing this with you guys because I
6:13
have a feeling that some of you out
6:15
there need to hear this because you're
6:17
in the same place where I was a few
6:19
years ago and it's easy for me even now
6:22
to slip back into that place where I
6:24
feel like especially right now I've just
6:27
had a baby ten days ago as I'm recording
6:30
this and I haven't had a new book
6:33
release all year my sales are down my
6:36
income
6:36
down from those books and so there's
6:39
this sense of panic like I need to catch
6:41
up I need to write how many books can I
6:43
write by the rest of the end of this
6:44
year so I filled those old tendencies of
6:47
panic where I'm starting to say to
6:49
myself you know if I really work hard
6:51
how many books can I finish by the end
6:52
of this year and could I write four
6:53
thousand words a day you know all this
6:55
stuff and so I have to step back and say
6:58
alright how can I be realistic and be
7:03
happy with what I'm getting done so with
7:06
that big intro show sharing my own
7:08
experience let me tell you what I think
7:10
my biggest tips are for really setting
7:13
realistic writing goals where you don't
7:15
feel overwhelmed but you're actually
7:17
getting things done so the first step is
7:20
to know your averages this is so
7:24
important when you are trying to figure
7:26
out what your writing goals are going to
7:29
be and how long it's going to take you
7:30
to finish a book it's important to know
7:33
how long it takes you to write a
7:35
thousand words or if you have an hour
7:37
what's your average number of words per
7:39
hour especially when you're drafting
7:41
it's so important to know your averages
7:44
what about plotting do you need time to
7:46
plot or are you a pantser how much time
7:49
do you need and sometimes if you're
7:52
brand-new to writing and you haven't
7:54
actually finished a book before or
7:55
you're just getting started you're not
7:57
going to know your averages yet because
7:59
you need data over time to come up with
8:02
an average but it's important when
8:04
you're first getting started to at least
8:06
start paying attention to how long it
8:09
takes you if you've been writing lots of
8:12
novels like I've written 26 novels you
8:15
start to get to know how long it takes
8:17
you so I know that in an average 20
8:21
minutes print I can write 800 to a
8:23
thousand words and that's kind of my
8:25
average if you want to know what your
8:29
averages are then something you can do
8:31
is what I just said is writing sprints
8:33
so set a timer for 20 minutes 15 minutes
8:36
whatever feels good to you just pick a
8:38
time limit I wouldn't go beyond an hour
8:41
and I wouldn't go under say 10 minutes
8:43
maybe but come up with a set period of
8:45
time and then just run a few sprints
8:48
so this is called the Pomodoro Technique
8:50
talked about it before on my channel you
8:51
would basically just set a timer for say
8:53
20 minutes and then sit down and write I
8:56
have this very cute erin condren
8:59
hourglass now that I absolutely love and
9:02
it goes for 20 minutes so if you have
9:05
something like this or you have a
9:06
kitchen timer or just a timer on your
9:08
phone you can set it for 20 minutes and
9:10
then get to writing keep track of how
9:12
many words you wrote so at the end of
9:14
that writing sprint you can say okay I
9:16
wrote 423 words during that 20 minutes
9:19
take a little bit of a break like 5 or
9:21
10 minutes and then come back to it and
9:23
do another 20 minute writing sprint if
9:25
you do that over the course of a week
9:27
say one or two sprints a day over the
9:29
course of a week you're going to have
9:30
enough data to look back and say on
9:33
average in 20 minutes I can write 450
9:37
words that data is going to be so
9:40
important to you because when you are
9:42
looking at your time and trying to
9:45
estimate or guesstimate how long it's
9:48
going to take you to write say a 50,000
9:50
word novel now you can say if I can
9:54
write 450 words in 20 minutes
9:58
how many 20 minute Sprint's am I going
10:00
to need to write 50,000 words let's
10:04
figure that out I don't do math in my
10:07
head my son who's only 7 could probably
10:10
do that math and I said I cannot so
10:13
50,000 words divided by 450 means that
10:17
you're gonna need about a hundred and
10:18
eleven twenty minute Sprint's if you can
10:21
do two of those an hour we divide that
10:23
by two so you're going to need about 55
10:26
to 60 hours of writing to finish your
10:30
rough draft if you can write for an hour
10:33
a day which is 2 to 20 minute Sprint's
10:36
with a break in between then it's gonna
10:38
take you about 55 to 60 days of writing
10:42
and that's going to help you set a
10:44
realistic writing goal that's why you
10:46
need to know your averages same thing
10:48
goes for all of the steps in the process
10:50
how long is it going to take you to plot
10:53
this book do you have an average amount
10:56
of time that it takes you to go through
10:58
the plot how long will it take you to
10:59
write the rough draft how long does it
11:01
take you to edit if like ice
11:03
you're brand-new to writing and you'd
11:05
have never finished a book before then
11:07
maybe what you want to do is you know we
11:09
talked about September and we talked
11:10
about the note book challenge on this
11:12
channel a lot create a new notebook
11:14
where you can track off your Sprint's or
11:16
set up a spreadsheet on your computer
11:19
where you can track your Sprint's track
11:21
your time and you know really pay
11:23
attention to how long it took you to
11:25
plot this book how long it took you to
11:26
write you know the rough draft and that
11:28
sort of thing so once you know your
11:30
averages that's going to help you
11:31
realistically project how long it's
11:34
going to take you to finish a book where
11:36
I was making mistakes before was instead
11:38
of actually taking my real average I
11:40
would take my best case scenario and say
11:42
my best writing sprint of all time was
11:45
in 20 minutes I wrote 1500 words so then
11:48
I was using that best case scenario to
11:50
figure out my targets and that was a
11:53
huge mistake be realistic by setting
11:55
your real average and if you want to
11:57
actually be more realistic you could
11:59
actually bring that average down a
12:01
little bit so if your true average is
12:03
450 words maybe you want to bump it down
12:05
to 400 so that you give yourself a
12:07
little bit of a cushion there the second
12:09
tip for setting realistic writing goals
12:11
is to know your target so now that you
12:14
know your averages and about how long it
12:15
takes you to complete each step on
12:17
average you need to know what you're
12:20
headed towards what's your target word
12:22
count what's your target for this book
12:24
so if you're writing a young adult
12:27
fantasy book for example maybe your
12:30
target is going to be 80,000 words or
12:32
maybe you're writing an epic fantasy
12:34
novel and your target is gonna be
12:35
200,000 words maybe you're writing a
12:38
standalone horror novel that's only
12:40
going to be 65,000 words or maybe you're
12:42
writing a romance novella that's only
12:45
going to be 17,000 words but if you want
12:48
to calculate your realistic amount of
12:51
time that it's gonna take you you need
12:52
to know what your target word count is
12:55
now again if you are not an experienced
12:58
writer and you're just getting started
13:00
this is gonna be a guessing game and
13:01
that's fine don't let it stress you out
13:03
that you don't know exactly how many
13:04
words this is gonna be I continually
13:06
even now underestimate how long things
13:09
are gonna be I'll say oh I think this
13:10
book is gonna be 80 it comes up to be
13:12
95,000 words so don't feel like this has
13:15
to be perfect
13:16
if you're setting a realistic goal for
13:17
yourself you've got to have some kind of
13:20
target that you think you're working
13:21
toward so either figure out from your
13:25
outline how long you think it's going to
13:27
be or just take an average like most why
13:30
a novels are 70,000 words so I'm gonna
13:32
shoot for 70,000 words and then you can
13:35
just adjust it and learn as you go and
13:36
where this will help you is if you know
13:38
you write a thousand words on average a
13:40
thousand words an hour and you're
13:42
writing a 50,000 word book then you can
13:45
know that you're going to need about
13:46
fifty hours because 50,000 words divided
13:50
by a thousand an hour is 50 hours so
13:53
that is going to help you come up with
13:55
how many hours it's going to take you to
13:57
finish the rough draft tip number three
14:00
is to know your schedule so rather than
14:03
just saying to yourself well I know I'm
14:05
gonna write a thousand words a day if
14:07
you want to be realistic you have to
14:08
actually pull out a calendar and see how
14:11
many working days you have because if
14:13
you just say I'm gonna start today and
14:15
I'm going to write for the next fifty
14:16
days a thousand words a day maybe you're
14:20
not taking into consideration that it's
14:22
your husband's birthday or that you have
14:24
a big exam coming up at school or that
14:27
you've got this big project at work and
14:29
you're gonna be out of town for a
14:30
conference for three days over the next
14:32
60 days you have to really take out a
14:34
calendar and figure out how many working
14:36
days you have so when you pull out your
14:39
calendar you need to identify those days
14:42
where you have stuff going on that
14:45
you're just not likely to be writing it
14:47
could be something going on with your
14:49
kids it could be something going on if
14:51
you're a student with your school it
14:52
could be something like conferences or
14:55
whatever but just identify those days
14:57
where you're not likely to write and
14:59
this is another mental place I used to
15:02
be when I was making those crazy
15:04
schedules I used to say to myself like
15:06
even if I was going to be at a big
15:07
conference I would say well I'll get up
15:09
early in the morning or right before bed
15:11
I'm still gonna write those thousand
15:12
words I there was literally zero chance
15:15
I was gonna be writing any words while I
15:18
was at a major conference those things
15:19
take up so much time and energy there
15:22
was just no way I'm not the type of
15:23
person who's gonna sit down and write
15:25
those thousand words so the fact that I
15:27
took those days and
15:28
consideration expecting myself to write
15:31
was just setting myself up for failure
15:32
and not being realistic at all so if you
15:35
want to be realistic pull out that
15:37
calendar know your schedule figure out
15:39
how many hours a day you have to work
15:41
and figure out how many days you're
15:44
actually going to be working it may take
15:46
you 50 days to finish the rough draft
15:48
50,000 words but they might not be fifty
15:51
consecutive days there might be some
15:53
days in between there where you have to
15:55
take some time off so give yourself that
15:57
time and know your schedule then the
15:59
final tip that I have for you is you
16:01
have your averages you have your target
16:03
and now you've figured out your schedule
16:05
always add additional time so let's say
16:08
you said it was going to take you you
16:11
know the next 90 days to finish this
16:12
book like you were gonna finish it in q4
16:14
coming up of 2019 and say you were super
16:17
realistic you took Thanksgiving week off
16:20
you took Christmas week off and you're
16:22
giving yourself you know New Year's Eve
16:24
off as well so you've given yourself
16:26
those days but that is all the time
16:28
you've given yourself if you really want
16:30
to set a realistic writing goal and
16:32
you've been someone who struggled in the
16:34
past with hitting those deadlines then I
16:37
highly encourage you to take additional
16:39
time so instead of saying you know I'm
16:42
only going to take these five days off
16:44
over the next 90 days really give
16:46
yourself like an extra week the same way
16:48
that you get sick days when you have a
16:50
job or whatever you have this you know
16:52
the sick days that you're allowed to
16:53
take or vacation leave give yourself
16:55
sick days when it comes to setting your
16:57
writing schedule because there are I
16:59
guarantee you going to be some days
17:01
coming up where you just don't feel like
17:03
writing or something comes up and it's
17:05
an emergency or you're just not able to
17:07
write and that if that happens one or
17:10
two times
17:11
there's no way to catch up because
17:13
you're already giving yourself you know
17:16
the amount of time that you have how are
17:18
you going to catch up that time without
17:20
feeling stressed so give yourself
17:22
additional sort of sick days to be more
17:25
realistic I think that one of the worst
17:28
things that we can do to ourselves or
17:30
trying to set writing deadlines and
17:32
writing goals is to expect ourselves to
17:34
be working at our maximum most amazing
17:38
capacity times
17:40
and don't expect yourself to be the
17:42
number one best version of you every
17:44
single day because it's probably just
17:46
not going to happen we can we can
17:49
motivate ourselves to a certain extent
17:51
we can really set ourselves up for
17:52
success but there's always going to be
17:54
things that come up unexpectedly there's
17:56
going to be days where we don't feel
17:57
well we have headaches we have you know
17:59
some of us deal with chronic illnesses
18:01
or depression some of us have you know a
18:03
lot of things going on with our family
18:05
or our jobs or school and you just have
18:07
to give yourself that leeway but the
18:09
more realistic you can truly be the more
18:12
you're going to feel at ease and at
18:15
peace with what you're doing if you are
18:18
pushing yourself like to the limit maybe
18:22
you can do it for one or two books or
18:23
one or two quarters but eventually
18:25
you're going to burn out and you're
18:26
gonna feel stressed and you're gonna
18:27
feel behind and you're gonna feel like a
18:29
failure and that is going to put you in
18:31
a place where it's very difficult to not
18:33
only love what you're writing but to
18:36
really put your full self into it and
18:38
there's just no need to live in a state
18:41
of constant stress and overwhelm so do
18:44
yourself a favor get to know your
18:46
averages if you don't know them yet then
18:48
work out a system to figure out your
18:51
averages we did a word sprint challenge
18:54
earlier this year and I have a word
18:56
sprinting group if you are a writer and
18:58
you would like to join the word sprint
19:00
group for heart breathing's feel free to
19:02
join it I will put a link down below
19:03
where you can come join us and we're
19:05
going to be doing some fun averages and
19:08
word Sprint's together for NaNoWriMo
19:09
this year and probably some for prep
19:11
tober coming up next month so I'd love
19:13
to have you join us you can find that
19:15
link for the Facebook group down below
19:17
but know your averages if you don't
19:19
already know them work toward getting to
19:21
know them and keeping track of them then
19:24
know your target what's your target word
19:26
count goal what's your target for how
19:29
long this book is going to be and then
19:31
know your schedule know what days you're
19:33
available to work what days you're not
19:35
and then finally give yourself some
19:37
extra sick days or mental health days
19:40
there in between so that you have a
19:42
buffer if you think it's going to take
19:43
you six weeks to finish the book add a
19:45
couple additional weeks and give
19:46
yourself eight weeks so you have that
19:48
breathing room in case something
19:50
happens or comes up and you need to take
19:52
time off and I promise you'll thank me
19:54
that for that later the worst thing that
19:56
can happen if you give yourself those
19:57
eight weeks is that you finish early
19:59
right and then you'll feel really good
20:01
but it's better to have that extra time
20:04
and feel peace and relief and like
20:06
you're right on target and have that
20:08
confidence because that is going to help
20:11
you to really be more creative and be
20:14
more joyful in your writing and that
20:15
just has you know the same way the
20:19
stress has that trickle-down effect so
20:21
does the joy it has that trickle through
20:22
your whole life effect and the more
20:24
joyful you are the more you're enjoying
20:26
the process the better your writing is
20:27
going to be and the better you're going
20:29
to be in terms of showing up for your
20:31
family and for the people that you love
20:32
and you're just gonna feel better on a
20:35
daily basis so give yourself that extra
20:37
time and don't expect yourself to be
20:40
superhuman when you're writing I
20:42
featured this on my channel last year
20:44
when I was talking about how to set
20:46
realistic deadlines for your writing but
20:48
I'm also gonna link down below to a free
20:51
beat that you can get over on my blog at
20:52
heart breathing's calm so it's just a
20:55
it's just a sheet to help you kind of
20:58
write out what your deadlines are for
21:00
your writing schedule so you might find
21:02
that useful to go along with this if you
21:04
have already signed up for my mailing
21:06
list then you can find a link to
21:07
download that if you don't already have
21:09
it in your email from me this week so
21:11
make sure to go find that in your email
21:12
in your inbox but before you go I also
21:15
wanted to mention that my HP 90 do camp
21:18
is now open for enrollment this only
21:20
opens a few times a year but what we do
21:23
in this course is it starts on Thursday
21:25
September 19th with a live kickoff call
21:28
for me where you get lots of motivation
21:29
and information about what you're gonna
21:31
get over the course of the weekend then
21:33
we spend the entire weekend really
21:35
focusing on what is your long-term
21:38
vision for your life and then coming up
21:40
with a 90 day plan that is going to help
21:43
you move towards your biggest goals in
21:45
life and we break down the big goals
21:48
into manageable projects and tasks so
21:51
you want to talk about setting realistic
21:52
writing goals this is going to help you
21:54
set realistic goals it tells you we go
21:57
through how to look at your schedule we
21:58
go through how to really break down
22:00
those projects and tasks you can see I
22:02
don't have my combo
22:04
behind me if you've been watching me for
22:05
a while in my old house you could always
22:07
see my calm on board it's on this wall
22:09
over here so I'm probably going to shift
22:11
where I'm recording because I know a lot
22:12
of you like to see the Kanban board and
22:14
the process the progress that I have
22:16
throughout the year but for now it's
22:18
just easier to record with my desktop
22:20
computer so hopefully the Kanban board
22:23
will make a reappearance but at the end
22:26

[Music]

hello everyone I am back today with the
0:02
great video since I'm finishing up a
0:05
book like as we speak
0:07
y'all this is deadline hair I apologize
0:10
you're just gonna have to forgive me but
0:12
this was my only chance to do this video
0:13
and to get the voiceover done but I'm
0:16
gonna show you since I'm on deadline now
0:18
and I'm gonna be starting a new books
0:19
coming up this next weekend I thought it
0:22
would be a great time to show you how I
0:24
have planned my writing schedule to stay
0:26
on track and I also have a free download
0:28
for you guys at the end of this so stay
0:30
tuned guys now I am gonna show you how I
0:37
actually like plan out when my release
0:40
date is gonna be and how I'm gonna get
0:41
through everything so I'm gonna be using
0:43
just a little bit of washi tape some
0:46
recollections dual brush pin which is
0:48
very similar to the tombos and then this
0:51
is a SEPA pen I got them from Amazon
0:54
they're just felt to fineliners and I
0:56
love them and they're very cheap so
0:58
they're great and then I've been using
1:00
this happy planner like hardcover which
1:03
I'm not using like a planner insert I've
1:06
really actually been getting into making
1:08
my own planner pages that I'm just
1:10
showing you real quick here if you guys
1:11
want to see a video of the planner pages
1:14
that I've made for myself to help
1:15
organize my business let me know
1:18
and I can do a video on those I'm still
1:20
using the hobo Nicci but I'm also using
1:22
these to help organize my tasks so this
1:25
page that I've got right here is
1:27
actually my writing plan page and I'm of
1:33
course if you know me I am just putting
1:35
a little bit of washi tape on there to
1:37
make it look a little bit prettier and
1:39
right now I'm just trying to find like a
1:41
prettier place to put it because this is
1:43
actually like I've been using the system
1:46
but I didn't have like a printed page to
1:49
use so I made one to start using as I'm
1:52
getting more into this year because I've
1:54
been writing more books this year then I
1:57
have in a very long time so it's just
2:00
super important for me to stay on track
2:02
to look forward and instead of just
2:04
being like it takes as long as it takes
2:06
to actually plan ahead and have a goal I
2:11
am really somebody who needs like I'm a
2:15
super procrastinator let's just put it
2:16
that way and I'm somebody who needs the
2:19
guidance of a deadline so this helps me
2:22
a lot so at the top here I have a space
2:24
to put the title of the book which the
2:27
one I'm about to start is deceiving
2:28
darkness which is my shadow demon Saga
2:30
book ten then there's a place to put
2:33
your word count goal and for this book
2:35
it's nine ninety thousand words and then
2:37
my words per day goal which means how
2:40
many words per day do I plan to write on
2:42
the days that I'm writing which I have
2:44
put for this book four thousand words
2:46
per day which means that it should take
2:48
me 23 days of writing to hit that goal
2:52
then I've got places here that have all
2:54
the dates and I've got up space for the
2:56
goal date and a space for the actual so
2:59
the first thing on there is the day that
3:01
I'm starting which is June 25th so
3:04
here's what else I do I go in and I
3:07
print out a Google Calendar I'm going to
3:09
show you real quick how I do that okay
3:11
so I'm just popping in a recording on my
3:14
screen real quick this is just basic
3:16
Google Calendar and you go to the little
3:19
settings bar on the right it looks like
3:22
a little cog and you can click print and
3:24
when you do that it brings up this print
3:27
dialog I like to click fit to page that
3:29
it all fits in one and then I just print
3:32
the month then I go back print again but
3:34
change the print range to the next month
3:37
I know that this is going to take me
3:39
through August so I'm printing out June
3:41
July and August calendars so I'd like to
3:45
click black-and-white so that it prints
3:47
in black-and-white and you'll see later
3:48
I had to go back and reprint these and I
3:51
forgot to click black-and-white but it's
3:52
not really a big deal just depends you
3:55
know what how much of your printer ink
3:57
you want to use so I just go in and
3:59
print you can change the dates and you
4:01
can print out any given month you do
4:03
have to go in and change the view to
4:05
month I think it automatically sets to
4:07
week so just go into that right corner
4:09
and click month and select the month
4:12
that you're interested in all right so
4:14
now back to the planner page so these
4:17
are the June this is the June planner
4:19
page that I have just the calendar page
4:21
and I print these out mostly for
4:24
planning purpose
4:25
I'm not gonna actually use them in a big
4:27
way when I actually start writing but
4:30
this is just to help me get a
4:32
big-picture view so if I'm starting on
4:34
June 25th then what that means for me is
4:37
I'm going to actually plot and outline
4:39
the book now this is book 10 in a series
4:41
so I already have a lot of notes on what
4:44
is going to happen in this so it's only
4:46
going to take me hopefully about a week
4:47
to get started on a rough plot and
4:50
outline so now I've moved on to July and
4:53
for that Sunday I'm marking that this is
4:56
the date I want to have the plot done so
4:58
what I do in this section here is I'm
5:02
writing down the start dates for things
5:05
and I'm running down when the deadlines
5:07
are which just gives me a rough estimate
5:09
of when things are going to get done so
5:11
the next thing is the rough draft that
5:14
needs to get done and like I said I'm
5:16
hoping for 4,000 words a day and what
5:18
I'm gonna do here is mark out any days
5:21
that I know I'm not gonna be writing
5:23
like I said that gives me about 23 days
5:26
on estimate that I need to be writing
5:30
four thousand words a day but I'm not
5:32
going to be writing every single day to
5:34
July 4th I marked off for the holiday
5:36
with family and then this entire week is
5:39
going to be lost to the rwa conference
5:42
so I went ahead and marked all of that
5:44
off I marked the day before and of the
5:46
day after I get home because I know I'm
5:48
gonna be packing and then I'm gonna need
5:49
to some time to like just rest when I
5:52
get home then I figured that following
5:55
Sunday I'm really gonna need an extra
5:56
day of rest there - July 11th is my
6:00
husband's birthday so I I might work a
6:02
little bit in the morning on that day
6:04
just depending on what he wants to do
6:05
but I'm not gonna count that in so this
6:07
is a crucial step if you're trying to
6:09
really estimate how much you're gonna
6:12
get done how quickly is you've got to
6:15
mark off the days that you're not going
6:16
to be writing and try to be realistic
6:18
about when you're writing and when
6:20
you're not writing because 23 days
6:23
sounds like whew I'm going to finish
6:24
this really fast but it doesn't mean 23
6:26
days from start to finish it means 23
6:29
writing days and there are going to be
6:31
some people who don't write on the
6:33
weekends and some people who only write
6:35
on the weekends some people only can
6:37
write
6:38
you know two or three hundred words a
6:39
day instead of thousand so you just sort
6:42
of figure out what it is you need and
6:44
how fast you can go what you feel
6:46
comfortable with and for me every book
6:48
is different four thousand words a day
6:50
is pretty realistic for the shadow demon
6:52
saga but a week to plot it may not be so
6:55
we'll have to just see so here I've
6:57
moved on to August and I've marked the
6:59
23 days and since it happens on the
7:02
weekend I decided to go ahead and get
7:03
myself 25 days before I set the deadline
7:06
because I might need a couple extra days
7:09
to finish out the rough draft so I'm
7:11
writing my rough draft deadline for
7:14
August 5th now I'm moving on to self
7:19
edits which is just my own editing pass
7:22
now I do edit some as I go so it only
7:25
takes me about 4 or 5 days usually
7:28
hopefully to go back and edit and I do
7:31
usually rewrite and add some things too
7:34
but I'm hoping that it will take about
7:35
five days for self edits and then I can
7:38
send it to my beta readers on that
7:40
Saturday then I know my beta readers
7:43
usually get back to me within a handful
7:45
of days so then I can send it to my
7:47
editor on the 15th which they should get
7:50
it back to me also in just a few days so
7:53
I'm hoping to have it back by Monday
7:54
where I can do my own final edits I do
7:57
submit you know I put in my beta
7:59
comments before I send it to the editor
8:01
make some changes then after the editor
8:03
sends it back I make more changes and
8:05
then do a final read-through which will
8:07
take a few days and then I'm hoping on
8:10
that following Friday
8:11
I'll have it formatted and ready to send
8:14
out to my arc team and usually I will
8:17
release on a Monday but it looks like
8:19
for this if there's any hope of getting
8:20
this book out in August it's gonna be
8:23
that last day of August because I like
8:25
to send out my arcs at least a week
8:27
ahead of time and I want to give myself
8:29
a little bit of leeway because I'm
8:31
really actually pushing pretty hard on
8:32
this one and to be honest I'm not going
8:35
to be surprised if it goes into
8:36
September instead of August but this is
8:39
kind of my best-case scenario so now
8:42
that I have all of those dates sort of
8:44
planned out I'm going to go back to my
8:47
writing plan page sorry for the shaking
8:49
there I think
8:50
hit it when I was changing the page
8:53
there and I'm going to you know add
8:57
those dates to this schedule so that I
8:59
can see it at a glance without having to
9:01
flip back and forth always so you'll see
9:04
me flip back and forth to find and
9:05
finalize the dates but you can see that
9:08
first one is the start date then the
9:10
plotting is completed by then the next
9:13
thing to fill in is the rough draft
9:14
rough draft deadline so I'd like to have
9:17
that done by August 5th then edits
9:21
completed by and by this I mean myself
9:23
edits not the editors edits but my edits
9:27
completed by so I put in that date and
9:29
then that I want to have it sent to the
9:32
beta's by the following day which is
9:34
August 11th and then send it to my
9:39
editor and any one of these things could
9:41
get disrupted by beta's taking longer to
9:44
get it in me being a week behind there's
9:46
any number of things that can happen so
9:49
it's good to keep in mind that this is
9:50
just kind of like a best-case scenario
9:51
gives me a you know a guideline to work
9:55
off of but I don't get too attached to
9:58
the outcome like I'm not going to be
9:59
like crying if I'm a week or two off
10:02
because you know life happens and
10:05
sometimes you can't force the words to
10:07
come and it would be great if they do
10:09
come but you know sometimes you need a
10:11
little bit of extra time for things to
10:13
flow and that's fine too I realized as I
10:15
was going through it I forgot to write
10:17
in my formatting date so I added that
10:19
back in and hope to have it formatted on
10:21
the 22nd and the arc sent out on the
10:23
24th and my target release day is August
10:28
31st so now I've got all that filled out
10:31
and when I go back and I'm actually
10:33
writing I will write in the actual date
10:36
like when I send it to Vedas I will
10:37
write the actual date that it got done
10:39
and then at the very end when the book
10:41
is done I will fill out this review
10:43
which is my final word count the total
10:45
production time and then just kind of a
10:48
review of how I felt while writing the
10:50
book what would I change about next time
10:52
like maybe give myself more plotting
10:53
time or plan for only a thousand words a
10:57
day and
10:57
additional notes that I might want to
10:59
keep track of so that is the planning
11:02
page that I use to help me stay on track
11:04
and hopefully get the book done on time
11:08
so there you have it
11:09
this is one of the main ways that I've
11:11
been able to stay on track I've been
11:13
writing so many more books than normal
11:16
like I think I've mentioned to you guys
11:17
before if you follow this channel that
11:19
usually I write two to three books a
11:21
year which is great that's a really nice
11:23
pace for me but over the last couple of
11:26
years I only wrote two books but I
11:27
started a bunch of series you guys have
11:29
heard this story before if you've been
11:31
following the channel and I'm really
11:33
really anxious to start a brand new
11:35
series in 2019 so my big big big goal
11:38
for this past year has been to quickly
11:40
finish up the series that I have ongoing
11:43
it's always a balancing act in terms of
11:46
making sure that I don't burn out that
11:48
I'm not reducing the quality of my work
11:50
but to be honest since we moved here to
11:53
Charleston and I've got this gorgeous
11:55
view of the marsh right behind my
11:57
desktop here and we can go to the beach
11:59
any afternoon and we do go quite a lot
12:01
it has really been really easy for me to
12:04
refill my well and get back to work and
12:06
I find that it's just been a really
12:09
inspirational time in my life so I'm
12:11
making the most of it and in order to
12:14
stay on track so that I don't
12:15
procrastinate more than I should
12:18
or get way behind kind of get an idea of
12:21
how far I'm gonna go
12:22
I created this writing plan sheet that I
12:24
just showed you and it's really been
12:26
helping me to stay on target and to know
12:29
kind of how long everything's going to
12:30
take now most of the time to be honest I
12:33
don't actually hit those targets exactly
12:36
it's just sort of a guideline for me to
12:39
see where I want to be and if it takes
12:42
me an extra couple of weeks or even a
12:44
month longer than I planned
12:45
that's fine especially if it's because
12:47
the plot isn't coming together or I just
12:49
need more time to think through it I am
12:51
totally willing to push that schedule to
12:54
the side to give it the time that it
12:55
needs however it's a really good way to
12:57
before I start the project to know
13:00
exactly how long it could take me in a
13:02
best-case scenario and if I get behind
13:05
how far behind am I I really hope this
13:07
is how
13:08
for you guys in planning your own work
13:10
and trying to figure out how long it
13:11
will take you and don't do any
13:13
comparisons please by saying oh gosh you
13:16
know it takes me six months to write a
13:17
rough draft or a year to write a rough
13:19
draft everybody has their own process
13:22
when I was first starting out it did
13:24
take me an entire year to write my first
13:26
book that when I scrapped and then it
13:28
took me an entire like year and a half
13:30
to write my second book and I also
13:31
scrapped that one for a long time and it
13:34
was only my like third completed novel
13:36
actually never mind fourth completed
13:38
novel that I published for the first
13:40
time in 2010 and I had been writing
13:42
steadily for three plus years at that
13:44
point it just after 25 books it starts
13:48
to get easier to know the plot and
13:49
especially because I'm on book 10 of a
13:51
series I already have a lot of this
13:53
plotted out and I already know so take
13:55
it with a grain of salt like what my
13:57
dates are use the process not comparing
14:00
anything to how fast I write if all you
14:03
can do is 500 words a day before you
14:05
start to feel burned out or no longer
14:06
inspired then do 500 words a day and set
14:09
that schedule up with that 500 words a
14:11
day mark out the days that you can't use
14:14
or you don't want to be writing like a
14:16
lot of people don't want to write on
14:17
Saturdays and Sundays other people who
14:19
have normal full-time jobs Monday
14:22
through Friday Saturday and Sunday are
14:23
the only days they write so take your
14:26
own schedule don't compare it to someone
14:27
else and make it work for you but
14:29
hopefully this will be a good guideline
14:31
for you and if you would like a copy of
14:33
my writing plan sheet you can get it
14:35

15:37
next video

hello everyone I am back today with the
0:02
great video since I'm finishing up a
0:05
book like as we speak
0:07
y'all this is deadline hair I apologize
0:10
you're just gonna have to forgive me but
0:12
this was my only chance to do this video
0:13
and to get the voiceover done but I'm
0:16
gonna show you since I'm on deadline now
0:18
and I'm gonna be starting a new books
0:19
coming up this next weekend I thought it
0:22
would be a great time to show you how I
0:24
have planned my writing schedule to stay
0:26
on track and I also have a free download
0:28
for you guys at the end of this so stay
0:30
tuned guys now I am gonna show you how I
0:37
actually like plan out when my release
0:40
date is gonna be and how I'm gonna get
0:41
through everything so I'm gonna be using
0:43
just a little bit of washi tape some
0:46
recollections dual brush pin which is
0:48
very similar to the tombos and then this
0:51
is a SEPA pen I got them from Amazon
0:54
they're just felt to fineliners and I
0:56
love them and they're very cheap so
0:58
they're great and then I've been using
1:00
this happy planner like hardcover which
1:03
I'm not using like a planner insert I've
1:06
really actually been getting into making
1:08
my own planner pages that I'm just
1:10
showing you real quick here if you guys
1:11
want to see a video of the planner pages
1:14
that I've made for myself to help
1:15
organize my business let me know
1:18
and I can do a video on those I'm still
1:20
using the hobo Nicci but I'm also using
1:22
these to help organize my tasks so this
1:25
page that I've got right here is
1:27
actually my writing plan page and I'm of
1:33
course if you know me I am just putting
1:35
a little bit of washi tape on there to
1:37
make it look a little bit prettier and
1:39
right now I'm just trying to find like a
1:41
prettier place to put it because this is
1:43
actually like I've been using the system
1:46
but I didn't have like a printed page to
1:49
use so I made one to start using as I'm
1:52
getting more into this year because I've
1:54
been writing more books this year then I
1:57
have in a very long time so it's just
2:00
super important for me to stay on track
2:02
to look forward and instead of just
2:04
being like it takes as long as it takes
2:06
to actually plan ahead and have a goal I
2:11
am really somebody who needs like I'm a
2:15
super procrastinator let's just put it
2:16
that way and I'm somebody who needs the
2:19
guidance of a deadline so this helps me
2:22
a lot so at the top here I have a space
2:24
to put the title of the book which the
2:27
one I'm about to start is deceiving
2:28
darkness which is my shadow demon Saga
2:30
book ten then there's a place to put
2:33
your word count goal and for this book
2:35
it's nine ninety thousand words and then
2:37
my words per day goal which means how
2:40
many words per day do I plan to write on
2:42
the days that I'm writing which I have
2:44
put for this book four thousand words
2:46
per day which means that it should take
2:48
me 23 days of writing to hit that goal
2:52
then I've got places here that have all
2:54
the dates and I've got up space for the
2:56
goal date and a space for the actual so
2:59
the first thing on there is the day that
3:01
I'm starting which is June 25th so
3:04
here's what else I do I go in and I
3:07
print out a Google Calendar I'm going to
3:09
show you real quick how I do that okay
3:11
so I'm just popping in a recording on my
3:14
screen real quick this is just basic
3:16
Google Calendar and you go to the little
3:19
settings bar on the right it looks like
3:22
a little cog and you can click print and
3:24
when you do that it brings up this print
3:27
dialog I like to click fit to page that
3:29
it all fits in one and then I just print
3:32
the month then I go back print again but
3:34
change the print range to the next month
3:37
I know that this is going to take me
3:39
through August so I'm printing out June
3:41
July and August calendars so I'd like to
3:45
click black-and-white so that it prints
3:47
in black-and-white and you'll see later
3:48
I had to go back and reprint these and I
3:51
forgot to click black-and-white but it's
3:52
not really a big deal just depends you
3:55
know what how much of your printer ink
3:57
you want to use so I just go in and
3:59
print you can change the dates and you
4:01
can print out any given month you do
4:03
have to go in and change the view to
4:05
month I think it automatically sets to
4:07
week so just go into that right corner
4:09
and click month and select the month
4:12
that you're interested in all right so
4:14
now back to the planner page so these
4:17
are the June this is the June planner
4:19
page that I have just the calendar page
4:21
and I print these out mostly for
4:24
planning purpose
4:25
I'm not gonna actually use them in a big
4:27
way when I actually start writing but
4:30
this is just to help me get a
4:32
big-picture view so if I'm starting on
4:34
June 25th then what that means for me is
4:37
I'm going to actually plot and outline
4:39
the book now this is book 10 in a series
4:41
so I already have a lot of notes on what
4:44
is going to happen in this so it's only
4:46
going to take me hopefully about a week
4:47
to get started on a rough plot and
4:50
outline so now I've moved on to July and
4:53
for that Sunday I'm marking that this is
4:56
the date I want to have the plot done so
4:58
what I do in this section here is I'm
5:02
writing down the start dates for things
5:05
and I'm running down when the deadlines
5:07
are which just gives me a rough estimate
5:09
of when things are going to get done so
5:11
the next thing is the rough draft that
5:14
needs to get done and like I said I'm
5:16
hoping for 4,000 words a day and what
5:18
I'm gonna do here is mark out any days
5:21
that I know I'm not gonna be writing
5:23
like I said that gives me about 23 days
5:26
on estimate that I need to be writing
5:30
four thousand words a day but I'm not
5:32
going to be writing every single day to
5:34
July 4th I marked off for the holiday
5:36
with family and then this entire week is
5:39
going to be lost to the rwa conference
5:42
so I went ahead and marked all of that
5:44
off I marked the day before and of the
5:46
day after I get home because I know I'm
5:48
gonna be packing and then I'm gonna need
5:49
to some time to like just rest when I
5:52
get home then I figured that following
5:55
Sunday I'm really gonna need an extra
5:56
day of rest there - July 11th is my
6:00
husband's birthday so I I might work a
6:02
little bit in the morning on that day
6:04
just depending on what he wants to do
6:05
but I'm not gonna count that in so this
6:07
is a crucial step if you're trying to
6:09
really estimate how much you're gonna
6:12
get done how quickly is you've got to
6:15
mark off the days that you're not going
6:16
to be writing and try to be realistic
6:18
about when you're writing and when
6:20
you're not writing because 23 days
6:23
sounds like whew I'm going to finish
6:24
this really fast but it doesn't mean 23
6:26
days from start to finish it means 23
6:29
writing days and there are going to be
6:31
some people who don't write on the
6:33
weekends and some people who only write
6:35
on the weekends some people only can
6:37
write
6:38
you know two or three hundred words a
6:39
day instead of thousand so you just sort
6:42
of figure out what it is you need and
6:44
how fast you can go what you feel
6:46
comfortable with and for me every book
6:48
is different four thousand words a day
6:50
is pretty realistic for the shadow demon
6:52
saga but a week to plot it may not be so
6:55
we'll have to just see so here I've
6:57
moved on to August and I've marked the
6:59
23 days and since it happens on the
7:02
weekend I decided to go ahead and get
7:03
myself 25 days before I set the deadline
7:06
because I might need a couple extra days
7:09
to finish out the rough draft so I'm
7:11
writing my rough draft deadline for
7:14
August 5th now I'm moving on to self
7:19
edits which is just my own editing pass
7:22
now I do edit some as I go so it only
7:25
takes me about 4 or 5 days usually
7:28
hopefully to go back and edit and I do
7:31
usually rewrite and add some things too
7:34
but I'm hoping that it will take about
7:35
five days for self edits and then I can
7:38
send it to my beta readers on that
7:40
Saturday then I know my beta readers
7:43
usually get back to me within a handful
7:45
of days so then I can send it to my
7:47
editor on the 15th which they should get
7:50
it back to me also in just a few days so
7:53
I'm hoping to have it back by Monday
7:54
where I can do my own final edits I do
7:57
submit you know I put in my beta
7:59
comments before I send it to the editor
8:01
make some changes then after the editor
8:03
sends it back I make more changes and
8:05
then do a final read-through which will
8:07
take a few days and then I'm hoping on
8:10
that following Friday
8:11
I'll have it formatted and ready to send
8:14
out to my arc team and usually I will
8:17
release on a Monday but it looks like
8:19
for this if there's any hope of getting
8:20
this book out in August it's gonna be
8:23
that last day of August because I like
8:25
to send out my arcs at least a week
8:27
ahead of time and I want to give myself
8:29
a little bit of leeway because I'm
8:31
really actually pushing pretty hard on
8:32
this one and to be honest I'm not going
8:35
to be surprised if it goes into
8:36
September instead of August but this is
8:39
kind of my best-case scenario so now
8:42
that I have all of those dates sort of
8:44
planned out I'm going to go back to my
8:47
writing plan page sorry for the shaking
8:49
there I think
8:50
hit it when I was changing the page
8:53
there and I'm going to you know add
8:57
those dates to this schedule so that I
8:59
can see it at a glance without having to
9:01
flip back and forth always so you'll see
9:04
me flip back and forth to find and
9:05
finalize the dates but you can see that
9:08
first one is the start date then the
9:10
plotting is completed by then the next
9:13
thing to fill in is the rough draft
9:14
rough draft deadline so I'd like to have
9:17
that done by August 5th then edits
9:21
completed by and by this I mean myself
9:23
edits not the editors edits but my edits
9:27
completed by so I put in that date and
9:29
then that I want to have it sent to the
9:32
beta's by the following day which is
9:34
August 11th and then send it to my
9:39
editor and any one of these things could
9:41
get disrupted by beta's taking longer to
9:44
get it in me being a week behind there's
9:46
any number of things that can happen so
9:49
it's good to keep in mind that this is
9:50
just kind of like a best-case scenario
9:51
gives me a you know a guideline to work
9:55
off of but I don't get too attached to
9:58
the outcome like I'm not going to be
9:59
like crying if I'm a week or two off
10:02
because you know life happens and
10:05
sometimes you can't force the words to
10:07
come and it would be great if they do
10:09
come but you know sometimes you need a
10:11
little bit of extra time for things to
10:13
flow and that's fine too I realized as I
10:15
was going through it I forgot to write
10:17
in my formatting date so I added that
10:19
back in and hope to have it formatted on
10:21
the 22nd and the arc sent out on the
10:23
24th and my target release day is August
10:28
31st so now I've got all that filled out
10:31
and when I go back and I'm actually
10:33
writing I will write in the actual date
10:36
like when I send it to Vedas I will
10:37
write the actual date that it got done
10:39
and then at the very end when the book
10:41
is done I will fill out this review
10:43
which is my final word count the total
10:45
production time and then just kind of a
10:48
review of how I felt while writing the
10:50
book what would I change about next time
10:52
like maybe give myself more plotting
10:53
time or plan for only a thousand words a
10:57
day and
10:57
additional notes that I might want to
10:59
keep track of so that is the planning
11:02
page that I use to help me stay on track
11:04
and hopefully get the book done on time
11:08
so there you have it
11:09
this is one of the main ways that I've
11:11
been able to stay on track I've been
11:13
writing so many more books than normal
11:16
like I think I've mentioned to you guys
11:17
before if you follow this channel that
11:19
usually I write two to three books a
11:21
year which is great that's a really nice
11:23
pace for me but over the last couple of
11:26
years I only wrote two books but I
11:27
started a bunch of series you guys have
11:29
heard this story before if you've been
11:31
following the channel and I'm really
11:33
really anxious to start a brand new
11:35
series in 2019 so my big big big goal
11:38
for this past year has been to quickly
11:40
finish up the series that I have ongoing
11:43
it's always a balancing act in terms of
11:46
making sure that I don't burn out that
11:48
I'm not reducing the quality of my work
11:50
but to be honest since we moved here to
11:53
Charleston and I've got this gorgeous
11:55
view of the marsh right behind my
11:57
desktop here and we can go to the beach
11:59
any afternoon and we do go quite a lot
12:01
it has really been really easy for me to
12:04
refill my well and get back to work and
12:06
I find that it's just been a really
12:09
inspirational time in my life so I'm
12:11
making the most of it and in order to
12:14
stay on track so that I don't
12:15
procrastinate more than I should
12:18
or get way behind kind of get an idea of
12:21
how far I'm gonna go
12:22
I created this writing plan sheet that I
12:24
just showed you and it's really been
12:26
helping me to stay on target and to know
12:29
kind of how long everything's going to
12:30
take now most of the time to be honest I
12:33
don't actually hit those targets exactly
12:36
it's just sort of a guideline for me to
12:39
see where I want to be and if it takes
12:42
me an extra couple of weeks or even a
12:44
month longer than I planned
12:45
that's fine especially if it's because
12:47
the plot isn't coming together or I just
12:49
need more time to think through it I am
12:51
totally willing to push that schedule to
12:54
the side to give it the time that it
12:55
needs however it's a really good way to
12:57
before I start the project to know
13:00
exactly how long it could take me in a
13:02
best-case scenario and if I get behind
13:05
how far behind am I I really hope this
13:07
is how
13:08
for you guys in planning your own work
13:10
and trying to figure out how long it
13:11
will take you and don't do any
13:13
comparisons please by saying oh gosh you
13:16
know it takes me six months to write a
13:17
rough draft or a year to write a rough
13:19
draft everybody has their own process
13:22
when I was first starting out it did
13:24
take me an entire year to write my first
13:26
book that when I scrapped and then it
13:28
took me an entire like year and a half
13:30
to write my second book and I also
13:31
scrapped that one for a long time and it
13:34
was only my like third completed novel
13:36
actually never mind fourth completed
13:38
novel that I published for the first
13:40
time in 2010 and I had been writing
13:42
steadily for three plus years at that
13:44
point it just after 25 books it starts
13:48
to get easier to know the plot and
13:49
especially because I'm on book 10 of a
13:51
series I already have a lot of this
13:53
plotted out and I already know so take
13:55
it with a grain of salt like what my
13:57
dates are use the process not comparing
14:00
anything to how fast I write if all you
14:03
can do is 500 words a day before you
14:05
start to feel burned out or no longer
14:06
inspired then do 500 words a day and set
14:09
that schedule up with that 500 words a
14:11
day mark out the days that you can't use
14:14
or you don't want to be writing like a
14:16
lot of people don't want to write on
14:17
Saturdays and Sundays other people who
14:19
have normal full-time jobs Monday
14:22
through Friday Saturday and Sunday are
14:23
the only days they write so take your
14:26
own schedule don't compare it to someone
14:27
else and make it work for you but
14:29
hopefully this will be a good guideline
14:31
for you and if you would like a copy of
14:33
my writing plan sheet you can get it

Who Needs A Series Bible
1:18
first we're going to talk about who needs a series bible and why do you need one this is pretty self-explanatory but
1:26
there is a lot of area covered here in terms of how complex your series bible needs to be
1:33
if you are writing a series of books particularly a series of fiction
1:38
books you need a series bible it can be something as simple as a sheet
1:44
of paper or a small notebook or a simple google doc if you are not
1:49
writing something super complex and there's not a lot of moving pieces in your series or a lot of books in your
1:55
series so for example if you're just writing a three book series and you're going to be
2:00
writing it very quickly so you're not going to have a lot of information to track and it could be a pretty
2:05
simple like one pager type series bible but i find that if you're writing a
2:12
longer complex series where you've got a lot of different cases or 10 different books to track or you
2:19
have a lot of different characters you need a series bible and it needs to be super
2:24
organized now every person is going to be different in terms of how much they want
2:29
to put into their series bible and how much they want to track but there are a few things that are
2:35
super important to keep in mind for when you're creating your series bible so we're going to go over those
2:40
but long story short if you are writing a series you need some kind of way to track the
2:47
facts of your series because as you're creating your world there are lots of
2:52
things that are going to change and shift and you'll keep it in your mind that like oh yeah i'm pretty sure
2:57
she had two brothers or two sisters and when you actually go to edit that novel
3:03
maybe you cut that brother and you forgot about it and now this character only has one
3:09
sister and you go you finish you publish the book and then maybe you're working on
3:14
multiple things or maybe you had a baby or maybe things are happening in your life and it takes you six months to get
3:19
back to write book two well if you don't have some kind of document that says here's the facts of
3:26
the book here are the things that actually went into the novel or the previous five novels these are the
3:32
story canon then your mind is potentially going to get all jumped jumbled up with the things you were
3:39
brainstorming the things you put in the story and cut out it happens all the time and in fact my
3:44
husband who is someone who is my first reader and he reads pretty much everything i write but
3:50
we also brainstorm a lot of things years down the road since i've been working on my shadow demon saga for 10
3:55
years he'll be like well didn't jackson do such and such and i'll be like no not in the actual books we talked
4:02
about him doing that but it never actually made it into the books so as writers we have a
4:07
lot of potential story lines and things in our minds so it's important to
4:12
actually keep some kind of record of what the truth of the story is
4:17
what are the facts what actually got published in the books because it's too difficult there's too much to
4:24
keep track of to just expect yourself to remember every tiny little detail
4:29
if your characters go into a diner in book one that has blue seats with a red stripe in
4:35
it you know when that character goes back and revisits that diner three books from
4:40
now and three years from now when you're writing it in your head you might be able to convince yourself that it was a black
4:46
seat with a red stripe and you'll just write it that way and if you don't have some way of tracking or
4:52
checking in on yourself then you're going to have a lot of inconsistencies because you'll just write those diner
4:58
chairs in as black with a red stripe now maybe that kind of thing doesn't matter that much to the story
5:04
but it is actually important to your story world that things stay consistent i know i personally have
5:11
made way too many consistency errors with like simple things like eye color or
5:17
not remembering that i mentioned something in a book previously because as i was first getting started i
5:23
did not have a good series bible and so this is something that i really take seriously now because
5:30
it's something that it takes too much time to go back and re-read 10
5:36
books or a million words worth of story world when all you really need is a document
5:42
and it does take time and it is complex if you have a big story world but it's very important and it can be
5:49
super helpful and save you a ton of time in the long run especially if you're writing a big complex series now when it comes to
How To Create A Series Bible
5:57
methods of creating a series bible this is going to be as varied as the number of writers that are out there
6:02
everybody has their own system or their own way of tracking stuff but what i'm going to do is i'm going to give you some examples of
6:09
series bibles that are out there and i'm going to tell you what i think is most important when it comes to an
6:14
effective series bible so one of the most effective things or one of the most important
6:21
things about a series bible is that it becomes easy to search so whether you're doing
6:26
it in a binder or on a web page or in some kind of software or program it needs to be searchable so
6:34
if you're doing it on paper have tabs or have some kind of color-coded system or dashboards or something to where you
6:41
can easily say well here's the section where i talk about characters or here's the section where i cover all
6:46
the different places in my world so that when you're writing and you have that story question about what
6:51
color were the seats in that diner you can just easily go to that tab turn
6:56
and find the section i started out in a binder like that where i was trying to organize
7:03
all of my things and hand write them and washi tape and make them pretty and you guys
7:08
know if you've been following me for any period of time that i am a paper product kind of person i mean you can
7:14
just see it all around me i love to keep track of things in on paper but when it comes to a series bible this
7:21
is something i demand of myself that i do digitally because it is so
7:26
much easier to just go into a webpage that has a little search box and say diner and then it pulls up every
7:34
instance in your series bible where you have mentioned that there was a diner and it can be very easy to see and find
7:42
what you need and when it comes to doing the like nitty gritty work of researching consistency in your story
7:48
and making sure your facts are straight having that search box where you can just go in and it pulls up every
7:54
instance is magical and i highly recommend doing it digitally but you don't have to
8:00
just make sure that your system is searchable in some way and it has an organization to it another important
8:08
thing that you want to think about when you're creating your series bible and deciding how to create it is you need to make sure that it's easy
8:14
to access so if it's a giant binder that or like a series of binders that might
8:19
be something that's difficult to take with you when you go on a writing retreat or when you move and hey truthfully not to be down on
8:28
paper planning because i know a lot of people use series bibles in binders but it's also
8:33
easy to lose something like that i mean i have moved several times in the last couple years we're gonna move again this year
8:40
if i had to keep track of that one series bible or a series of binders
8:45
i would be a nervous wreck because that's a lot of pressure to put that much time into
8:50
something that can be lost either just because you misplaced it or i have been through two total loss house
8:56
fires and i have lost enough stuff that way to be devastated if i lose it so another
9:02
thing to think about but it needs to be something that's easy to carry around with you if you go riding out places or that's
9:08
easily accessible to you wherever you are for this reason i like to use a
9:15
web-based type of tracking system so i personally use a private wiki and i'll talk more
9:22
about this in just a minute but one of the things i love about the private wiki is that it's accessible not
9:27
only to me but also to my beta readers or to anybody that i want to
9:32
you know to give my login to so it's just a simple thing as long as i can pull up a web page i can pull up my
9:40
series bible the cons to that of course are that everything is easily accessible so if someone were to get a hold of your
9:46
logins there would be all of your story information including potentially like future story lines
9:52
right there for people to see so if you are someone who is nervous about that kind of thing and
9:59
having it too accessible you might not want to do a web page based series bible it's totally going to
10:05
depend on your comfort level and in a similar note there it's just it would be great if it was something that
Different Methods
10:10
was difficult to lose um so that's one of the reasons that i like writing in google docs or using a
10:16
private wiki is because it's if my computer dies i'm not going to lose all of my wiki stuff it needs to be
10:23
something that can be easily backed up or photocopied or whatever it is but try to have some kind of redundant copy
10:30
or to be keeping it in a place where it's not going to be easily lost because you don't want to put years of work into a series bible and
10:37
then have something happen like a glitch on your computer and your whole bible is gone so let's talk about the
10:43
different methods and like i said there are probably a lot more methods even than what i'm going to cover here
10:49
so feel free to share a different methods that you've used in the comments one that we've talked about of course
10:54
is a notebook or binder system so i know there are many authors out there and this is how i
10:59
started out is with a binder system when you do this you just need to kind of decide what your organization system
11:07
is going to be so that you can make it as easily searchable as possible if it just ends up being a bunch of
11:13
paper stuffed in a binder it's going to be very difficult to find the information and the facts you're
11:18
looking for and you might as well not have a series bible anyway so if you are going to make one
11:24
that is on paper just make sure that it's easily searchable and very well organized there are a
11:31
couple other authortubers and friends of mine that have videos up here on youtube about how they are creating their series
11:37
bible in a binder so i'm going to link some of those down below for you as well i personally moved on from using a binder
11:44
system to using a private wiki now a wiki if you think of it as like
11:50
wikipedia right so this is basically a web-based thing i don't even know it's a web-based
11:56
wiki i don't know what else to call it's not software but it's just a web-based organization system of files and what i love so much
12:03
about using a wiki is the fact that it is super super easy to set up you just basically go in and
12:10
you can create a page for everything you need and it's super easy to cross reference
12:16
and link between pages so i talked about this on my previous video
12:21
so i won't go into it too much here but one of the things that i love the most so let's say i want to create one page
12:27
in my wiki for every character that appears in my story i can actually create a folder
12:32
called characters inside a wiki then i can have a page dedicated to each
12:39
character in my story on that page i can keep track of everything we know
12:45
about that character their appearance their backstory any like common knowledge about them any
12:51
phrases they often use their weapons their magic system their relationships and all of those
12:56
kinds of things that are important to know about those characters but one of the other things that i can do is if i have a similar folder
13:04
that's all about the places in this world so the shops the towns the countries the fantasy
13:10
worlds the castles every little place has its own page as well what i can do
13:16
is i can say you know harper lives in the town of peachville and is sent to live in a
13:22
place called shadowford home for girls well when i write that out on the page i
13:27
can actually link the words shatterford home for girls back to the actual page in
13:35
the places folder that talks about that home for girls so it becomes this
13:40
basically like spider web of information that makes things super easy to research
13:46
when i'm going through and doing my research and due diligence to make sure things are consistent
13:51
because i can be like oh she went to this place and i can just click on that place and it takes me to a whole page
13:57
where i'm talking about that place and all the details and then inside that place it can be like and there's a
14:03
waitress here whose name is gina and she works at this diner then i can click on
14:09
the diner or the name of the person and i can read all about her history with that diner and i love that sort of interlocking
14:16
linking system and that cross reference system because it is there's just no other system out there like it
14:22
and it's brilliant and it helps so much another thing i love about wikis like i was mentioning earlier is that it's
14:29
super easy to search once you have all of those pages set up and all of those folders set up inside
14:35
your wiki there's a little search box at least in the one that i use at pbworks.com i will
14:40
have it linked down below for you um there's a search box at the top and you can search for diner or you can
14:46
search for shadowford home for girls and it will pull up every single instance just like it does
14:52
when you search google it will pull up every time i have written the word shadowford home for
14:57
girls inside that wiki so i can see all the instances of that phrase
15:03
and i can easily choose and search to see and that search function is just really
15:08
hard to be because it makes it so easy i don't even have to know where that information is located in my folder
15:15
system because i've got a search and i can search for those keywords and terms and it pulls it right up it saves me
15:22
hours of time i also just love the way that you can arrange things in folders and pages
Pros
15:28
the organization system of a wiki is really flexible i love it i will also just throw in here
15:34
too that another really good pro for using a wiki is that it can make
15:40
things collaborative similar to why i love google docs which i've talked about before on this channel
15:45
you can collaborate with other people so if you're writing a series with multiple other authors you can all have your series bible and
15:52
all of your information on that wiki we did this with my willow harbor group when we created that series
15:59
all of the facts of the series were right there so i didn't have to go back through juliana's series to see
16:04
what her details were because all of her series information and the shops and the recurring characters were
16:11
inside the wiki and it made it so much easier plus there was a map to reference and all these other things
16:17
another thing that you can do later too is if you want to make sure that your book is being edited
16:24
for consistency is you can have a beta reader go through and search your wiki
16:30
against the facts in your next book so if i'm putting out book 11 in my shadow name and saga i could actually tag one
16:35
of my beta readers and say hey i'm gonna give you my login to the wiki and every time you see a fact like
16:41
somebody's hair color or the color of the seats or this type of necklace or this object
16:46
that you've seen before just go in search make sure that it's the right color or the right fact you
16:52
can pay them to do that or ask them to volunteer to do it but it might be a good way to just make sure things are consistent
16:57
and it gives you that collaborative opportunity beyond that pretty much any place that you can store
17:04
a bunch of information you can create a wiki inside of so here are just a few examples of
17:10
places or software you could use to create a wiki so one note microsoft's onenote is
17:16
something i know a lot of people use to create their wikis because you can also do color coding and folders and different
17:21
things like that i am not familiar with it so i'm not going to give you a tutorial but i'll just let you know that if you go
17:27
searching you can probably find some examples of people using onenote evernote is another thing that
17:33
is commonly used for series wikis or series bibles so evernote might be something you would
17:39
look like to look into i have heard many people say that they use scrivener so if you're not familiar
17:45
with scrivener it is a writing software and it is something you actually download onto your computer
17:51
and you can use it for your writing but a lot of people will also use scrivener documents for their series
17:58
bible and they'll put images in and track their story arcs and everything else so if you have scrivener you can use that
18:05
for your story bible or your series bible you could just do something simple that you already have access to
18:11
like using google docs you could also use word the capabilities of google docs or words
18:18
to actually interact with each other and do that cross cross page linking though is not going
18:24
to be there so just keep that in mind when you create a google doc it will be searchable but it might be a
18:30
lot of information to be keeping in one doc so if you have like a folder worth of documents
18:35
they won't be able to talk to each other the same way a wiki can so just some pros and cons there as well
18:41
a couple other tools that you might want to look into that seem really neat online is world anvil is one this is a site
18:49
that i believe was actually put together for campaigns for like d d type campaigns so gaming like tabletop
18:56
gaming and things like that where people could set up their characters and the rules of the land and the campaigns and
19:02
all these things but i have a friend who uses world anvil for all of his fantasy stuff and it became a
19:09
great place where you can keep track of your maps and your characters and what the races and creatures that you
19:15
might come upon so if you're writing a big fantasy world you might want to check out worldanville.com and i will link that
19:21
for you down below it's also in your how to plan and write a series workbook from
19:27
the previous video another site that i stumbled upon that i saw some people using for a
19:33
series bible type thing but also seems to have a lot of plotting tools inside is a website called hive word and in
19:40
hive word you can track basically the story arcs and the plots of your books and then just kind of plug
19:46
and play i again have not spent any time really like diving into this but i will leave a link
19:52
for you down below if you're interested in kind of looking at another web-based story type tracker that's out
19:58
there but like i said basically anywhere you can store information be it a binder or
20:04
something physical be it a folder in a google drive or even just word or something like that you can
20:10
use for a series bible but before you really spend a lot of time and let me tell you i've spent hours and actually thousands of
20:17
dollars putting my wiki together because i paid someone else to create some wiki pages for me you want
20:22
to make sure that you put some thought into what method you're going to use before you invest
20:28
that many hours in it because it's not going to be easy to take a binder and make it into a wiki it's going to be
20:34
like starting from scratch so before you start really put thought into how you want to do it and how you want to use it
20:41
so that you make sure you're creating your series bible in the most helpful place for your individual
20:46
needs okay so next we're going to talk about what to track in your series bible so like i
20:52
said in the beginning of this video what you're going to track in your series bible is the facts of your world
20:59
as a surprise bonus for you guys today if you are on my mailing list or if you join my mailing list there's a link for you
21:05
to join down below i have put a new uh reference tracking sheet in the hb resource library that is
21:13
basically just a list of all these things that you can and should track in your series bible and we're
21:19
gonna go to it now and talk about all those things that you can track let's take a look at another free
Series Bible Checklist
21:25
download that i have for you guys if you are on my mailing list this will already be in
21:30
the hp resource library if you have not yet joined my mailing list you can sign up
21:36
for it through the link down below i'll have a link to today's blog post where you can go and sign up for it
21:42
and i will send you this series bible checklist as well as last week's how to plan and write your series workbook
21:48
and a bunch of other resources how to plot a novel how to edit a novel i have a lot of resources and i keep adding to
21:54
it so go sign up for that list come join us in the community and let's go through this it is not
22:01
meant to be completely exhaustive so there may be other things for your personal story world that you want to
22:07
track but there also may be a lot of things on here that you think okay
22:12
i don't need to track that that's way too detailed so really this is a personal system you need to make some decisions
22:19
about what your story world is going to depend on so just think about your own process and as you finish
22:26
your first book in the series what when you go back to write book two
22:31
what is going to be important to you what are you going to need to reference and if you're thinking about potentially
22:37
writing a really long series what ten books from now are you going to need to remember about
22:42
books one and two so give that some thought before you start because it's a lot harder to go back
22:49
once you hit book five and start tracking characters that you didn't track in the first place it's so
22:54
much easier if you do this as you go so really put some thought into what you're going to track so i'm
22:59
hoping this checklist will help you so one of the first and most important things to track is
23:04
characters and this can be every single recurring character in your book including the side characters so in your series bible
23:11
lists things like hair and eye color their height so anything they wear typically or how they
23:17
look any distinguishing marks tattoos features commonly used phrases and when we're
23:23
talking about commonly used phrases this could be things that your character uses themselves like they're always saying
23:30
gotcha or whatever or it could be something that is commonly said about your
23:35
character so for example in the wheel of time there's always kind of a funny thing that
23:40
happens between matt and perrin always think thinking that rand is good with the girls or
23:46
rand always saying that parents good with the girls and it's just kind of a funny back and forth thing um or it could be something that
23:53
everybody thinks this character is intelligent or everybody thinks this character is sly or slimy or oily or whatever but any
24:00
commonly used phrases about your character or by the character and this can go for features like things that people notice
24:07
first about your character or things that people um commonly associate with your character like he
24:13
always has a certain type of expression on his face so these are types of things that are important to track you can also track their
24:20
relationships their skills their backstory personality inner and outer
24:25
desires like their passions their personal character arc for each book and we'll go into this
24:31
in a template towards the end of this workbook and don't forget to track your villains too
24:36
so you can get as detailed as you want in terms of how many characters you could track every single character that ever
24:43
appears in the book or you could only track the ones that recur the most often it's up to you but it can be a good idea
24:50
to add your villains in there too another thing to track is your story arc
24:55
and book summaries so i like to create an overall page or section in my series
25:01
bible for every single book in the series and the story world so on this page for example you might
25:08
include a full summary of the book and you can have the main arc the subplots
25:13
any story threads that are advanced the character arcs that occur in this book that are important the villains
25:19
the relationship to the overall series arc how many words that book has the book
25:25
cover any keywords you used when you published it you could even include links to that book at the various
25:30
vendors you could include any type of like blurb that you use or add copy that
25:37
you've tried you can get as detailed as you want here depending on how you want to use your series bible i love to have that
25:43
overview page for every single book so that when i'm getting ready and preparing to write the next book in the
25:49
series i can just briefly run through you know all previous six books and they're just getting a
25:54
refresher of their character arcs their main story arcs the villains the twists the turns and things that happened
26:00
which is so much faster than going back and reading all six books it gives you that good
26:06
overview if you decide to use a color coding system for your stories this is also a place where you can include that
26:12
key places and the setting of your story is also super important so this can be like i say here
26:18
as broad as a section for the entire world like the continents or you know the cosmere if you're looking
26:25
at brandon sanderson's stuff or in my case the shadow world so i could have a distinction for the shadow
26:31
world versus the human world and then i could get as detailed and specific as
26:37
peachville the town and then also have a page for the clearing in the woods outside of
26:42
shadowford so you can get as detailed as you want and go as my new as you want depending
26:49
on what types of locations or settings recur often in your story anything that comes up should be noted
26:57
including the description any identifying terrain or landmarks you can even make notes here about the culture
27:03
of a place any type of commonly seen weather businesses and buildings
27:08
so i go so here i say if you mention the trim color on the heroine's house put it in
27:14
your series bible because these are simple things that could come up when it comes to consistency later
27:21
however this is one of those places when you're talking about plaque tracking things where you could go a little bit
27:27
too crazy so if you're writing a romance series for example and you mention a lot of things about the heroine's house but
27:33
you might never revisit that heroine's house because the next book is going to be about a different heroine
27:39
it might not be worth your time to go through and create a detailed series bible page
27:45
for the heroine's house because you're going to only reference it briefly if at all in the rest of the series
27:51
however if you're writing a family saga and the estate that they live on is
27:57
something that comes up in every single book you're going to want to make detailed notes on where the rooms are
28:02
what the style of the house is what happens in each room what types of things are mentioned in each room
28:08
so really just put some thought into how often these things are going to be mentioned in future books because your
28:13
series bible should primarily be a reference material for you as you're
28:19
writing subsequent books put some good thought into what you'll need to track and do your best to balance the time you
28:26
spend creating your series bible against the time it would take you to research this later
28:32
this is also a good section to include any maps even if you're just creating a rough sketch of
28:37
the inside of the house or the floor plan or the the terrain of the country that they're
28:43
in that sort of thing another thing you might want to track is organizations culture and the government in your town or your
28:50
world how much of this you track is going to depend heavily on the type of series
28:56
so if you're writing a small town romance you might not have any organizations that are important like
29:01
shadowy organizations and the government might not be that important because it's just the same real world style of
29:07
government that we have now however if you're writing a romance series the culture
29:12
might be something that you want to mention maybe the entire series is set inside a business and the culture of
29:20
that business is very important or maybe you're writing a southern small town romance where the culture
29:26
in terms of the events that they have or the types of organizations that they have are a
29:33
reflection of the culture of that town so that culture is going to be very different than
29:39
a book set in chicago in 1920 so you're going to want to track some of
29:44
that if it keeps coming up so this can be things like any ruling or
29:49
mysterious organizations this could be the rules or laws in your world
29:55
the culture the fashion any attitude of the ruling government or the attitude or general music and
30:01
culture of the times just think about the hunger games so think of if she had not tracked how the
30:07
world works the way the government is set up the culture of each district she would have had to go back to book
30:12
one so many times checking to see what she had written originally so this can be something important to
30:18
your series another important thing to track is magic systems and technology so with all magic
30:25
systems there are rules right there's consequences to using it flaws or
30:30
dangers maybe you have to use certain words to cast your magic when it comes to technology
30:36
maybe there are certain things that are governing the ships or the types of
30:41
weapons that are used or you know think about the matrix what is going on with that story world
30:47
and how the machines are using humans as sort of batteries so what's really happening here in your
30:53
world be as detailed as you feel you need to be so this could be referencing any tools that are used
30:59
words important books ways of gaining knowledge just basically how does your world work
Tracking Objects
31:05
consider tracking any objects of significance this can be an array of things and again
31:11
you don't have to go through your books and like pull out every single object that's ever mentioned however if there's
31:17
certain things that keep recurring or coming up like think about in the marvel series marvel universe the tesseract
31:25
how many times do we see the tesseract and how many times does it show up and play a role in the story
31:31
so many times so if nobody was tracking that then you might have lost track of who's
31:36
supposed to have it in your timeline and that sort of thing so these are important things to track as well
31:42
so this could be as detailed as a car or a certain box that's used some kind
31:47
of totem or a book like a spell book that's used so you can add these to the timeline
31:53
they can have just a quick note or an entire page but if you're going to reference it or it's going to recur in
31:58
your story i would recommend tracking it and your tracking page could include an image in terms of what you think this
32:06
item looks like another thing you might want to track is the language or dialect so this can be something you can
32:13
just track on each individual characters page or on the culture page of your town but it
32:18
could also be something that you have your own page to discuss the language or dialect
32:24
you can also track separate timelines this can be as detailed as you want it
32:29
to be but it should be something that you track at least on a superficial level
32:34
even with a series that seems to be pretty sequential one you know or chronological it can
32:40
still be important to track timelines this can be something that you want to keep track of in terms of
32:45
villains or your character's backstory even if you're writing what seems like a contemporary world
32:52
not super complicated story it can be important to track the timelines of
32:57
when characters meet each other for the first time or when someone got married versus when someone else met
33:03
their you know future spouse these things can all be important to know like this happened two
33:09
years ago or this person left town five years ago and i would love to keep this
33:14
on an actual like chronological timeline this can take the form of a simple list
33:20
or it can be extremely detailed with like an entire history of your story world so
33:26
make your series bible work for your own personal story needs finally i highly recommend keeping
33:32
a style guide in your series bible so a style guide is basically a set of standards for how you
33:38
style the text of your story so this can mean the way that you capitalize
33:43
certain organizations or the names of towns it can mean how you use italics or it
33:50
can mean how do you delineate the difference between a dream sequence or a text
33:55
messaging sequence whatever you're using in your story it's a good idea to create a style
34:00
guide for how you do this now i have seen style guides include things about characters too
34:06
so your style guide might include just a quick reference to the eye color
34:12
hair color height and build or whatever of each character and it can also mean
34:17
how you use simple phrases or certain things that are tied to each character so this might not be as detailed as your
34:24
character page but it might be just like a quick cheat sheet for referencing in this
34:30
quick little pdf that i've created for you i also have listed out those helpful tips that i
34:36
have for you um that we are going to i'm going to go over these in just a minute with you
34:42
and then another thing that i have here is a sample character template and again this is
34:48
something that i have just thrown together for you but you will want to customize it for
34:53
your own series bible but what i recommend is that when you have
34:58
something that you're tracking a lot of so characters would be one of them maybe objects would be another one or
35:04
magic system would be another one to create a template of the things that you want to track about
35:10
every character or every location every setting so that you're super consistent about it
35:16
because if you don't create a template like this then what's probably going to happen is you're going to
35:21
create a character for you know a page for jackson and you might track his hair color and eye color
35:26
but you forgot to track his identifying marks or his you know common phrases or gestures
35:32
and then when you go to reference the material you can be like oh i'm sure i've got his common phrases in there
35:37
but you forgot it because you didn't have a template so this helps you to stay consistent and it helps to make
35:43
sure that you track it's kind of like a prompt to make sure that you track everything you want to
35:48
track so this is just some examples of what you might want to do but i suggest you create the template
35:55
and then every time you create a new page for one of your characters you just simply highlight it copy it and paste it into your
36:01
characters page that way you have the prompt to enter his eye color his hair color his height and so on so for your series
36:08
you might want to specifically list out siblings or past people that they've dated or their
36:14
best friends or co-workers and just make it your own to fit your series
36:19
you could put their race you could put their allegiance if you have a lot of different organizations uh if you were writing something like
36:25
the hunger games you could have their district number here any common phrases or gestures that they
36:31
use or like i said things that are said often about them you can leave a section for when they
36:36
first appear in your series any special skills abilities or knowledge that they may have
36:42
so when it comes to this if you create a color code for your series
36:48
then at the beginning when we first meet jackson maybe the only special skill we know about him is that he can draw
36:54
the future so if i had book one was color coded in blue then the text i would write out here to
37:00
the side would say can draw the future and i would write that in blue because i discovered that
37:05
skill about jackson in the first book but let's say i discovered something about jackson later
37:11
or wrote something about jackson in book three where we find out that he can see clearly in the dark so that's
37:17
another ability or skill if book three was color coded to be purple then i would put
37:23
c's clearly in the dark in purple on my sheet so that when i'm quickly referencing this i can see the
37:30
progression of his abilities in terms of when the reader first discovered them or when the character himself first
37:36
discovered them as well in terms of when they appeared in the novel so this is really where color code can help you
37:43
you can also summarize their early life their experiences when they were younger where
37:48
they lived who they dated what college they went to whatever is important to your story you can discuss their wound or their
37:55
ghost which we've talked about before you can tell what this character is most passionate about or what their needs are
38:01
but here i have just a brief explanation is that aft after this more basic information at the
38:06
top you might consider creating a summary below this of every single book that this character
38:13
appears in so after you copied this template you might want to say book one beautiful demons
38:18
we first meet jackson blah blah blah blah and just give a summary of his character arc what happens in that book what
38:25
relationships he establishes what skills he acquires and basically what is his role in that
38:31
first book then below that you would write book two inner demons and you would say what happens with jackson in that book
38:38
so that you have not only an overview page of the entire series of each book in the entire series
38:45
but on each character page you also have a brief summary of that character's
38:50
journey in each story now like i said before you might not want to do this
38:55
much work for every single character especially if they're not going to be someone who recurs another thing you
39:01
might want to consider when you're creating these character templates and your series bible is if you have cross
39:07
world references so for example since we're talking about my character jackson from the shadow demon saga
39:12
he also makes an appearance in my sacrifice me series so this is something that i would want
39:18
to note here in the book summary section is that he appears in this
39:23
other spin-off so sort of like buffy and angel which series did they appear in and
39:29
where did characters you know often cross over to different series
39:34
i recommend creating a similar template for any other information you commonly track like
39:39
important places businesses objects skills timelines maps anything that you can think of so
39:45
hopefully this download helps you establish your own process so that you can be more consistent i
39:52
know it's a lot of decisions and sometimes it can feel overwhelming but again just remember that this is what you want
39:58
it to be i'm giving you a ton of examples but if your series is not super complex when it
40:04
comes to a lot of this stuff then don't worry about making your series bible super complex but the work
40:10
you put into this especially if you do have a long running cross world series will be
40:16
paying for itself in the long run because you'll have this amazing reference material that you can go back
40:24
to and make sure that your story stays consistent and as tightly written as possible okay so now that
Top Tips
40:30
we've talked about all the things that you want to track i'm going to give you some of my top tips for creating a really great
40:37
series bible number one identify your priorities right from the start because my priorities with a multiple
40:45
world multiple story 10 plus book series might be very different from you if you
40:52
just have a trilogy my priorities are going to be to have something that links and that i can track lots of different information and
40:58
put photos in and track a lot of different characters and cross world and stuff like that
41:03
but if you're just writing a trilogy and it's very simple and it just features two main characters and a little bit of
41:09
side stuff but you're never going to write side stories and all this other information your priorities probably will be very
41:15
different from mine you won't need something quite as complex so one of the first things you should do
41:21
is to really identify what type of series how long you think it's going to be how
41:26
complex you want to make your series bible and just make a list of like here are my
41:32
priorities here is how much time i want to put into it because when it comes to all things writing
41:37
there is no one-size-fits-all method so you need to decide for yourself what's important to you another tip i have for
41:43
you is to create a template of the common types of things that you're going to be tracking
41:49
once you've created this kind of thing this kind of template all you have to do is copy and paste so when i add a new
41:54
character to my series i copy and paste the template create a new page for them and i'm ready
42:00
to roll another tip that i have for you is to color code your wiki or your system
42:07
by book so if you have say 10 books in a series come up with a 10 book color coding
42:14
system so that book one is always blue and book two is always green and book three is always purple
42:19
then when you go in and you add text or you're adding you know using a different pen color or however your method is
42:26
but like when i go into the wiki and i wanna go and change something i can create text that is purple
42:31
for anything that i'm adding in on book three and then just make sure you have a key
42:36
somewhere very accessible like on the home page of your series bible or in the beginning of your binder that
42:42
lets you reminds you of that key so that when you're flipping through or when you're going through your information
42:48
if something is written or highlighted in that purple color you know that that information came out
42:54
in book three it makes it very visually easy to see where that information came in
43:00
where this character first appeared where these two people finally had their first kiss what book did that happen in
43:06
and so on so if you have a system that isn't as easy to color code then what you could do is you could
43:12
create some other kind of code like what i did when i was first creating my wiki is i had a
43:17
little tag per book so bd was beautiful demon's id was inner demons
43:23
bitter demons which is book three was bid i had a kind of abbreviation system
43:28
for the book so that if i needed to mark which book it happened in i would use that little code so come
43:35
up with some way to distinctively say inside your wiki which book this
43:42
occurred in because that can really help you later down the road another tip i have for you is to establish
43:48
the rules and the process for creating your series bible so for example when i was
43:55
talking about how you're going to organize your binder you don't want to just be throwing a bunch of papers in there willy-nilly
44:01
it's the same way when you create a wiki or a word doc you don't want to just have well i have this character pasted next to
44:07
a town pasted next to an object and then there's some magic system stuff over
44:12
here and some magic system stuff over here decide before you get started what how
44:18
you're gonna lay out your series bible so i'm gonna put characters in the front i'm going to have places over here i'm
44:23
going to have the magic system in this section and how exactly are you going to track it what are your templates going to be what
44:29
type of information are you going to track so sit down and actually plan out your
44:34
process and your organization methods and then stay consistent with it again
44:39
one of my main tips that i mentioned earlier is don't update your wiki until the book is
44:45
complete and i would say that that story those story
44:51
facts are canon so don't go through and update your wiki with information
44:57
that has not been solidified yet if you just want to have future information in there like i think
45:05
this is going to lead to this plot point then maybe choose like similarly a color
45:10
code or a certain type of system to mark in your wiki that this is information that is not yet
45:16
set in stone that way when you go back to do your research if you see this thing that says elena did such and such you can be like
45:22
oh well that's written in blue so maybe that didn't make it into the story because i never finalized it
45:28
have some sort of way to track that or do like i do what i do is when i'm planning
45:34
everything goes in my plotting binder so this is the stuff that isn't yet canon it isn't yet solidified into the
45:40
story this is just the planning then i go through once the book is through the editors through the beta
45:47
readers and it is done and ready to be published that's when i update my wiki because it's going out to readers now it is solid
45:54
fact in my story world that's when it gets documented in my series bible a final tip
Final Tips
46:00
that i have for you is do as much as you need to do and track as much as you need to
46:06
track to make your story writing more efficient and easy to search
46:11
but don't keep from writing that next book because you're endlessly updating don't
46:17
allow your series bible to be another form of procrastination or holding yourself back
46:22
that's one of my final tips because you could spend years going through and creating pages
46:28
and this whole back end of a spider web of information but none of it really matters if you're not writing the books and getting them
46:34
out to readers so do the minimum you need to do to make your series bible work for you
46:40
and then get back to writing okay in the final section of this video we're just going to briefly go over how do you
46:46
actually use your series bible once it's created once you are getting ready to write the next book in your series
46:52
i what i like to do is go back and reference my series bible and i will go into those story
46:58
summaries and i will read through the summaries of the character and story arcs of the books that came
47:03
before me if you don't track this in your series bible then you won't use this but if you have those summaries they can be really
47:10
good to getting your mind back focused on where you are in the series that way you can see what breadcrumbs
47:16
still have to be carried through what story questions haven't been answered and what happened with your characters in the
47:22
previous book so it's a great refresher then i also will go back through my
47:27
style sheet or my style guide and i will refresh my memory on how did i capitalize this how did i
47:33
say this particular phrase was it italicized order of shadows was capital o capital s
47:39
shadow demon was that capital s capital d or lower case and you just refresh your
47:44
style guide on those types of things so that you stay as consistent as possible when you're writing the book which
47:50
leaves for less work to do in edits if when i'm writing i come across something
47:56
that i'm like i probably need to look that up i don't always like to stop the flow of words and
48:04
go search for it sometimes i will but most of the time i don't i've mentioned this before in my editing video
48:10
what i will do is i will mark that section or that piece of text with an xx in the
48:17
text so i'll say something like jackson stared up at the three moons blah blah blah and then i'll think were there
48:23
three moons or are there four or are there five how many moons are in the shadow demons then i'll put out in parentheses xx
48:29
in my rough draft and then i'll just keep writing then when i get to either get home and
48:35
i'm editing for the day or if i'm just done with the draft one of the first things that i do is i
48:41
go through and search my document for xx and i go in find all of those instances
48:48
where i put an xx and anything there that i can reference
48:53
or research inside my series bible i will research at that point so if i get to this point
48:59
where i mention the moons i'll say okay let me open up my series bible and let me search for
49:04
shadow world or let me search for moon and i will find the answer okay there are four moons they
49:11
come out at this here's the rules of how that works so this would work in jackson's case i will fix my document
49:17
with the actual facts of the book that is a really great way to add consistency to your books but not
49:25
take you out of the writing by having to like search back through 10 books to find that information then finally like i said if you are
49:32
willing to give that password out to a beta reader or someone you even like an editor you pay
49:37
to read for consistency then you can also use your series bible as a fact checker
49:43
so this is something that i think is good to get in the habit of doing either yourself or paying or having someone else do for
49:49
you especially when you're writing a really long series okay you guys that is a long and
49:55
hopefully detailed and helpful overview of how and why you create a series bible
50:00
what types of things you need to track where you can create your series bible and other methods that might help you
50:05
and tips and tricks so i hope you enjoyed this i would love to show you
50:11
my detailed series bible but there's just too much information in there that i do actually have some
50:16
future plot ideas that are delineated with italics in my series bible that i just cannot show it
50:23
so plus there's tons of spoilers in there for people that haven't read the book so i'm not gonna show my
50:29
series bible but i will be soon setting up a series bible for my series the witches key when i go to
50:36

52:41
you
hey guys welcome back to heart
0:01
breathings today we're going to talk
0:03
about how to conquer your fear of
0:06
actually putting your work out in the
0:08
world i know it can seem really scary
0:10
so let's talk about how to get over that
0:18
so first of all i will kind of address
0:21
the sound of my voice and give a little
0:23
bit of a chatty update here in the
0:25
beginning that if you have noticed that
0:27
i haven't really been on my game with my
0:29
videos or been really present on social
0:32
media at all for the last week or so is
0:35
because there have been a lot of things
0:36
happening behind the scenes one is that
0:39
we bought a house so i will share more
0:42
about that with you guys but we closed
0:43
on a property yesterday and we'll be
0:46
moving in later in february so i'm
0:48
moving to texas there will be lots of um
0:51
pictures and other things that i will
0:52
share with you but that will be coming
0:54
up but also our little family contracted
0:58
coveted all four of us i thought it was
1:00
a stomach bug for the kids and that's
1:02
where it kind of started and then we all
1:04
have been sort of healing our way
1:06
through it it has been thank god pretty
1:09
mild case more like just like having a
1:11
head cold and being a little bit tired
1:13
but i have been definitely taking the
1:15
rest that i need so you haven't seen me
1:17
on as much and that's why my voice
1:19
sounds a little bit different because i
1:20
do have that still sort of head cold
1:22
version of covet going right now but we
1:24
are safe and i hope you are staying safe
1:26
as well but let's get back to the real
1:29
topic at hand today which is you know
1:32
when you
1:33
get your ideas for writing a novel and
1:35
you start really thinking about all the
1:37
fun things and all the exciting ideas
1:40
the story that you want to tell that is
1:43
where the passion comes in is the story
1:46
that you're excited about and those kind
1:47
of ideas we start working on them the
1:49
story flows things start getting really
1:51
exciting
1:53
but when we start to think about someone
1:56
else reading those ideas someone else
1:59
reading that story or even paying for
2:01
that story and then having the right to
2:04
criticize it and like it or not like it
2:07
that's where for many of us this sort of
2:09
paralyzing fear can come in because now
2:12
it's not just about us and this fun idea
2:14
that we have it's not just the
2:15
playground of our story and our
2:17
imagination now it's suddenly something
2:19
to be judged and criticized and that can
2:22
be
2:23
frankly quite terrifying so let's kind
2:26
of dive into how to overcome that fear
2:29
and actually start putting your work out
2:31
in the world so before i go into
2:34
the top three things that i feel like
2:36
are the biggest tools in your tool kit
2:38
to get over fear let's kind of talk
2:41
about the fact that your fears are not
2:43
entirely unfounded there are a lot of
2:47
struggles whether you decide to
2:48
traditionally publish or you decide to
2:51
self-publish once strangers who don't
2:53
know and love you and want to support
2:55
you begin to pick up your work there are
2:58
some scary things involved there and you
3:00
can conquer your fear but these are
3:02
going to always be a part of the
3:04
publishing process and to be honest it
3:06
doesn't always go away so
3:09
just because it's your 30th novel
3:10
doesn't mean now you don't care what
3:12
other people think or you're totally in
3:14
you know incredibly confident i know new
3:17
york times bestsellers who hit the usa
3:19
today list every single time with every
3:21
single book who are still
3:23
going through massive anxiety every time
3:26
they publish a novel because you never
3:27
know if people are going to like this
3:29
one and every novel kind of has its own
3:32
personality its own struggles its own
3:34
challenges so it's like what about this
3:36
heroine will they like her will they
3:37
like the choices i made for this like
3:40
for me right now i am currently working
3:42
on the 12th book of a series that i've
3:43
been writing for over a decade and a lot
3:46
rides on how i finish out her story and
3:49
whether people are going to like it and
3:50
that is going to color whether they love
3:52
this whole series now that it's over so
3:55
you have to understand that that fear of
3:58
what people are going to think is just
4:00
going to be a part of the publishing
4:02
process it's never going to go away just
4:04
because you put that first book out
4:05
there and even if you find massive
4:07
success you're still going to have those
4:09
fears so let me just
4:11
kind of comfort you in knowing that it's
4:13
normal that there's nothing wrong with
4:15
you it doesn't mean that your books are
4:17
terrible and that's why you have this
4:18
secret fear it just means that we're all
4:22
emotionally attached to our work and
4:24
that's totally normal and it's going to
4:26
be something that you're gonna get
4:27
through every single time and once those
4:30
good reviews start pouring in it's gonna
4:32
start to feel a lot better but the truth
4:34
is in this career there are going to be
4:37
bad reviews everyone gets them even the
4:39
most important significant works
4:42
pulitzer prize-winning like
4:44
most significant things that have been
4:46
written in history have bad reviews or
4:48
people that don't like them it's just a
4:50
part of it so
4:51
that is something we're gonna have to
4:52
deal with also you're gonna have books
4:56
that flop we all have books that don't
4:58
do as well as we expected on release
5:00
date there are also going to be things
5:02
like just recently amazon's been having
5:04
this crazy thing with sales ranking
5:06
where it's taking them sometimes three
5:07
or four days to update sales rank and it
5:09
has really messed with people's releases
5:11
so there are going to be sometimes
5:13
outside forces that you can't control
5:15
that are going to affect whether this
5:16
book does as well as you hoped it would
5:18
so there's going to be all kinds of
5:20
those factors there's also going to be a
5:22
lot of people out there that are going
5:23
to be bragging to you about how they
5:25
made 50 000 on their very first novel in
5:28
two weeks you know or there are entire
5:30
facebook groups of people where they
5:31
just talk about how much money they make
5:33
or what their success is and that's
5:35
awesome like we want to see people
5:36
succeeding but when you're in a low
5:38
point sometimes seeing that excitement
5:41
from others can bring us down because
5:43
it's like why not me and so we're going
5:45
to have to deal with that comparisonitis
5:47
that we sometimes face in this
5:49
particular industry there may be
5:51
stretches of time where you don't sell a
5:53
single book days weeks sometimes where
5:55
you don't even have a single sale and
5:57
that gets tough right it can make you
5:59
feel like what's wrong with me why isn't
6:01
my book selling am i a terrible author
6:03
and all those things can start to make
6:05
you doubt yourself along the way you're
6:07
probably going to make some mistakes i
6:09
know that i have i have a few horror
6:12
stories of typos and other mistakes that
6:14
i've made with my files when i'm
6:15
uploading them and especially when
6:17
you're indie published and you're in
6:18
control of all of those pieces you're
6:20
going to make mistakes sometimes and
6:22
sometimes like what i did this past year
6:24
you're going to miss pre-order deadlines
6:26
and people are going to be upset so
6:27
these are just some of the challenges
6:29
that you might face and in the end you
6:32
have to understand that there's nothing
6:34
wrong with you that every single person
6:36
who embarks on this makes these mistakes
6:38
everybody has bad sales days everybody
6:41
compares themselves to others in some
6:43
way at some point in their career it is
6:46
totally normal and there are some really
6:49
great tools that you can put into your
6:51
toolbox your emotional toolbox your
6:53
strategic toolbox that can help you
6:55
conquer these fears and get past it i
6:58
think that the reason i wanted to start
6:59
this video by talking about what some of
7:01
those realistic things are that you're
7:03
going to face is because it wouldn't do
7:05
me any good to sit here and tell you
7:08
you know nobody's going to have these
7:09
fears once you get that book out there
7:11
you're going to be so confident that you
7:12
won't ever have these fears again or to
7:14
tell you that like you're going to be so
7:16
massively successful that you'll never
7:18
doubt yourself again and everything's
7:19
going to be rainbows because that is not
7:22
the story for anybody in indie
7:24
publishing we all face these things and
7:26
it's important to come into it with your
7:28
eyes wide open and understand that it's
7:30
not easy to put your work out there
7:33
and it's not always easy to find your
7:35
strategy and your way of getting sales
7:38
there are challenges involved and
7:39
sometimes when you're putting your work
7:41
out there as an indie author and it's
7:44
just you and it can feel very raw
7:47
it's important to understand that it is
7:50
going to feel vulnerable sometimes and
7:52
you're going to have failures and
7:53
mistakes it's just part of it so go into
7:55
it understanding that you will need to
7:58
develop a little bit of a thick skin
8:00
around
8:01
what other people have to say or the
8:03
mistakes that you might make along the
8:05
way but
8:06
it's also important to start to build
8:08
your own confidence so that's what we're
8:10
going to talk about now in my opinion
8:12
there are three main tools to really put
8:14
into your toolbox and spend your time on
8:16
that will help you conquer those fears
8:18
and understand that they're normal and
8:20
you're going to get them and then you're
8:21
going to see them and face them and move
8:23
right past it like a total pro so the
8:26
number one thing is to continue to
8:28
always work on improving your craft the
8:32
better you write
8:34
the more you learn to connect with
8:35
readers the more you understand the
8:37
genre that you're writing what readers
8:39
really want and expect out of your
8:41
writing
8:42
every author i feel like has their major
8:45
like in like innate strengths and if you
8:48
can begin to understand by reading
8:50
reviews by talking to your readers by
8:52
seeing what they respond to if you can
8:54
start to understand what it is they love
8:57
not just about your books but about your
8:59
brand of storytelling you can begin to
9:02
really do that more intentionally and
9:04
put more of that into your work more of
9:06
yourself and what makes you unique and
9:08
the more you learn about how to craft a
9:10
really good story that keeps people on
9:12
their toes or makes them cry or makes
9:14
them fall in love or whatever your genre
9:17
is wanting to do for that reader the
9:19
better you get at that the more
9:21
confident you're going to become because
9:22
your reviews are going to get better
9:24
your sales are going to get better you
9:26
will know and be able to take pride in
9:28
the fact that you are growing as an
9:31
author like i go back to beautiful
9:33
demons which was my first book published
9:35
back in 2010 and i'm very proud of that
9:37
book and it has brought me a lot of
9:39
success but i can see leaps and bounds
9:43
between that book and book 11 in the
9:45
series that i just published last year
9:47
because i have continued to work on my
9:49
craft i read books about writing i
9:52
consume youtube videos i'm actually
9:53
about to start brandon sanderson's whole
9:56
series on plotting here on youtube so if
9:58
you've seen that let me know in the
9:59
comments what you thought but he's so
10:00
brilliant and he's such a great writer
10:02
and i want to learn from him so one of
10:04
the best tools that you can put in your
10:06
toolbox is to sort of put on that hat of
10:10
being a constant learner don't ever get
10:13
to the point where you think okay i've
10:14
learned everything i possibly can about
10:16
writing because no one ever gets to that
10:19
point and the more you can embrace that
10:21
feeling of i want to continue to learn
10:23
and get better the more confidence
10:26
you're going to get in your own writing
10:28
and i promise you 100
10:30
the more good feedback you're going to
10:31
start getting from people the more sales
10:33
are going to happen the more momentum
10:34
you're going to get in your career
10:36
because you're becoming a better writer
10:38
along the way and that's one of the few
10:40
things in this business that we can
10:41
control
10:42
is how much time we put into our own
10:45
skill and craft as a writer so never
10:47
stop learning that's one of the main
10:48
things to put in your toolbox to
10:50
increase your confidence as a writer and
10:52
conquer those fears number two and this
10:54
is super super important and it does
10:56
actually translate to traditional
10:58
publishing as well but i'm more
10:59
specifically talking about when you're
11:01
self-publishing is to arm yourself with
11:03
the knowledge of how to stack the odds
11:06
in your favor this is something i talk
11:08
about quite a bit in my self-publishing
11:10
course publish and thrive because it's
11:12
so important like nobody has a perfect
11:16
career but there is a lot to learn
11:19
there's a steep learning curve when it
11:21
comes to self-publishing you've got to
11:23
learn how to market your books you have
11:24
to learn how to format them to edit them
11:26
to upload you have to figure out how to
11:29
create the right cover for your genre
11:31
there's so many different pieces to kind
11:33
of slide into place and every single
11:36
thing that you do to the very best of
11:38
your ability that creates part of your
11:41
self-publishing strategy is meant to
11:43
stack the odds in your favor meaning
11:46
that every little piece from your cover
11:48
to your metadata to your blurb to
11:51
whether you're going to put yourself in
11:53
the right categories to
11:55
how you write that intro to what your
11:57
characters are doing to how you put your
12:00
back matter how you market your books
12:02
what price point you have all of those
12:04
little pieces are important part of the
12:06
puzzle of how many books you're gonna
12:08
sell how you're going to get those books
12:10
out to readers and so every little piece
12:13
if you understand what's the best way to
12:16
put your particular book out on the
12:18
market is another way to stack the odds
12:21
in your favor
12:22
if you have a cover that's not quite
12:24
right for your genre and you're kind of
12:26
writing across two or three genres and
12:28
you're not really sure where it goes and
12:30
you don't know what other books are kind
12:31
of like yours and then you price the
12:33
book like way too high and you know then
12:36
you're writing three other series all at
12:38
once so you have long stretches between
12:40
books you're not you know setting the
12:42
odds in your favor you're not stacking
12:43
the odds in your favor but if you
12:45
haven't studied
12:47
or learned from someone who knows the
12:50
industry
12:51
then how do you know what it means to
12:53
stack the odds in your favor you're just
12:55
kind of watching what other people do
12:57
and hoping like throwing spaghetti
12:59
across the wall and hoping that
13:01
something's going to stick when you
13:02
really take the time to learn
13:05
how do i set my business up what is the
13:07
proper strategy what do i need to put
13:10
into this blurb to get readers to know
13:12
it how do i launch my book what's the
13:14
order i should do things in once you
13:16
start to learn those things and you
13:17
develop a strategy that really works you
13:19
begin to really stack those odds in your
13:21
favor and that's one of the biggest ways
13:23
that you can begin to overcome your fear
13:26
because you're you you've got kind of an
13:28
armor over you of saying okay
13:31
i know that what i'm doing is going to
13:33
put me in the very best possible
13:35
position for success and then i can
13:37
tweak from there and i can see what i
13:39
can control when we don't know what
13:41
we're doing and we still have so much to
13:43
learn it just feels like this big
13:45
tangled amount of things that we have to
13:47
do and we can't really decide what needs
13:50
to change because it's just this big
13:52
massive like
13:54
blob in our head of i don't really know
13:57
what i'm doing here but when we really
13:59
start to learn each of those individual
14:01
pieces and we start to learn how to
14:02
tweak them how to come up with that
14:04
strategy then you start to have real
14:06
power in your pocket and so learning
14:09
from other people obviously i would love
14:11
to invite you to sign up for my publish
14:14
and thrive course which is open now it
14:16
only opens twice a year and so it's open
14:18
right now we start monday february 7th
14:21
and it goes for five weeks and we learn
14:23
all of those little strategies you learn
14:25
every tiny thing about how to run your
14:27
business upload your books format your
14:29
books get your website going
14:31
come up with your publishing strategy
14:33
how to market and advertise your books
14:35
and then also how to manage the mental
14:37
rollercoaster of all of this stuff so
14:39
come join us in that class but even if
14:41
publish and thrive is not right for you
14:43
that's okay there are lots of other
14:45
places that you can go like some of the
14:47
things i talk about on this channel
14:48
david gogren is another like wealth of
14:51
information out there so i will link his
14:53
stuff down below mark dawson talks a lot
14:55
about advertising so i'll link some of
14:57
his stuff as well as chris fox joanna
14:59
penn there are amazing people that are
15:02
out there sharing what they've learned
15:03
so i will link some of those free
15:05
resources for you down below but i'll
15:06
also leave a link to my course if you
15:08
would like to come join us in publish
15:10
and thrive the more knowledge you have
15:12
about the industry and how to set
15:14
yourself up for success the less
15:16
mistakes you're going to make and the
15:17
more confidence you're going to have
15:18
when you put yourself out there like you
15:20
know your cover is really good you know
15:22
that you've got the right strategy you
15:23
know your book is going to be set up for
15:25
success and that is a huge tool to have
15:28
in your toolbox and the third thing is
15:31
to have a community of writers that
15:33
surround you that really lift you up
15:36
rather than pull you down so that can
15:38
look different for everyone because for
15:40
some people seeing success stories where
15:42
people are talking about how much money
15:44
they make really lifts them up and they
15:45
say that's going to be me someday for
15:47
others of us when we see people talking
15:49
about oh i made a hundred grand this
15:50
month or you know i had this big success
15:53
or i've sold 50 000 books my first week
15:55
of publishing that can make us feel like
15:58
we're not
15:59
going fast enough and so two very
16:01
different people might see that exact
16:03
same post two very different ways but
16:05
the key is for you as an individual to
16:08
find a community that really resonates
16:10
with you that feels good where you feel
16:12
uplifted where you feel like people are
16:14
cheering you on like they
16:17
are there for you that if you post your
16:19
cover and you say what do you think of
16:20
this you're going to be able to hear you
16:22
know positive feedback as well as some
16:24
criticism and know that it's done with
16:26
love and with your success in mind so
16:29
having that community of people that you
16:31
feel like you can lean on and say hey
16:33
will you read my blurb hey will you
16:34
check this out can you tell me what you
16:36
think of this did you try have you tried
16:38
this and you can ask them questions and
16:40
feel like they're lifting you up and
16:42
sharing your work and and getting
16:44
excited when you have a new release
16:46
that's going to help you more than
16:47
anything the friends that i have made on
16:49
this journey my true like
16:51
self-publishing buddy friends that has
16:54
made all the difference for me those
16:55
private communities those facebook
16:57
groups those
16:59
zoom calls and meetings that i've had
17:01
with friends meeting people at
17:02
conferences just has given me so much
17:04
confidence to keep going even when i
17:07
make those mistakes i have those friends
17:08
that are right there with me saying oh
17:10
my gosh i'm so sorry that happened it's
17:12
gonna be okay and then they say oh you
17:14
should hear this time i made a mistake
17:15
too and having those friendships and
17:17
that community that surrounds you can
17:19
make all the difference so again if you
17:21
join publish and thrive you're going to
17:23
get access to that on facebook or you
17:25
can come join us on discord but i also
17:28
if you're not interested in joining the
17:30
course we also have a writing group
17:32
called the heart breathings writing
17:34
community and it is expanding so we've
17:36
only been on
17:38
facebook up to this point as like a
17:40
writing sprints group but now there is
17:42
actually a page over on my website that
17:44
has a google calendar where you can join
17:46
in on all the writing sprints here on
17:48
youtube and this weekend we have our
17:51
double down day which is an all-day
17:52
writing sprint event so there will be
17:54
information on that on my blog as well
17:57
that'll have all the times and all of
17:59
the information on how to join that so
18:01
come join that writing community just
18:02
having people that you can write with
18:05
sprint with ask questions are going to
18:06
cheer you on and get excited about you
18:08
finishing your novel all of that helps
18:11
so much in getting you past that hurdle
18:13
of being afraid to put your work out
18:15
there in the end i know that it can feel
18:17
really scary to have anybody judging
18:20
your work or having to put yourself out
18:23
there and you know there's an investment
18:24
when you self-publish like oh you might
18:26
be putting hundreds of dollars into the
18:28
process of publishing it and you want to
18:30
get that money back and you want to find
18:32
success and we have so many of our hopes
18:34
and dreams tied to putting those books
18:37
out there and to pouring our hearts into
18:39
those books it's hard enough to finish a
18:41
novel but then to actually you know put
18:43
it on display can be tough and yes you
18:46
do need a thick skin for some of it but
18:49
you can also surround yourself with
18:50
community and with knowledge and with
18:53
skill that is going to help you
18:55
gain confidence and find success in this
18:58
business because truthfully what's the
19:00
alternative that you just never put your
19:02
work out there
19:04
then you have to think sure then no one
19:06
can criticize it but no one can fall in
19:08
love with it either and that is the key
19:10
because that's why you're doing this not
19:13
for the people that are going to
19:14
criticize or the people that don't get
19:15
it or people don't like your heroine
19:17
like that's every book there's somebody
19:19
that doesn't like that you're writing it
19:21
for the people that are going to connect
19:22
with that story they're going to say oh
19:24
my gosh that meant the world to me and
19:26
you're going to start to get messages
19:28
from people that are like your books
19:29
carried me through one of the darkest
19:31
times of my life or your books make me
19:33
want to fall in love again or your books
19:34
make me want to be the best person i can
19:36
be or i finally found laughter again
19:39
because of your books or i stayed up all
19:41
night not even caring about work
19:43
tomorrow because i couldn't put it down
19:44
and i love your books you're gonna get
19:46
more of those messages i promise you
19:49
than you will the criticism so write
19:52
your books and publish them for those
19:54
people for the people that are really
19:55
going to appreciate it and that are
19:56
going to love it because that's your
19:58
true audience so continue to work on
20:00
your craft and make yourself the very
20:02
best writer that you can be so that you
20:04
build confidence number two
20:06
learn all you can about how to set the
20:09
odds in your favor how to stack those
20:12
odds so that you can set yourself up for
20:13
success whether it's from taking a
20:15
course consuming youtube videos podcasts
20:18

20:20

20:22

20:24

[Music]
21:20
you

hey everybody welcome back to heart
0:01
briefings my name is Sarah cannon I am
0:04
the indie author of more than 25 novels
0:06
and I'm so excited that you're here I
0:08
just got back from the novelist's Inc
0:10
conference so if you are new subscriber
0:12
from nink welcome it was such an amazing
0:15
conference so thank you to everybody who
0:17
came out to hear me speak and who talked
0:19
to me afterwards and it was just really
0:21
great so I'm glad that so many of you
0:23
have joined us here for everybody else
0:25
if you have been around for a while you
0:27
guys know that I just had a baby she is
0:29
one month old as of yesterday and I just
0:32
cannot believe how fast time is flying
0:34
that's why there have been a little bit
0:36
less videos than normal but I'm excited
0:38
to be back kind of on schedule I'm gonna
0:40
try to have a video out every Thursday
0:42
and sometimes on Sunday so I hope that
0:45
you'll subscribe and hit that
0:46
notification bell so that you'll get
0:48
notified when new videos come up from me
0:49
because we've got prepped Oberer and
0:51
NaNoWriMo and then end-of-the-year
0:53
planning sessions and stuff for writing
0:55
coming up but today what we're going to
0:57
talk about is one of my most requested
0:58
videos and something that I think a lot
1:01
of us struggle with which is how to know
1:03
which series or which story to write
1:06
next is how to decide and I figured this
1:08
is a perfect time to talk about it
1:10
because we do have NaNoWriMo coming up
1:12
and it can just be really tough which
1:14
story to write you know you want to get
1:16
it done you know you want to write those
1:17
50,000 words but there's so many ideas
1:19
in your head it's hard to choose so
1:21
let's get into it
1:25
so this is something that I struggle
1:28
with as well because I have so many
1:31
different ideas and I feel like even
1:33
when I'm writing a series and I'm loving
1:35
what's happening with these characters
1:36
more ideas keep coming and they come
1:38
from everywhere they come from real life
1:40
they come from the news they come from
1:42
other movies that I watch are there
1:43
books that I read I think all of that
1:45
would be cool if I combined this and
1:46
this or you know just ideas come when
1:48
you're in the shower or taking a walk
1:50
they come all the time so how do you
1:52
choose which idea is really the best
1:54
idea what I'm going to do is I'm gonna
1:57
give you six tips for ways that will
2:00
help you make the best choice but just
2:02
know this unless you have a crystal ball
2:05
or a time machine and you can go forward
2:07
in the future and try all these
2:08
different stories out there's really no
2:11
way to know which idea is the best idea
2:13
you can do all of these types of things
2:15
that I'm going to give you some tips on
2:17
and still not know which one's gonna be
2:20
the bestseller which one's gonna be the
2:22
most fun to write which one's gonna be
2:23
the easiest to write until you actually
2:25
get in and you get it done my one
2:28
warning about it though is that you need
2:30
to make a decision and that's one of the
2:31
most important things decide which story
2:34
which series you're going to write and
2:36
don't waste any more time on it follow
2:38
the tips that I'm gonna give you give
2:39
yourself a deadline and say okay like
2:42
especially if you're trying NaNoWriMo
2:43
and it starts November 1st and you want
2:45
to do some plotting and stuff before
2:46
that or some story notes then give
2:48
yourself until October 10th and say okay
2:51
I'm gonna give myself one week and I'm
2:54
gonna make a decision at that point and
2:55
you can follow these tips that I'm gonna
2:57
give you but give yourself a deadline
2:58
where you say this is it
3:00
this is when the decision is going to be
3:01
made because otherwise you could
3:03
literally spend three to six months to a
3:05
year trying to decide between story
3:07
ideas and the other danger of course is
3:10
that if you're not sure about which
3:13
story you're choosing you could get into
3:14
a story and go about halfway through and
3:16
then of course in the middle things
3:18
always get tough and so you start to
3:20
doubt yourself and you say this is too
3:22
hard I'm gonna try this other story idea
3:25
that I had does this sound familiar to
3:27
any of you hit alike and go in the
3:29
comments and let me know because I've
3:30
done this a million times myself when
3:32
the story gets hard I switch and say
3:33
well I'm gonna try this other thing and
3:35
that one gets you know going for a
3:37
little bit and when that story gets hard
3:38
and you could spend your whole
3:39
life doing this so the key is to just
3:41
make a decision set a deadline and then
3:45
commit to finishing it no matter what
3:47
when it gets hard it doesn't matter
3:48
commit to finishing it especially if
3:51
you've been someone who hasn't been
3:52
finishing this is your chance okay so
3:55
here's my six tips for how to help you
3:57
choose the next story or the next series
3:59
that you're going to write number one is
4:01
to write out a synopsis of your idea so
4:04
this doesn't mean you have to write 20
4:06
pages or anything like that but even
4:08
just one page of this is really the idea
4:10
so maybe this is gonna look like a
4:12
handwritten page that says it's set in a
4:15
dystopian world where there's a virtual
4:17
reality and there's a girl who has been
4:19
banned from logging into this virtual
4:21
reality game world and instead she works
4:24
in the dystopian world and she has this
4:25
really tough life but she's a hacker and
4:28
she puts this she's put together this
4:31
black market gear and she hacks in and
4:34
she becomes Robin Hood when she's online
4:35
she steals from the rich and gives to
4:37
the poor and everyone in control is
4:39
chasing her so this is one of the ideas
4:41
that I have for a book of mine that I
4:44
just lovingly call hacked but the short
4:46
story that begins this is actually in a
4:49
short story anthology called once upon a
4:51
star but let's say that's the basic idea
4:54
you write all that down maybe you write
4:56
some things down about this character
4:58
what's her name and then tell yourself
5:01
what's the conflict of this story
5:03
obviously in the story that I was just
5:05
talking about the conflict is that she's
5:07
banned from going in and she's illegally
5:09
going in and now the guys that run the
5:11
server are looking for her so her life's
5:13
in danger there's also going to be more
5:15
conflict in that story so I would go on
5:17
and I would write the other ideas that I
5:18
have so she gets recruited by another
5:20
underground kind of black-market crew
5:22
similar to the matrix so this is
5:25
something I also call the matrix meets
5:27
Robin Hood so let's say that's an idea
5:30
that you have so you would write down
5:31
that conflict you would write down the
5:33
group that is going to be kind of an
5:35
inciting incident is her getting
5:36
recruited to this group so how does the
5:39
story get started who are your main
5:41
characters what's the conflict so what I
5:43
recommend is writing out that synopsis
5:46
with the characters the conflict all of
5:49
that for every single story idea that
5:51
you're
5:52
seriously consider considering writing
5:54
then you want to ask yourself do I want
5:56
to write a standalone book or do I want
5:59
to write a series so let's say NaNoWriMo
6:01
is coming up and you know you want to
6:03
write 50,000 words but maybe you're
6:06
planning to indie publish this and you
6:07
want it to be a series so it's going to
6:09
be five or six books so this synopsis is
6:11
going to give you an idea of kind of how
6:13
much teeth this story has how much
6:15
longevity it has if you can't really
6:17
come up with enough ideas to fill one
6:19
piece of paper then maybe this idea was
6:21
kind of a cool concept but it's not
6:23
going to have enough depth and idea for
6:27
you to really branch it into multiple
6:29
books or maybe you know you just want it
6:31
to be a standalone you're going to write
6:32
these 50,000 words for NaNoWriMo and
6:34
then you're done or you want it to be a
6:36
standalone because you want to see if
6:38
you can query and get an agent with it
6:40
or whatever it is that you know you want
6:42
to do think about what your end game is
6:45
it's a standalone or it's something you
6:47
want to write for years to come and then
6:48
use that synopsis to see how much idea
6:51
you really have so that's the first step
6:53
if you can't come up with any conflict
6:57
the ideas don't start to flow it just is
7:00
like I don't know what is this what is
7:01
the best character and you've just got
7:02
all these decisions and you can't really
7:04
make it but you've got this one story
7:06
out of the safe 5 synopsis that you did
7:09
that just started flowing then maybe
7:11
that's a good indication that that's the
7:13
story you need to write because you've
7:16
got so many ideas that are starting to
7:18
flow that would give you an idea of it
7:20
because a lot of times I think we have
7:22
these nebulous like ooh there's all
7:23
these ideas flowing in our head but we
7:25
haven't really thought them through so
7:27
when you sit down and you force yourself
7:28
to put pen to paper and really write out
7:30
the idea the conflict the characters the
7:32
setting you're gonna start to see which
7:34
ideas have more substance to it than
7:37
some of the others okay number two once
7:40
you've done this and I would recommend
7:41
doing these in order but you could just
7:43
pick any one random one and do that so
7:45
tip number two is to check your
7:47
excitement level so let's say you've
7:49
taken the time to say five different
7:51
stories right out the synopsis of five
7:53
different stories and while you were
7:55
writing it I want you to think back on
7:57
that synopsis and think which one am I
8:00
most excited to write so see how you
8:03
feel do you get that sort of butterfly
8:05
and your heart starts pumping and you've
8:07
got all these ideas and when you go to
8:09
talk about it you start to get excited
8:11
when you think about it you get excited
8:14
what's your excitement level for this
8:15
story because the more you love the
8:18
story the more passionate you are about
8:20
that idea and that story world and
8:22
writing that character and the more you
8:23
connect with her or him the more likely
8:26
you are to actually want to write that
8:28
story so this is kind of the second
8:30
check you've checked to see how much
8:32
idea and how much substance there is now
8:34
check to see which one you're most
8:36
excited about writing and this is often
8:38
a really good clue now sometimes you may
8:40
find out of those five ideas there's
8:42
still three of them that you're super
8:44
excited about writing but at least you
8:46
can cross off those other two and now
8:48
you've narrowed it down so let's move on
8:50
to tip number three tip number three is
8:52
another writing assignment so in this I
8:54
want you to try to write to the most
8:56
vivid scene that you can already picture
8:58
in your mind so if you've got say you've
9:01
narrowed it down to three different
9:02
ideas think about each one individually
9:04
go back to the synopsis that you wrote
9:07
out see if you can figure out one scene
9:10
that comes to mind it could be a scene
9:11
that happens at the very end of the book
9:13
it could be the very first opening scene
9:15
of the book or it could just be a random
9:16
scene that you're not sure where it's
9:17
gonna fit in but you can picture it
9:19
really clearly in your head so pull out
9:21
the synopsis of book number one idea
9:23
number one close your eyes and start to
9:26
imagine it playing like a movie in your
9:28
head can you see the scene happening so
9:30
for example when I talk about my Robin
9:32
Hood Meets The Matrix story I knew for a
9:35
long time that there's this one very
9:36
vivid scene that I could picture in my
9:39
head featured a pirate ship and her
9:41
trying to steal something and there
9:43
being another guy in the room and the
9:44
interaction that happened between them
9:46
and I was super excited about it when I
9:48
closed my eyes I could see it playing
9:49
around playing in my head like a movie
9:51
and so I just sat down to write it and I
9:54
knew that that was something I was
9:55
excited about so when you do that do it
9:57
for book number one then maybe the next
9:59
day sit down and do it for idea number
10:01
two then the next day sit down and do it
10:03
for idea number three and take notes
10:05
along the way as to like when you're
10:07
done with your writing out that scene
10:09
make a note for yourself how easily did
10:11
those words come how quickly did they
10:14
flow how did you feel about them did you
10:16
really like get in that character's head
10:18
really
10:18
easily like you just slid into it and
10:20
you could see the world so clearly and
10:22
you just felt like it was really good
10:23
writing or was every word like pulling
10:26
teeth for you and that's gonna give you
10:28
another indication as to whether this is
10:30
the story you should be writing right
10:32
now I'm a firm believer that when a
10:34
story is hot you should jump on it and
10:36
go for it because when you're really
10:38
excited about a story when you love it
10:40
and the words are flowing and those
10:41
ideas are there it's a gift that you
10:43
have it's like tapping into some
10:45
invisible type of magic that allows you
10:47
to really flow with that story
10:50
so if you have the opportunity be
10:51
starting something new pick the story
10:54
that gets you the most excited like I
10:56
said earlier but also that starts to
10:58
flow and a lot of times those are going
11:00
to be the same same things but if you've
11:02
already been excited about three
11:04
different stories see which one causes
11:06
the ideas to flow and the excitement to
11:08
come even more when you're actually
11:10
writing it so I would say give yourself
11:12
at least you know a thousand words and
11:14
if it's blowing keep going with it when
11:17
I sat down to write that hacked intro i
11:19
sat down and wrote almost 6,000 words in
11:21
a single session because I was so
11:23
excited so that kind of thing when you
11:24
just want to keep writing is a really
11:27
good indication now again what happens
11:29
if all three of them are still something
11:32
you're excited about or let's say that
11:33
you did that exercise and you narrowed
11:35
it down to two where the words are
11:36
flowing you're really excited about it
11:38
what can you do now to narrow it down so
11:40
tip number four is to look at the market
11:43
so if you are planning to just write
11:45
this for fun this one doesn't matter as
11:47
much to you but if you're looking to
11:49
write this and actually sell it so
11:51
either you're going to indie publish it
11:52
and try to sell it directly to readers
11:54
or you're going to try to get an agent
11:56
or an editor like a publishing house and
11:58
you're going to try to get a traditional
12:00
publishing deal on it you need to look
12:02
at the market and obviously you'll be
12:04
looking at the market differently if
12:05
you're traditionally publishing or if
12:07
you're indie publishing because with
12:09
indie you can publish anything you want
12:11
with traditional they're gonna be
12:12
looking for certain types of things now
12:15
than they were a year ago so you'll need
12:17
to kind of do your research based on
12:19
what your publishing path is most likely
12:21
to be but let's say you're going indie
12:25
what you want to do is you want to go on
12:27
to sites like Amazon or Apple books or
12:29
Google Play Books and look at the top
12:31
100
12:32
look at the top 100 books in your genre
12:35
so if you go say to Google Play and you
12:38
go to sci-fi and fantasy and then you go
12:39
to paranormal because you're writing
12:41
like an urban fantasy or a paranormal
12:43
type book look at those top books look
12:46
at the covers look at some of the blurbs
12:48
and then try to see what's popular right
12:51
now so there's always going to be trends
12:53
so some things are evergreen like
12:55
vampires kind of always sell but
12:57
sometimes they go in and out of fashion
12:58
which is kind of always sell but there
13:01
could be a new trend it's kind of like
13:02
if you look at Amazon right now in
13:04
Kindle unlimited there are a lot of
13:06
Academy style books that are super
13:08
popular sometimes there are books that
13:10
are shifter books or werewolf books are
13:12
specifically popular or like I said
13:14
maybe vampires are making a big comeback
13:16
so whatever it is that's the most
13:18
popular you may want to consider it if
13:21
it's already one of your ideas this is
13:23
something that gets a little bit tricky
13:25
because I personally am NOT someone who
13:27
looks at the market and then decides
13:29
what idea I might have that fits the
13:30
market but I know a lot of people are
13:32
very successful doing that but the ideas
13:34
come to me organically but when I get
13:36
stuck and I say these three ideas I'm so
13:39
excited about and I don't know which
13:40
one's the best to write then if all
13:43
things are equal in terms of my own
13:44
personal joy in writing that story then
13:47
what I look to next is which one's going
13:49
to be probably the most popular with my
13:51
fans with you know people who are just
13:53
general readers which one is most likely
13:55
to sell the best or be the best for my
13:57
career so like I said you can use this
13:59
like evaluating the market to actually
14:02
choose your idea or to formulate your
14:03
idea or if you're like me you'll take
14:06
those ideas that you already loved that
14:09
you've already gone through these other
14:10
Street three steps on and just sort of
14:12
try to decide which one is the most
14:14
marketable because when I think about
14:16
writing to market I think about writing
14:18
the most marketable story that I'm
14:20
excited and would love to write rather
14:22
than just what's the trendiest genre out
14:25
there because I find that writing to
14:26
trends is just not something that I'm
14:28
into it's not something that I think is
14:30
gonna be a long-term choice for me
14:33
because trends come and go but if I can
14:35
choose the most marketable series idea
14:37
that I'm in love with that I'm already
14:40
passionate about that was already an
14:41
organic idea for me then it's a win-win
14:43
situation so look at the market and
14:45
I know some of you may have questions so
14:47
if you have specific questions about how
14:49
do I look at the market how do I analyze
14:51
the market then please let me know this
14:53
is obviously something we go into in
14:55
depth and my publish and thrive course
14:56
that will come back around towards the
14:58
beginning of the year but it's hard to
15:00
cover it in a shorter YouTube video so
15:03
if you have any specific questions leave
15:04
them down below and I'll try my best to
15:06
answer them but basically what you want
15:08
to do is look at all of the vendors and
15:10
ebooks and you could even go into Barnes
15:12
& Noble and look but sometimes what's
15:14
selling and trad publishing is not the
15:15
same as what's selling in Indy so again
15:17
know your path and then make your
15:19
decisions based on that but look at what
15:21
other books in your genre are popular
15:23
and selling and see if any of your your
15:25
ideas that you're already in love with
15:27
sort of fit in with that so let's say
15:29
you go to Apple books and all of the top
15:32
y8 books seem to have some kind of
15:34
horror element to them and they've got
15:37
shifters in some way then you could see
15:39
that if you look at your three ideas
15:42
that you're considering you have a shift
15:44
or horror book so you would think okay
15:46
this would be not only something I
15:48
already know I'm excited about and the
15:49
ideas are flowing and I love but this is
15:52
also something that's likely to sell
15:53
really well and be successful so that's
15:55
tip number four is to consider the
15:57
market tip number five is also a little
15:59
bit controversial and will not be
16:01
something that a lot of you will want to
16:02
try but I'm gonna mention it anyway but
16:04
this is to run your idea by other people
16:07
so high concept if you've ever heard of
16:10
this is something where the minute you
16:12
read about it or the minute somebody
16:14
sees it they think oh I want to watch
16:16
that just off of the title or just a
16:19
quick explanation of what the story is
16:21
makes you feel like you want to read it
16:23
or to watch it because it's just got
16:25
that extra something that taps into a
16:29
universal experience and it's a little
16:31
bit difficult to define high concept but
16:33
that's kind of how I think about it so
16:35
when you're running these say you've
16:37
narrowed it down now after looking at
16:38
the market to two different ideas so
16:41
maybe you want to run these by your
16:42
spouse by your best friend by your
16:44
critique partner or a couple of writing
16:46
buddies I personally wouldn't run it by
16:48
you know a huge Facebook group because
16:50
somebody else is gonna be like oh I want
16:51
that story idea and I'm gonna write that
16:53
but you could run it by people you know
16:56
run
16:56
by people that you know are readers and
16:58
say which one of these ideas really
17:00
sparks your interest more or makes you
17:01
want to read it more and then you'll
17:03
start to get some feedback now I only do
17:06
this again after I've been through those
17:07
other first three steps those first
17:09
three steps are really judging how
17:11
excited you are about it how much you
17:13
want to write the story how much it's
17:15
flowing now you're getting into looking
17:17
at other people you look at the market
17:18
and see how well it would sell you ask
17:20
other people about it you see what they
17:22
might be most interested in but all
17:24
other things being equal this can really
17:26
help you so for example going back to my
17:28
hacked idea I had my sister and her
17:31
partner in a room one time a few years
17:34
ago when I was first coming up with this
17:35
story idea and my sister said oh my gosh
17:38
drop everything and write that right now
17:41
I have to know about it and this was
17:42
just me telling her the same things I
17:44
had just told you guys about it so I
17:46
knew at that point this was a high
17:47
concept idea this was something that a
17:49
lot of people would like and then I ran
17:51
it by another person who said
17:52
essentially the same thing then I ran it
17:54
by one of my beta readers and she said
17:56
the same thing so I knew they were all
17:58
really excited about that story so
18:00
therefore it must be high concept and
18:01
it's more likely to be something that
18:03
appeals to people who already like my
18:05
books so that's another idea now I know
18:07
why I said this is controversial is that
18:09
there going to be some of you out there
18:11
that really subscribe to the idea that
18:13
you shouldn't talk about your story
18:15
ideas and you shouldn't tell anyone else
18:16
because they're gonna steal them or the
18:18
more you talk about it the less excited
18:20
you get about it so that's totally fine
18:21
if you want to skip this one because you
18:23
just don't believe in telling other
18:24
people your story ideas then you do you
18:26
but for those of us who kind of want
18:29
that extra feedback go ahead and get
18:31
that from someone else see which idea
18:33
sort of sparks the most excitement from
18:35
your readers or from people who
18:37
typically like your books or like the
18:39
same things you like so the final tip
18:41
that I have for you number six is to
18:43
just go with your gut instinct so
18:45
sometimes when we're operating on fear
18:48
or we're trying to come up with the most
18:49
sellable thing or like trying to get a
18:51
deal sometimes it's hard for us to
18:54
really hear what our inner voice is
18:56
saying and what our gut instinct is
18:57
telling us so that's why I mentioned all
19:00
those other steps but in the end once
19:02
you've filled out you know your synopsis
19:04
you've judged your own excitement level
19:07
you've written maybe the first couple of
19:08
scenes from the book
19:09
you looked at the market you've talked
19:11
to other people at that point you should
19:13
kind of have some sort of gut instinct
19:17
about which one you most want to right
19:18
and which one's gonna do the best if
19:20
you're choosing between two ideas and
19:22
one seems like it's more sellable and
19:23
the other one you're more excited about
19:25
you're gonna have to decide what your
19:26
priorities are is your priority trying
19:28
to make money on something that you
19:31
really don't know yet is going to make
19:32
money but it just seems like it fits the
19:34
market better or is your priority
19:35
writing something that you're super
19:37
excited about writing and that's gonna
19:38
be super individual to every single
19:40
person watching it I personally want to
19:43
choose the one that's the most exciting
19:46
for me to write but sometimes when you
19:48
know that you're making a living with
19:49
your writing it's really tempting to
19:51
just write the one that seems the most
19:53
marketable but either way you go if
19:56
you've got two great ideas or three
19:59
great ideas that you know are flowing
20:01
that people are excited about that
20:02
you're excited about you can't go wrong
20:04
so just go with your gut instinct one
20:06
way to do this it's like a little way to
20:08
trick yourself is to write each story
20:11
idea or each like tentative title name
20:13
down on an index card fold it a couple
20:16
of times put all three or four whatever
20:18
ideas into a hat and mix them up and
20:20
then pick one and if that story idea
20:23
that comes up makes you feel
20:24
disappointed because you're thinking the
20:26
whole time you're picking oh I hope it's
20:27
the matrix mates Robin Hood I hope it's
20:29
this hacked story then you kind of know
20:31
your gut is telling you that's the one
20:33
you most want to write so just go with
20:35
that one so you can kind of trick
20:37
yourself into figuring out what your gut
20:38
instinct says so the surprise like pick
20:42
one can often help you decide but this
20:44
is some of the process that I go through
20:46
when I'm trying to decide between
20:48
stories and there's just a couple more
20:50
things that I want to say about this
20:52
number one is that if you are already in
20:54
the middle of a series you're what you
20:56
should write next is usually just the
20:58
next book in the series I have made a
21:00
lot of mistakes in my career by saying
21:02
okay I'm gonna go write this other thing
21:04
in this other thing until I had five
21:05
series running at once and that was not
21:08
good for my career and I'm still trying
21:09
to get myself out from under that and
21:11
actually discussing strategy of which
21:13
series you should write next and stuff
21:15
like that could be a pretty huge topic
21:18
that we might go into and it's series at
21:21
some point
21:22
but if you're just starting something
21:24
brand-new a brand new series or brand
21:26
new standalone these are the steps that
21:28
I think will most help you get to that
21:30
magical place where you feel like this
21:32
is the story that I was meant to write
21:33
or this is the story I'm going to write
21:35
so my biggest tips are again write out a
21:38
synopsis of each story see which one has
21:40
the most substance to it number two
21:42
check your excitement level which one
21:44
are you most excited about writing
21:45
number three write out an entire scene
21:47
and see which one has the words flowing
21:50
the best number four look at the market
21:52
analyze the market and see which one
21:54
seems to be the most marketable number
21:56
five run your ideas by a few friends or
21:58
family or readers and see what they
22:00
think see which one gets them most
22:02
excited and if it's unanimous then go
22:04
with that one or number six just put
22:07
them all in a hat pick one and make that
22:10
decision or listen to your gut instinct
22:13
when you're making that choice and see
22:14
which one your gut was telling you I
22:16
really wish it was this one and then
22:18
follow that a hundred percent in the end
22:20
like I said unless you somehow get
22:22
access to a crystal ball or some kind of
22:25
future path and you could go out and see
22:28
okay if I choose option 1 or doorway 2
22:30
or doorway 3 how would my future look
22:32
then you really are never going to know
22:35
which one is the best story so just set
22:38
it up line for yourself and say by this
22:40
date I'm going to pick one and go for it
22:43
but I find that most often when you
22:46
follow your heart and you write the book
22:47
that's most exciting to you that seems
22:50
marketable that is something that really
22:53
just has a lot of conflict has great
22:56
characters the story is just flowing
22:58
that that's usually going to be the best
23:00
choice for you so hopefully these tips
23:02
have resonated with you I hope this is
23:04
going to be helpful helpful for you as
23:06
you go to choose your next story your
23:07
next series or what you're going to
23:09

[Music]
hey everybody welcome back to heart
0:01
breathings it is a deadline week for me
0:04
so please excuse the mess
0:05
and the baby shoes and the messy hair
0:07
but i am so excited to share with you
0:10
my book of master lists but before i go
0:13
into the actual book i want to share
0:15
with you why i think it's so important
0:17
and why it's been so helpful for me
0:19
to make these kinds of lists so just
0:22
keep watching
0:23
[Music]
0:27
so i first got the idea of creating
My Inspiration
0:30
these master lists
0:31
from the brilliant screenwriter and
0:34
author alexandra sokoloff
0:36
she used to be in my local rwa or
0:38
romance writers of america chapter and i
0:40
was lucky enough to hear her speak
0:42
several times on screenwriting tricks
0:45
for authors because she had an amazing
0:47
background in
0:48
screenwriting and then she became a
0:51
multi-best-selling author as well and i
0:53
have learned so much from her
0:54
i highly recommend if you have a chance
0:57
to pick up her
0:58
book stealing hollywood screenwriting
1:00
tricks for authors i believe it's
1:01
currently in kindle unlimited if you're
1:03
in that program and want to read it for
1:05
free
1:05
or you can pick up the paperback i know
1:07
at amazon probably
1:09
elsewhere but i know for sure at amazon
1:11
so i will link that for you down below
1:13
so first of all what am i talking about
1:15
when i say master list
What is a Book of Master Lists?
1:17
so this is basically it can be anything
1:19
you want it to be but the idea
1:21
is to create lists of your favorite
1:24
things
1:24
your top 10 heroines your top 20 books
1:27
of all time that made you cry
1:29

1:32
favorite
1:33
kick-ass heroines your favorite anime
1:36
you could go
1:36
on and on i included a list of ideas
1:40
for your master lists in the
1:42
brainstorming workbook from last week
1:44
if you did not get a chance to download
1:46
the brainstorming workbook
1:48
i do want to quickly apologize that the
1:50
links were kind of messed up to my
1:51
resource library last week my email
1:53
service
1:54
discontinued the use of short links or
1:56
they had some troubles with their short
1:57
links so it messed up all my links but
1:59
it should be working now
2:00
and if you don't have it you can feel
2:02
free to email me and say
2:03
can you help me fix this link from last
2:05
week but it went out to you guys again
2:07

2:08

2:24
like your favorite authors
2:26
your favorite magical creatures your
2:28
favorite romance tropes
2:30
best stories with unreliable narrators
2:32

2:34

2:35

2:37
you on i will show you today some of the
2:39
lists i have made and this is going to
2:41
be a work in progress
2:42
so why create these top 10 top 100
2:46
whatever number you choose
2:48
why create these master lists what alex
Why create one?
2:50
sokoloff says about this
2:52
is it's very simple in order to write
2:55
stories
2:55
like the ones that move you you need to
2:58
look at the specific stories that affect
3:00
you
3:00
and figure out what those authors and
3:02
filmmakers are doing to get
3:04
the effect they do she also says
3:08
if you take the time to study and
3:10
analyze the books and films that have
3:12
had the greatest
3:13
impact on you personally or that are
3:16
structurally similar to the story you're
3:18
writing
3:19
or both that's when you really start to
3:22
master
3:22
your craft this was absolutely true for
3:25
me
3:26
hearing alex speak at my local rwa
3:29
changed my life because she introduced
3:32
me not only to
3:33
the idea of these master lists also
3:36
because she introduced me to three act
3:38
structure in a way that made sense to my
3:40
brain so thank you alex for sharing your
3:42
expertise and your knowledge in a way
3:43
that makes it so easy for us to
3:45
understand
3:46
these master lists though give you a
3:48
chance to really go
3:50
back to the things that you personally
3:52
have always loved
3:53
the things that have turned you on or
3:55
lit you up the things that keep you up
3:57
late at night reading or
3:59
the movies that you come back to and
4:00
watch over and over and over again
4:03
it allows you to mine those memories
4:06
mine those treasures of movies games
4:09
and all that media that you have loved
4:11
in your life so that you can analyze it
4:13
and say
4:14
what is it about this that made me so
4:17
excited
4:17
what is it that inspires me so much what
4:20
did i absolutely love
4:22
about the way that author handled that
4:24
type of heroin
4:25
or that type of scenario or that world
4:27
building what did i love most about that
4:29
and a lot of times answering those types
4:32
of questions is going to also help you
4:33
decide
4:34
what you love to write and the kinds of
4:36
things you want to avoid in your own
4:38
fiction
4:39
and the kinds of things you really want
4:40
to go all in on it also helps you
4:42
analyze that genre because every single
4:45
genre has
4:46
its own things that are typical that
4:48
people expect like when a reader picks
4:50
up a mystery
4:51
they expect a mystery about who killed
4:54
this person or who did the thing right
4:56
and they do expect usually
4:58
to have an answer by the end and if it's
5:00
a police procedural they expect certain
5:02
things
5:03
in that type of book as opposed to a
5:05
psychological mystery or thriller where
5:07
they expect a slightly different
5:09
unfolding of events
5:10
and this really is so much about reader
5:12
expectations
5:13
and believe me if you want to sell books
5:16
you need to understand
5:17
your reader's expectations it doesn't
5:20
mean you can't play around with those
5:22
things but if you don't know the rules
5:24
and you don't know what readers are
5:25
expecting when they pick up your kind of
5:27
novel
5:28
a historical romance a psychological
5:31
thriller
5:31
a young adult fantasy if you don't know
5:34
what other things exist
5:36
in that genre and what readers are
5:37
coming to the table expecting
5:39
you're going to have a very hard time
5:42
pulling off
5:42
anything that goes too far or strays too
5:46
far from the norm
5:47
if you do it with intention because you
5:48
deeply understand
5:50
what your readers expect and you're
5:51
leading them a certain way on purpose
5:53
you can be extremely brilliant and very
5:55
successful
5:56
but if you've never really consumed
5:58
fiction of this kind before and you go
6:00
into it with no idea of what your
6:02
readers are expecting
6:03
you can end up with some really bad
6:05
reviews and some really bad sales
6:07
really analyzing and digging deep on
6:10
these types of master lists
6:11
and understanding what it is that you
6:13
love most so that you can
6:15
come up with your own twists this is not
6:17
about copying anyone else
6:19
it's about having a deep and true
6:21
understanding of the craft
6:23
and the way that certain types of
6:24
stories are put together the way certain
6:26
types of
6:27
worlds are built there are a million
6:29
books you can read i highly recommend
6:31
alex's that focus on
6:33
craft itself but truly the best way to
6:36
learn
6:37
and to truly deeply know and understand
6:39
story structure
6:40
and the way things are done is to study
6:42
your own
6:43
master lists the things that really
6:45
light you up the things that you have
6:47
loved in your
6:48
life before so that being said i am
6:50
going to introduce you to
6:52
my own book of master lists and i'm
6:54
going to show you a bit inside
A look inside my Book of Master Lists
6:56
okay so let's dive in i know i will get
6:58
questions about what this notebook
7:00
is it is a mcqualrius notebook that i
7:04
got from staples literally
7:05
like 14 years ago i am not gonna lie
7:08
i will talk about that a little bit in
7:10
my upcoming may notebook challenge but
7:12
this is one of the notebooks i have
7:14
probably held on to for the longest
7:16
because it is so big i don't know for
7:18
sure how many pages are in this but this
7:20
has to be at least 500 pages in this
7:22
notebook it is all graph paper
7:24
and i have never felt like i had a big
7:27
enough thing
7:28
to put in it and i wanted to be able to
7:31
use it all the way up
7:32
so i could not find this exact notebook
7:35
on
7:35
the staples website but i did find a
7:37
similar one on amazon
7:39
that i will link for you down below and
7:41
then of course i covered it in stickers
7:43
from
7:43
redbubble which i kind of went over in
7:45
my recent haul video if you'd like to
7:46
see that
7:47
but it doesn't really matter what
7:49
notebook you use i just would recommend
7:51
getting one that is big enough that you
7:53
can add
7:54
to it quite a bit over time if you plan
7:56
on
7:57
this being like your central masterless
8:00
notebook for the rest of your career
8:02
but no pressure i just recently started
8:05
this notebook i really wish that when i
8:08
had heard alex speak
8:09
before i had even written my first novel
8:11
so this was probably 13 years ago
8:14
when i first heard her speak i wish i
8:15
had created a notebook like this because
8:17
instead
8:18
what i did with my master list was put
8:20
them on like yellow notebook paper and
8:21
then i would do all my analysis and
8:23
watch all the things and
8:25
go through the process of seeing what i
8:26
loved about something and then i would
8:28
recycle those pages
8:29
and i would give a million dollars right
8:31
now if i could have all those old pages
8:33
back for what inspired my beautiful
8:35
demon series and more
8:36
but i can't so i highly recommend that
8:38
you go ahead and start your master list
8:40
notebook
8:41
in something that you can keep forever
8:44
so
8:44
let me show you inside i had written
8:46
this sarah maria cannon when i first got
8:48
this so this is kind of old school but i
8:50
think i will cover this
8:52
with a collage so stay tuned on how that
8:54
develops
8:55
i also just created a little title page
8:58
here that says book of master lists
9:00
that has a quote from linus pauling the
9:02
best way to have a good idea
9:04
is to have a lot of ideas i also took a
9:08
page here to say
9:09
what my intentions are i'm wanting to
9:11
put together a master list of all these
9:13
things so that
9:14
i can really figure out what i love most
9:17
i can keep notes on all of the anime the
9:20
series the books and so on that i read
9:21
and
9:22
consume so for me this is also going to
9:24
be kind of like a diary
9:26
of the things that i watch which is why
9:28
i personally wanted such a big notebook
9:30
and i'll show you kind of more about
9:32
that as we go on
9:33
but i've set forth my intentions just so
9:35
i would
9:36
kind of be clear about that i also
9:38
because this is going to be a massive
9:40
notebook i'm going to use
9:42
tabs and things to help keep track of
9:44
where i am in the book
9:46
but i also decided i would probably want
9:48
some kind of index so that i could
9:50
quickly turn to what i was looking for
9:52
so you can see as i get a little bit
9:54
deeper in
9:54
i also started numbering the pages so
9:57
that i could create an
9:58
index based on those page numbers and i
10:01
gave myself several pages to
10:04
keep up with that then the very first
10:07
spread so to speak is a list of
10:10
ideas that light me up and basically
10:13
this is what some people will call your
10:15
id
10:16
it's the things that you just naturally
10:17
become drawn to
10:19
in fiction so for me it's things like
10:21
when colors are used in magic or when
10:23
you use elemental magic
10:24
like things that are based on water
10:26
earth fire air
10:28
i love that type of magic i love colors
10:31
in magic when you've got
10:32
a blue gemstone means something
10:34
different from a red gemstone
10:36
i always love those kinds of things or
10:38
potions that mean different things
10:39
because of the color i love it in games
10:41
and i love it in fiction
10:43
so i've got that here i also love
10:45
characters that you hate
10:47
until you know their story and then you
10:48
get to know them and you love them that
10:50
kind of twist of that type of character
10:52
i love toying with memories and memory
10:55
loss when things are like flashback that
10:57
you can't remember
10:58
things like memento where the story is
10:59
put together strangely until it comes to
11:01
the truth i love stuff like that as well
11:04
i love the kind of trope of no one
11:05
believes you that you know it's true but
11:08
you can't prove it so maybe you're crazy
11:10
some stuff like gothica which also goes
11:12
into ghosts and ghostly figures
11:14
i also love things like is this a
11:16
psychological horror
11:17
or is there really something
11:19
supernatural going on like gothica like
11:21
i just mentioned
11:22
i love dark forests or old haunted
11:24
houses now
11:26
obviously i have not filled this out
11:27
completely because i wanted to just give
11:29
you something that i could start with
11:30
and i probably
11:32
will fill this in and then continue to
11:34
make
11:35
further lists deeper in if you're
11:37
wondering how i made these perfect
11:39
little dots
11:40
also i wanted to mention that i love
11:42
these for list makings this is the zig
11:44
clean color dot markers and they have
11:47
just this little tip here that you can
11:48
just press down and create a perfect
11:50
little dot
11:51
another set of these that i have are
11:54
called
11:54
the play color dots from tombow but i
11:57
will say that these are not rounded
11:59
and they don't make as perfect of a
12:01
little circle
12:02
i think as these but they do come in
12:05
more colors you can kind of hopefully
12:07
see that all the different colors so
12:09
just a little accessory if you're
12:10
stationary obsessed like i am that you
12:12
might want to use for your list
12:15
so i highly recommend that you make a
12:17
list of
12:18
the things that you're naturally drawn
12:20
to not tied to any specific series or
12:22
anything like that but if you just love
12:24
any story about twins or you love
12:26
romances where it's enemies to lovers
12:29
and that's your favorite type of romance
12:30
put those things down
12:32
because that will help you understand
12:33
what types of things you love most
12:35
and may give you ideas for what you most
12:37
want to write
12:39
i also have started my master list and
12:42
i'm going to add
12:42
collages on the side as well as probably
12:45
some
12:46
little notes here about why i loved some
12:49
of these things that i loved
12:51
and so i also throughout this have
12:53
started creating these little vellum
12:55
sheets with
12:56
images that i've gotten from the
12:57
internet just to kind of add some
13:00
flair to my notebook of course this is
13:02
just extra but
13:04
it makes me happy so top 10 zombie
13:06
stories for example
13:08
and some of these like left 4 dead
13:11
are games some are television shows no i
13:14
did not read
13:14
the comic book so for me it's a tv show
13:17
some of them
13:18
are serious some of them are funnier
13:20
like shawn of the dead
13:21
some of them are books news flesh or
13:23
some of them are
13:24
movies like 28 days later some of them
13:28
were not zombies originally in the books
13:30
but are in the movies
13:31
so it's kind of a mix of things
13:34
i also have my top anime
13:37
and yes i know because people will
13:39
comment on the things that i like
13:41
that avatar last and airbender is not
13:43
technically an anime but it goes on my
13:45
list because it's one of my favorite
13:47
animated series if you recognize this is
13:50
lynn
13:50
from the gun gale online version of
13:53
sword art online which is my favorite
13:54
anime
13:57
and i will mention to you that it's not
13:59
like you have these top 10 or 11 things
14:02
and then you can never add to it in the
14:04
future like later
14:05
i can tip in more that i loved i can
14:08
change this list i can
14:10
later on in the notebook say my updated
14:12
2025 list of favorite animes
14:14
because as i consume more i'm going to
14:17
maybe change which ones i love most or
14:19
as i change as a human
14:20
maybe the things i love will change i
14:24
also have
14:24
my favorite unreliable narrators now
14:27
these are
14:27
from books some of them were also made
14:30
into movies
14:31
but these are mostly inspired by the
14:33
books and i left a couple spaces here
14:35
because i couldn't decide between a few
14:37
that really belonged
14:39
in my top 10 list so i'm holding off on
14:41
those
14:42
and then i've also left just a few pages
14:45
here for other top 10
14:46
style lists that i want to add so i just
14:49
you know
14:49
left space for that i also plan to make
14:52
a spread
14:53
about my favorite game of all time where
14:55
i met my husband
14:56
and spent i used to play this game like
14:58
it was my job
14:59
back when i was a school teacher and
15:01
didn't have like all this marketing and
15:03
promo to do and my life is very
15:04
different life and no kids
15:06
i used to play everquest 2 with my
15:09
future husband george
15:10
and i would play it literally from the
15:12
time i got home every day until like one
15:15
in the morning and then saturday
15:16
mornings
15:17
all weekend and i loved it and it was a
15:19
huge part of my life and it inspires a
15:21
lot of my fiction
15:22
so i want to do an entire segment of my
15:24
notebook here about what i loved about
15:26
that game and why
15:27
i've loved it more than some other games
15:29
that i loved i probably also will do
15:32
a spread on final fantasy and maybe a
15:34
few other things that i have loved along
15:36
the way
15:36
now i'll show you something else that
15:39
i'm doing with this notebook
15:40
and this is optional but i i think i
15:42
have been searching for a place to
15:44
really keep track of the things that i'm
15:46
watching and what i think of them
15:48
and i think this will be the perfect
15:49
place because then all of these notes
15:51
will be kept in the same
15:53
notebook now if you had a smaller
15:55
notebook i you could maybe keep
15:57
what you're watching separate from the
15:58
things that are your favorites
16:00
but i like this so we
16:04
started watching the show back when it
16:05
was first airing like i don't know gosh
16:07
early 2000s maybe 2000
16:10
7 8 i don't remember 2010 but we stopped
16:13
at season five so now we're finishing it
16:15
up so we watch season six season seven
16:17
i also recommend having some white out
16:19
because if you're like me you're gonna
16:21
make mistakes
16:23
and we're currently watching season
16:24
eight so i'm going to
16:27
mark some things that i liked about this
16:28
show i also have read some of the books
16:31
and so i want to kind of talk about what
16:33
i like about this
16:35
type of hero in particular
16:38
we also have been watching lord of the
16:40
rings we watched all three of these with
16:42
our son andrew and so i was marking some
16:45
of my favorite lines or moments i also
16:47
have a list here of
16:49
the things from this series that really
16:51
spark my imagination things i would like
16:53
to duplicate or
16:54
replicate i guess in my own fiction like
16:56
i love ancient ruins
16:58
with their own names like castles that
17:01
were destroyed that used to have their
17:02
own name
17:03
or places of great power that have
17:05
fallen into ruin i really like this idea
17:07
and would like to use it in more of my
17:09
fiction
17:10
so also similar to the wheel of time
17:13
it starts out with this peaceful village
17:15
like life on the outskirts these people
17:17
that are very happy with who they are in
17:19
their simple lives
17:20
where they don't really have a lot of
17:21
outside interference but
17:24
adventure comes calling them away into
17:26
danger and i really like that kind of
17:28
thing
17:28
so just those kind of ideas keeping
17:31
track
17:32
of the tropes or the things that you
17:33
loved most the things that ignite your
17:35
imagination and make you
17:37
excited for what you could write in your
17:39
own way in your own fiction
17:41
so i've left more space to talk about
17:42
that series
17:44
then i also have created some wish lists
17:47
here
17:48
so i have not only my favorite anime but
17:51
the anime i want to watch so black
17:54
butler is at the top of my list i've
17:55
been wanting to watch fairy tale for a
17:57
long time george has seen that one
17:59
but it's really long and i've just never
18:01
had time but it's on my list
18:03
cowboy bebop hell girl no game no life
18:06
which is what this is from
18:07
and we're actually currently watching
18:09
that i also have
18:11
an unreliable narrator wish list if you
18:13
have any suggestions i will definitely
18:15
be reading the comments over the next
18:16
weeks or so
18:17
so if you have suggestions on your
18:19
favorite unreliable narrators or anime
18:21
you think i should absolutely watch
18:23
go ahead and leave those in the comments
18:25
below i have this quote that i took from
18:28
gone girl should i remove my soul before
18:30
i come inside
18:32
amy dunn so i've got that and i probably
18:35
will just continue because i love
18:36
unreliable narrators then we've got
18:40
avatar the last airbender like i said
18:42
this is one of my favorite animated
18:44
series i know that many people say it
18:45
doesn't qualify as an anime which is
18:47
fine
18:48
but we started watching this again on
18:50
the 17th
18:51
to introduce andrew our almost
18:53
nine-year-old to the series and he is
18:55
really liking it
18:56
and they're only about 23 minutes which
18:58
is about how much time we have so when
18:59
we were watching lord of the rings
19:01
we had to watch it in pieces so this we
19:03
can watch at least one episode every
19:05
night so it'll take us a little ways to
19:07
get through it but i think it'll be fun
19:09
and this of course avatar has that earth
19:12
air water fire type
19:13
magic that i will potentially be using
19:16
in an upcoming series so it's good to
19:18
have a re-watch of that
19:21
so that is the whole of my notebook that
19:24
i have started
19:25
so far so hopefully that gives you some
19:28
ideas about what you might want to do in
19:29
your own
19:30
book of master lists but another thing
Inspiration for my Works in Progress
19:33
that i intend to do that i have not set
19:34
up yet
19:35
one is to take my own book so i've just
19:39
printed one of my book covers
19:41
on sticker paper so i would likely do
19:44
something like i'm probably going to
19:45
skip a few pages because i know that i
19:47
want
19:47
to put some notes about avatar on there
19:50
also think about what kind of notebook
19:52
you really enjoy if you want to do
19:54
something like this you could also just
19:56
do it in
19:57
digital format if that makes like notion
19:59
we were talking about notion earlier on
20:01
this channel
20:01
notion would be a great place to keep
20:03
all of these notes if you don't like a
20:05
physical notebook
20:06
but i love my notebooks this one does
20:08
not lay flat though so i'll have to
20:10
break it in a little bit more
20:12
but this is the witch's door my new
20:14
cover for this book which
20:16
this book probably won't be coming out
20:18
until next year
20:19
but i will probably do
20:22
things like this where i will take a
20:24
series or an upcoming
20:26
novel and especially if i know i've got
20:29
some time before it's going to be coming
20:31
out
20:31
or before i'm going to be working on it
20:34
and i will create
20:34
little spreads for it then what i'm
20:37
going to do
20:38
is i'm going to keep notes
20:42
on this page or on this spread or maybe
20:45
a few pages
20:46
as to what other types of heroin so i
20:49
might make a list of heroines that
20:51
remind me of lenny in this or i might
20:54
make a list of
20:56
other young adult paranormal or
20:57
supernatural books that also have
21:00
witches that i might draw some
21:02
inspiration from especially witches like
21:04
lenny who use a lot of reagents or have
21:06
spell cabinets or
21:07
create potions or work with cauldrons um
21:10
there are also certain kinds of key
21:12
magic in this that i might want to use
21:14
or portal magic
21:15
so having some of the other types of
21:18
films or books that i have specifically
21:21
wanted to
21:22
explore or analyze in relation to this
21:24
character that might inspire me
21:26
will go on this sheet and i think that
21:28
that will help me because then when i
21:30
want to get into the mood of writing
21:31
this series
21:32
i'll just be able to visit this spread
21:34
and say oh my gosh
21:36
yes i need to go back and watch that
21:37
movie or i need to go back and read some
21:39
parts of that book
21:40
that really stuck with me about that
21:42
heroin because my heroine is similar
21:44
and again i really want to drive at home
21:46
that this is not about copying this is
21:48
just about drawing
21:49
inspiration from the masters the people
21:52
that you have loved the people that made
21:54
you feel like you wanted to be a writer
21:56
then you can draw from their knowledge
21:58
and do it your own way
22:00
but using inspiration that you've gained
22:02
from things that you've loved in the
22:03
past
22:04
so this is another type of spread so
22:06
i've got my master lists of inspiration
22:09
i've got my currently watching type
22:12
spreads or some of my favorites type
22:14
spreads
22:15
then i also will have my current work in
22:18
progress or future books
22:19
that will have their own spreads and
22:22
things that i loved about those
22:23
the other thing that i will probably do
22:25
and this is similar to the like
22:27
currently watching
22:28
spread but rather than tv episodes or
22:31
things like that
22:32
what i would like to do since i was
22:34
talking about gothica
22:36
so gothica is kind of an older movie
22:39
with halle berry i love it it's
22:41
unreliable narrator it's psychological
22:43
but it's also
22:44
supernatural or is it like is this all
22:46
in her head or is it supernatural
22:48
it's a really really good movie it does
22:50
have some darker themes i think it's
22:52
still on netflix
22:53
so if you want to check some trigger
22:55
warnings on that you might want to
22:56
because it does have some
22:58
some darker themes i will be writing a
23:00
story that is
23:01
inspired by that one in some ways called
23:03
the possession of mira black
23:05
and it is very much a young adult
23:07
version of
23:08
a girl who gets put into a mental
23:10
institution and you don't know
23:12
if it's really some kind of supernatural
23:15
thing going on or if it's all in her
23:17
mind and so i probably will make a
23:19
spread about gothica
23:21
and then what i would do is i would
23:23
actually go in and write
23:24
act one you know for those of you that
23:27
have followed me for a while you know
23:28
that i have
23:29
a plotting workbook in my free resources
23:32
where i go through
23:33
all the different plot points like the
23:35
hook the setting
23:36
act one climax the inciting incident and
23:39
things like that
23:39
so what i would do is maybe take that
23:42
plotting notebook
23:44
scale it down to size print it out and
23:46
put it into these pages or just redraw
23:49
it for myself
23:50
and then i would take that movie apart
23:52
pausing it stopping it
23:54
looking at it and saying what's the hook
23:55
here what's the act one climax what was
23:58
the inciting incident
23:59
what's the pinch point and look at all
24:01
those plot points for that movie then i
24:04
might take another movie
24:05
that i would use to inspire that
24:08
particular book the possession of mira
24:09
black
24:10
and i would analyze that and then after
24:12
i'm done analyzing those and keeping
24:14
track of the analysis
24:15
of where was the act one climack and
24:18
climax and so forth
24:19
then i can maybe start working on my own
24:22
ideas of what do i want to do
24:23
similarly what type of feel how did they
24:26
get that feel that they were looking for
24:28
and that is going to help me truly
24:30
master my own craft by seeing how other
24:32
people did it
24:33
one of the most pivotal things i did
24:36
when i was first learning story
24:38
structure for myself and learning how to
24:40
be
24:40
a writer is taking those exact things
24:43
that plotting type notebook
24:45
and watching other films and reading
24:47
other books
24:48
and then trying to analyze where was the
24:50
act one climax where was the midpoint
24:52
what happened at the black moment and
24:54
when i could identify those plot points
24:57
then i started to have such a deeper
24:58
understanding
24:59
than i did when i was just reading books
25:01
on craft so i highly recommend
25:03
this type of notebook not only as a way
Remember your Passions
25:06
to get to know and really explore the
25:08
things that you
25:09
as a writer love because i truly believe
25:12
that your best work will come through
25:15
the things that you most love to write
25:17
not the things you think you're going to
25:18
make the most money at or the things
25:20
somebody else told you should write
25:21
because you'll make money doing it
25:23
but i think your greatest success will
25:24
come from the things that you truly
25:26
love but if you want that success you
25:29
need to understand
25:30
what makes you love those things what
25:33
how did that author or that creator get
25:35
you to feel the way that you felt and
25:37
then how can you recreate that
25:38
and once you analyze and truly
25:40
understand how it all works
25:42
you're going to become a master of the
25:44
craft and
25:45
everybody has their own things they love
25:47
their own things that light them up so
25:49
the more you study that
25:51
the better you will get at it so that is
25:53
our look at my
25:54
book of master lists and don't forget
25:56
that even though we had those issues
25:58
with the links
25:59
this brainstorming great ideas and other
26:02
workbooks to come as well as that
26:04

26:07

26:09

[Music]
hey everyone welcome back to heart
0:01
breathings i'm very excited to share
0:03
with you a
0:04
series of videos that i have been
0:06
working on for quite some time
0:08
i'm calling this the great ideas series
0:11
because it is all about
0:12
coming up with great ideas how to choose
0:15
between ideas how to stick
0:16
to one idea until you make it all the
0:18
way to the end and so much more
0:20
so today in our first video in this
0:23
series we're going to be talking about
0:24
tips for brainstorming and different
0:27
methods that you can use for
0:28
brainstorming that might be really fun
0:30
i also have created a special
0:31
brainstorming great ideas workbook that
0:33
you can download for free
0:34
so if you're interested in learning how
0:37
to brainstorm
0:38
great ideas and some new methods that
0:39
you might not have tried before
0:41
just stay tuned
0:46
so if you guys have been around the
0:47
heart breathing community for a while
0:49
you know that i love to create
0:50
longer video series sometimes where we
0:52
stick to one topic but cover lots of
0:55
different aspects
0:56
so that we can go deeper into one
0:58
subject rather than just kind of
0:59
glossing over the surface
1:00
and a lot of the questions that i get
1:02
asked from time to time
1:03
are about great ideas how do you come up
1:06
with ideas how do you
1:07
keep track of your ideas how do you find
1:09
inspiration
1:11
how do you stick to one idea until it's
1:13
done instead of constantly getting
1:15
distracted which is a huge problem for
1:17
most of us
1:18
as well as how do you choose between
1:20
ideas if you have lots of great ideas
1:21
which one do you write
1:23
so we're going to have a at least seven
1:25
part series
1:26
all about great ideas and all of those
1:28
topics that we just talked about
1:30

1:32

2:31
hardee's
2:32
newsletter okay so let's talk about
2:34
brainstorming
2:35
basically the process of brainstorming
2:37
is just getting all of your ideas out of
2:39
your mind and even pushing yourself to
2:41
think of new
2:42
and unusual and interesting things that
2:44
you really need to
2:45
kind of get your most basic ideas down
2:48
on paper and then push yourself to come
2:50
up with things that may have a better
2:51
hook or something that's a little bit
2:53
more original or something that really
2:55
is going to grab your reader's attention
2:56
but there are some fun ways
2:58
to not only kind of open your mind to
3:01
the brainstorming process
3:02
but there are some methods that you
3:04
might want to use now this video is only
3:06
going to go over five but there are tons
3:08
of great brainstorming methods so if you
3:09
have a tried and true
3:11
brainstorming method like mind mapping
3:13
or word mapping that you like to use
3:15
when you come up with your ideas
3:16
share them down below especially if i
3:18
don't mention them here in this video
3:20
now when we talk about
3:21
great ideas there are really two things
3:23
that i think we're talking about
3:25
one is does it make you excited is it
3:28
something that ignites and sparks your
3:30
own
3:30
imagination and this is going to come
3:32
into play in your actual process is
3:34
knowing
3:35
what lights you up and number two is it
3:37
something that other people are going to
3:39
be excited to read
3:40
is it something that is high concept or
3:42
something that is universally
3:44
interesting to a lot of people or is it
3:46
something similar to what's been on the
3:48
market before but with your own twist
3:50
so we're going to cover what makes an
3:52
idea great and what high concept means
3:54
in a future video
3:55
today we're going to talk mainly about
3:57
five brainstorming tips how to get
3:59
yourself in the mood
4:00
and then five proven methods that have
4:02
been the ones that work best for me
4:03
so let's get started so the first tip
Open Your Mind
4:06
that i have for you is really
4:07
to get yourself into a state of having
4:09
and totally open mind
4:11
that means really sit down with
4:13
intention and think
4:14
i'm not going to judge any idea nothing
4:16
that i say here or put down on paper is
4:19
a bad idea nothing's stupid nothing is
4:22
worthless
4:22
nothing is done too often or too unique
4:25
there's no judgment at all
4:27
having an open mind is one of the best
4:30
and most crucial ways to truly have a
4:32
productive brainstorming session
4:34
you are going to have ideas that are
4:36
just like where did that come from
4:37
a bat that shifts into a human who you
4:40
know is a vampire like who knows
4:42
where did that idea come from yes you
4:44
were going to have some ideas along the
4:45
way that are like
4:46
way out in left field and probably would
4:49
never make a great book but that's how
4:50
you get to the good stuff you have to
4:53
keep mining for it's kind of like if
4:55
you've got this pickaxe
4:56
that you're just constantly going
4:57
through all these rocks and eventually
4:59
there's going to be a
5:00
little nugget of gold that you can use
5:02
in your story so don't be afraid
5:04
of the just like worthless rocks and
5:06
dirt and mud and worms that you're going
5:08
to find along the way
5:09
because that's how you get to the good
5:10
stuff so whatever ways you can think of
5:13
methods you can think of to really open
5:15
your mind because if you censor what
5:17
you're saying what you're thinking
5:19
it's like you're throwing up walls to
5:20
great ideas and you never know what
5:22
might be
5:22
on the opposite side when george and i
5:25
are my husband george and i
5:26
are brainstorming ideas for plot we
5:29
sometimes will come through some of the
5:30
dumbest things and some of the things he
5:32
suggests are things i would never write
5:33
in my story
5:34
but that stupid idea sorry george sparks
5:38
something really awesome because it's
5:39
like no not that but what about this
5:41
and sometimes that's just a chain
5:43
reaction so you have to be willing to
5:45
have the bad
5:46
ideas and not throw up walls of judgment
5:48
along the way
5:49
my second tip for great brainstorming
Keep Track of Everything
5:51
session is to keep track of everything
5:53
so i have a notebook where i keep all of
5:55
my notes but you could use a digital
5:57
file you could use a google doc you
5:59
could use notion
6:00
but keep all your ideas what i used to
6:03
always do
6:04
is have like a small notebook or a note
6:07
card or some sticky notes and i would
6:09
write ideas as i was brainstorming
6:11
but what inevitably happened over the
6:13
course of years and moving
6:14
is i lost those ideas i had one great
6:17
brainstorming session a few years ago
6:19
where i literally wrote out the plot
6:20
like the overarching plot for 10
6:22
different novels and i could never find
6:25
it again it's in some notebooks that
6:27
probably got thrown out or recycled
6:29
and it's gone forever so i highly
6:31
recommend that you come up with a system
6:33
and again we're gonna have another video
6:34
on this
6:35
later in the series so make sure you're
6:37
subscribed
6:38
but i recommend having a specific
6:40
notebook that you
6:41
use as your main brainstorming notebook
6:44
where you keep all your ideas
6:46
we're gonna actually talk about how to
6:48
create something like that in next
6:49
week's video
6:50
this is my brainstorming or book of
6:54
master lists
6:55
and inspiration so i'm gonna have an
6:56
entire video on this notebook but i
6:58
recommend that you have one place where
7:00
you keep all your ideas and you keep
7:02
them organized and
7:03
in a place you can find them instead of
7:05
like little notes throughout the
7:06
house i actually specifically have been
7:08
using a samsung
7:10
note phone for years because it has that
7:12
little
7:13
pen stylus in the phone and i can just
7:15
take it out and write it any moment and
7:17
i always have it there in my google doc
7:19
but whatever system you come up with
7:20
just make sure it's consistent
Pick a Partner
7:22
tip number three is to pick a great
7:24
brainstorming partner
7:25
i find that brainstorming can be so much
7:28
more fun and it can really get you
7:30
out of your own mind and start pushing
7:31
you and challenging you to create new
7:33
ideas
7:34
when you have a great partner to bounce
7:36
those ideas off of
7:37
especially if that partner also enjoys
7:40
the same genre that you write
7:41
or they have a lot of knowledge of story
7:43
lines and tropes and things like that
7:45
it can make it so much more fun however
7:48
i really recommend that you don't pick a
7:50
partner who
7:51
is super judgmental or critical because
7:53
if every idea you throw out they're like
7:55
well that's stupid that's just like
7:56
twilight
7:57
just let them go that is not the right
7:59
partner for you you want a partner who's
8:01
going to be excited
8:02
and have that same open mind energy that
8:04
you have
8:05
but that we'll be able to throw in some
8:07
good ideas along the way
8:08
my fourth tip is to get yourself in the
Get in the Zone
8:11
zone
8:12
get into a space of creative flow
8:14
sometimes what this means for me is to
8:16
do something else creative
8:18
not just you know opening my mind like i
8:21
talked about
8:22
but actually getting down and doing some
8:23
zentangle or
8:25
doing a little bit of coloring or doing
8:27
some
8:28
like watching one of my favorite
8:30
episodes of a show that really inspires
8:31
me or getting on some really good music
8:33
going for a walk and starting to get
8:35
into
8:35
that creative flow art journaling has
8:38
been a favorite way of mine to get into
8:40
creative flow lately so get yourself
8:42
into that creative space where you have
8:43
lots of time to really think don't plan
8:46
your brainstorming session if you can
8:48
avoid it in just like a 30 minute
8:49
session where you have to go very fast
8:51
because you're never going to get into
8:53
that relaxed freedom
8:55
creative vibe flow and in fact if you're
8:58
trying to brainstorm like a new series
9:00
that's going to be something you write
9:01
for the next decade of your life
9:03
maybe even try to go on a retreat or
9:05
allow yourself an
9:06
entire weekend to just immerse in these
9:08
ideas and plan activities for getting
9:11
into creative flow
9:12
because that is going to be a super
9:14
important brainstorming session
9:15
i am down to the last two books of my
9:17
best-selling series
9:19
the shadow demon saga i'm currently
9:20
working on book 11 and i
9:22
have a feeling that i will finish this
9:23
series this year in 2021
9:26
so i'm already thinking big of like
9:28
what's my next long
9:29
10 12 book series so that's gonna be an
9:32
epic brainstorming session and i'll
9:34
probably try to get away for an entire
9:36
weekend to do that brainstorming my
HAVE FUN!
9:37
fifth tip for having a great
9:39
brainstorming session is really and
9:40
truly just have fun
9:42
this is no pressure don't put the
9:44
pressure of yourself of like i have to
9:46
make it a good series that people are
9:47
going to love this has to be something
9:48
an agent is going to want to buy
9:50
don't put all that pressure on yourself
9:52
just have a good time
9:53
think about the stories that really
9:55
light you up that would be fun for you
9:56
to write things that just
9:58
make you like oh i'm so excited to write
10:00
that get into that vibe
10:02
not the like needy vibe of this book has
10:05
to sell or we're going to lose our house
10:07
like
10:07
even if that is true try to let go of
10:09
that as best you can
10:10
and say what's going to be fun for me
10:13
because i promise you the more fun
10:15
you're having writing it the more fun
10:16
readers you're going to have reading
10:18
and consuming it so writing something
10:20
you love having fun with the
10:21
brainstorming session is super important
10:23
okay so that first half of the video was
10:25
all about tips for getting in the mood
10:27
and having a good brainstorming session
10:29
but now we're going to talk about five
10:30
methods i love to use
10:32
to really bring up all the ideas like
10:34
actual
10:35
tasks and exercises but i will say there
10:39
are tons
10:40
more you could search here on youtube
10:41
you can search on google or pinterest
10:43
there's word mapping and word
10:45
associations there's all kinds of
10:47
different
10:48
brainstorming methods that you might
10:49
want to use but i'm going to go over my
10:51
top five and feel free to share your
10:53
favorites
10:53
in the comments with the community and
10:55
remember that i do have
10:57
this workbook that i made for you that
10:59
lists all of these types of
11:00
brainstorming methods and gives you some
11:02
exercises and worksheets to fill out to
11:04
get you started so don't forget to
11:06
download that for free
11:07
at the link below so the first one is to
Create a Book of Master Lists
11:10
keep
11:11
a book of master lists and inspiration
11:14
so this is something i actually just
11:16
recently created because i have been
11:18
wanting to do this for a long time and i
11:19
have been keeping this
11:20
in different notebooks like i said
11:22
different places google drive docs
11:24
and it's been kind of scattered but i
11:26
highly recommend
11:28
creating one central place one notebook
11:31
that you keep
11:31
all of your master lists so let's talk
11:34
about what a master list
11:35
is a master list is basically it could
11:37
be a top 10 list a top 100 list but it's
11:40
just
11:40
a laundry list basically of your
11:43
favorite things
11:44
so remember i was talking about things
11:45
that light you up and get you excited
11:47
if you for example were going to be
11:49
writing a zombie series you knew you
11:51
wanted something that was like
11:52
badass post-apocalyptic zombie stuff
11:55
then maybe what you would do is sit down
11:57
and make a list of all of your favorite
11:59
zombie games zombie television shows
12:02
books
12:02
movies everything you've ever consumed
12:04
about zombies that has inspired you in
12:06
the past
12:07
then if you want to take it a stage
12:09
further you can take that list of your
12:11
favorites
12:11
and then start figuring out what do they
12:13
have in common and analyzing
12:15
what types of heroines or heroes are in
12:17
these what types of tropes do you see
12:19
every single time that you can play with
12:21
that would be fun
12:22
and that type of thing simply just
12:24
sitting down and making a list
12:26
top 10 favorite heroines top 10 favorite
12:29
animes
12:30
top 5 10 favorite opening lines or magic
12:33
systems
12:34
there are tons of different things that
12:35
you can use especially if you already
12:37
kind of
12:38
know what genre you want to write or
12:40
what types of books inspire you
12:42
make a master list of your top 10
12:44
favorite authors or favorite series
12:46
and start to put together the pieces of
12:48
what
12:49
inspires me about them what did these
12:51
have in common what
12:52
pieces of this were my favorite scenes
12:54
and how can i write something similar in
12:56
my own voice
12:57
or how can i get inspired by these 10
13:00
films to write something that's going to
13:01
be really fun for me
13:03
and that is one of my favorite ways to
13:04
brainstorm and it's not something that
13:07
you just have to do in a weekend
13:08
this is something you can keep up with
13:10
for years and years to come
13:11
that you continue to create these lists
13:14
so in the workbook that i have for you i
13:16
have an entire list of suggestions
13:18
of lists that you can create and i find
13:21
this to be
13:21
super helpful in inspiring me and
13:24
figuring out what types of things
13:25
i love and what types of things are in
13:28
my id
13:28
so to speak if we want to go freudian
13:30
what types of things are really
13:32
just naturally light me up for some
13:34
reason like twins or magical talismans
13:37
or color coding
13:38
things like that those things really
13:40
excite me and i like to use them in my
13:42
fiction
13:42
next week i am actually going to give
13:44
you a tour of this and we're going to
13:46
talk through it
13:47
and i'll show you a little bit more
13:49
about how to create that and we'll go
13:50
into more detail
13:51
but that's one of my best brainstorming
13:53
methods is to have those lists
13:55
and then start pulling things from them
13:57
and bouncing ideas
13:59
and using that kind of as a springboard
14:01
for new ideas to come to me
Play the "What If..." Game
14:02
brainstorming method number two which is
14:04
of course tried and true is to play
14:06
the what if game this is basically just
14:08
taking any type of prompt
14:11
and letting your imagination fly what if
14:14
you woke up tomorrow and dot dot dot
14:17
there are so many movies and
14:19
books that come from this what if you
14:21
woke up tomorrow and
14:22
the whole world was different what if
14:24
you woke up 28 days
14:26
later out of a coma and the whole world
14:28
was filled with zombies
14:29
what if you woke up tomorrow and it was
14:31
also groundhog's day
14:32
all over again there are lots of movies
14:34
and films that draw on this idea so you
14:36
could start with something like that
14:38
you could also go with another prompt of
14:40
what if a secret organization
14:42
dot dot dot what if a young girl moves
14:45
to a new town
14:46
and dot dot dot so take some of those
14:48
other types of stories that you have
14:50
loved
14:50
and then put what if at the top of a
14:53
piece of paper and then just start
14:54
letting your imagination go
14:56
and sort of rocket them off like what if
14:58
this what if she did this what if she
15:00
did this and then build on an idea if
15:02
something sparks for you that you say
15:04
what if this shadowy organization had
15:06
control of an entire town
15:08
oh i kind of liked that one then you say
15:10
okay now
15:11
how can i take that a step further okay
15:13
and what if a new girl comes to town and
15:15
finds out that she
15:16
actually is heir to take over that
15:18
organization and they don't want to tell
15:20
her the truth
15:21
okay now that sounds cool what's going
15:23
on with this girl and you kind of
15:25
chain reaction that what if into an
15:28
entire story and see how far it goes see
15:30
how far your imagination goes
15:31
and then what you're left with is a
15:34
really cool story idea then do it again
15:36
what if it's not a shadowy organization
15:38
what if it's
15:39
aliens okay let's take this in a totally
15:42
new direction
15:42
but just remember to have fun with it
15:44
and play that what if game again i do
15:46
have some exercises for you in the
Pick from Real Life
15:48
workbook brainstorming method number
15:49
three is to pull from
15:51
real life and current events so this
15:53
would be going through
15:54
like google your favorite news source
15:56
like celebrity news or any kind of news
15:59
that you have on your phone or your
16:00
computer
16:01
and start looking through the headlines
16:03
and of course taking it and making it
16:04
your own twist
16:05
like local woman finds out that her
16:08
father
16:09
is still alive after you know she
16:11
thought he died in a fire when she was a
16:13
little girl
16:13
oh my gosh that's a whole story right
16:15
there and then take it and just don't
16:17
even read the article if you don't want
16:18
to
16:19
just take those headlines and start
16:20
coming up with what could have kept her
16:22
from her father
16:23
why did they say he died and start
16:26
moving from those
16:27
headlines you can also pull from your
16:29
own life things that have happened to
16:31
you in the past like you're where you
16:32
grew up but let's make it a ghost town
16:35
where like maybe you grew up in a really
16:37
old house that you always felt like was
16:39
haunted so right from that experience
16:41
and start pulling from your own current
16:43
life
16:44
stories that you've heard from friends
16:45
on social media any type of current
16:47
headlines or news
16:49
or you could also pull from lore and
16:51
legends from the past
16:52
like oh there was this ghost ship that
16:54
disappeared in the bermuda triangle
16:56
maybe that's the kernel or spark of a
16:58
story for you so
16:59
real life and current events can be a
17:01
gold mine when it comes to it you just
17:03
have to keep your mind open
17:05
so that you can say okay here's the
17:06
headline how can i make it something
17:09
that is interesting to me and how can i
17:11
twist it but if you're
17:12
feeling a loss for idea take a couple of
17:14
minutes and roam through
17:16
just the headlines of some of your
17:17
favorite like news sources
17:19
and see if something sparks an idea
Immerse & Daydream
17:21
brainstorming method number four is to
17:23
immerse
17:24
and daydream this is of course one of my
17:26
preferred methods and is actually the
17:28
way that i came up with my shadow demon
17:30
saga so i hit this point in my life
17:32
where i knew i didn't want to do
17:33
traditional publishing i wanted to try
17:35
self-publishing and this was back in
17:37
2010 before a lot of people were
17:38
self-publishing
17:39
and i thought okay i want a cool new
17:41
idea something that'll be really fun for
17:43
me something i can just kind of pour my
17:44
heart into and just
17:46
you know let my imagination run wild
17:48
because i don't have to worry about
17:49
getting an agent or anything i can just
17:51
write what i want and that was super
17:52
exciting for me
17:53
but i wasn't sure what the right idea
17:55
was going to be so
17:56
what i did was i took things that i
17:59
could find on netflix
18:01
hbo and other places on tv i went to the
18:04
library i read a bunch of books in genre
18:06
i knew i wanted to write something young
18:07
adult something set in high school
18:09
so on my netflix here comes veronica
18:12
mars and i was like well it's not
18:13
paranormal
18:14
she's not witchy but let's see if i like
18:16
it because it's got a murder mystery in
18:17
it
18:18
and i loved that show i adored it and
18:20
after
18:21
basically immersing myself in that show
18:24
watching every single season back to
18:25
back to back without a break
18:27
this was before i had kids i thought oh
18:30
my gosh
18:30
snarky heroine who's been an outcast
18:32
most of her life or for some part of her
18:34
life
18:35
who's solving mysteries because she's a
18:37
witch and she's using her witchcraft to
18:39
solve mysteries
18:40
that was the spark of the idea for my
18:42
book beautiful demons
18:44
if you've read that series you know it
18:46
doesn't really turn into a witchy
18:47
veronica mars
18:48
at all although there are murder
18:50
mysteries along the way but all it takes
18:52
is that spark of an idea
18:54
so when you immerse yourself and then
18:56
you daydream what i did after i got that
18:58
spark of an idea is i created a vision
19:00
board
19:01
like a mood board for my new character
19:03
harper and what how she lived in what
19:05
was going on with her life oh i'm gonna
19:06
make her an orphan let's do this with
19:08
her let's do this with her
19:09
and that is where the idea began to grow
19:11
but when you're brainstorming all you
19:13
need is that spark
19:14
and for me immersing in that show that
19:16
was high school setting
19:18
same kind of hair when i wanted to write
19:20
was all i needed to get that idea going
19:22
if you have some details of the kind of
19:25
story the feel of the story
19:27
find some type of media it could be
19:29
anime it could be a
19:30
video game it could be a manga it could
19:32
be a series of books
19:34
but find some things that evoke a
19:36
similar feeling or a similar type of
19:37
heroine
19:38
and then immerse yourself whenever i go
19:40
to write one of my zombie books i always
19:42
immerse myself in left 4 dead for a
19:44
couple of days to get myself back in the
19:46
mood of
19:47
every turn there's a new zombie waiting
19:49
for you so that immersing and then
19:51
giving yourself
19:52
the space after you're done like binge
19:54
watching something
19:55
and just saying okay now i can actually
19:59
daydream about what this might be for my
20:02
own series
20:03
also who knew that binge watching
20:05
television show could actually be
20:07
researched for your novel
20:08
it's pretty sweet brainstorming method
The Bounce Method
20:10
number five that i also love to use but
20:12
it is better with a partner is what i
20:14
call the bounce
20:15
method this may have another name but
20:17
this is just what i call it because it's
20:18
all about bouncing ideas off of each
20:20
other so this is basically where you
20:22
choose a
20:23
fun supportive partner who is going to
20:26
be able to rapid fire ideas with you it
20:28
could be a group of people it could be
20:30
people on zoom or it could just be
20:31
yourself you could just write down ideas
20:33
as fast as possible and that would work
20:35
too but i find the energy of the bounce
20:36
method works better if you're actually
20:38
bouncing ideas off
20:39
of a friend or partner but you basically
20:41
just like set a timer
20:43
and you say okay here's the parameters
20:45
we're going to come up with
20:47
ideas for a snarky heroine set in high
20:49
school
20:50
paranormal shadowy organization go and
20:53
you set the timer for 10 minutes
20:54
and you very quickly without thinking
20:56
too much say
20:58
okay she's this she has this kind of
20:59
past no she has this and then you bounce
21:02
back
21:02
ideas from each other what if this so
21:05
it's kind of like the what if method
21:07
but with a partner where you're rapid
21:09
firing as fast as you can
21:11
sometimes getting your brain and that
21:13
judgmental part of yourself out of the
21:15
way
21:16
so that you can rapid fire those ideas
21:18
and getting feedback from somebody else
21:20
can often be a way to really spark ideas
21:22
and to kind of get out of your own way
21:24
when you're brainstorming so there you
21:26
have it five tips for having a
Conclusion
21:27
productive brainstorming session as well
21:30
as my top five methods for getting those
21:33
ideas onto the page
21:34
let me know in the comments your other
21:36
brainstorming methods that you love as
21:38
well as which of these brainstorming
21:40
methods you've either tried in the past
21:42
or that you're going to try and you're
21:43
excited to try
21:45
coming up with great ideas really is
21:47
just about coming up with as
21:49
many ideas as possible and then choosing
21:51
the best one
21:52
so again if i could reiterate anything
21:55
it would be
21:56
no judgment allow yourself to have the
21:58
bad ideas
21:59
because the more ideas you have the
22:01
better they will be
22:02
challenge yourself to go beyond just 10
22:05
or 15 ideas try to get 20 ideas on the
22:07
page and then pick the best one which is
22:09
going to be really fun because in a
22:10
future video i think it's video number
22:12
four in this series
22:13
we're going to talk about how to take
22:15
all those great ideas you just
22:16
brainstormed
22:17
and choose which one is the very best
22:20
one for your situation and
22:22
that's going to make you happy long term
22:23
there is so much more goodness to come
22:26
in this idea series and i hope you're as
22:27
excited for it as i am
22:29

1:00
let me know what you think because i
1:02
would love to do a special video to
1:04
celebrate
1:04
40k but let's get back to business
1:08
so in the month of november we do our
1:11
best to write 50 000 words or
1:13
more an entire novel in 30 days the tips
1:16
that i'm going to give you today
1:17
are of course applicable and maybe i'm
1:19
talking specifically about nanowrimo
1:22
which is national novel writing month
1:24
but really these tips apply anytime you
1:27
finish a rough draft so
1:28
hopefully even if you didn't participate
1:30
in nanowrimo
1:32
these tips will help you get started on
1:34
editing your novel
1:35
whenever you happen to have written it
1:37
the process
1:38
of editing especially if you've never
1:40
done it before
1:41
can be very daunting i completely
1:44
understand
1:45
you have this draft that is
1:48
messy and there's mistakes and the plot
1:51
didn't go where you thought it was going
1:52
to go
1:53
the characters had a mind of their own
1:55
and the idea of
1:56
taking all of that and making it into a
2:00
cohesive
2:01
novel that other people are gonna find
2:02
interesting and in fact want to pay
2:04
money for
2:06
is terrifying to be honest my biggest
2:09
advice to you
2:10
at this stage of the process especially
2:12
if you've never
2:13
edited a novel to completion before
2:16
is to take that pressure and that
2:18
feeling and thought that
2:20
oh my god i have to turn this giant mess
2:22
into a book that other people want to
2:24
read and pay for
2:26
because that is what is going to mess
2:28
with your mind the most is this idea
2:30
that you have to make it a full novel
2:33
stop thinking about the fact that you're
2:34
writing a novel just think about the
2:36
fact that you
2:37
actually have words on the page and you
2:39
have a direction
2:40
and you're just gonna take it one tiny
2:43
step at a time
2:44
to make it better and then you make it
2:46
better again and you make it better
2:48
again
2:48
it's kind of like putting a puzzle
2:50
together you started out with this giant
2:52
jumble of a mess that made no sense and
2:55
slowly but surely you find pieces that
2:57
connect
2:58
but if you worried about like oh i've
3:00
got to make this into an image and it's
3:02
got to be done in this amount of time
3:04
you might start to freak out so instead
3:06
just think about it like you're putting
3:08
this puzzle together you're just going
3:09
to find one piece and connect it to the
3:11
next
3:12
and you're going to just go through the
3:14
process one step at a time
3:16
i'm going to give you my best tips after
3:18
actually writing
3:19
editing and publishing 27 novels to
3:22
great success
3:23
including the novel that i struggled
3:25
with so much during the month of
3:27
november
3:28
that book fate surrender came out and
3:31
hit the top 50 at apple books number one
3:33
in six different categories at amazon
3:35
and
3:36
the top 50 at google play books and has
3:39
had
3:39
mostly if not all five star reviews i
3:41
stopped looking after the first week
3:43
because i don't like to read bad reviews
3:44
so don't tell me in the comments if you
3:46
see any
3:47
i published that book on january 15th
3:49
and i followed
3:50
this system of editing so let me share
3:53
that with you
3:54
but first i do want to say this when it
3:57
comes to writing
3:58
and editing novels everybody is going to
4:01
have their own process
4:02
so if your process looks different or
4:04
you try what i'm telling you and you
4:06
think okay that doesn't work for me
4:08
trust your own intuition there because
4:10
you are going to know
4:12
your own flow your own way of doing
4:14
things better than anyone else could
4:16
tell you
4:16
but in the end you'll never figure out
4:19
your own process if you don't
4:21
just get your hands dirty and get
4:23
started and feel your way through it
4:25
and sometimes that is going to be scary
4:28
or overwhelming
4:29
and it's going to feel like this huge
4:31
job so when it starts to feel big and
4:33
overwhelming
4:34
go back to the basics take it one line
4:36
at a time
4:37
one step at a time and you will make it
4:40
through this
4:41
pay attention as you start these edits
4:44
to what feels good
4:45
what gets you into flow what makes you
4:47
excited to
4:48
keep working and then do more of that
4:51
that being said
4:52
here are my tips for what to do with
4:54
your nanowrimo novel so the first thing
Did you finish the book
4:56
you have to look at
4:57
specifically with nanowrimo since you're
5:00
writing 50 000 words in 30 days
5:02
is did you actually finish the book
5:06
most of the time when you have a
5:08
completed rough draft and you're
5:09
starting your edits you know you
5:11
finished and you got to the end
5:13
but when it comes to nano sometimes
5:14
we're just focused on that 50 000
5:17
number and we didn't actually finish the
5:20
climax and resolution of the novel and
5:22
in fact
5:23
most novels are more like 70 to 100
5:26
000 words depending on your genre so
5:29
it's quite possible
5:30
that you hit that 50 000 words and were
5:33
so exhausted that you just needed to
5:35
take a break for the holidays
5:36
and you never actually finished the book
5:39
so let's talk about
5:40
what happens if you didn't finish the
5:42
story
5:43
in my mind there are two scenarios here
5:46
first scenario is that you didn't finish
5:49
the story but you know what's happening
5:51
next so
5:52
maybe you made it 50 000 words in and
5:54
you've got maybe
5:55
three or four chapters to go but you
5:57
pretty much know
5:59
what's gonna happen in that case just
6:01
get yourself back into the story maybe
6:03
go back and read through the last couple
6:05
chapters or make
6:06
notes or scene cards as to what goes
6:09
next and just
6:10
dive right in and finish that draft
6:12
before you start editing
6:14
i would not recommend going all the way
6:16
back to the story at the beginning and
6:18
editing things and here's why if you
6:21
start editing from the beginning
6:23
you could get lost in this never-ending
6:25
loop of changing things and rewriting
6:28
and changing and never actually
6:29
finishing
6:30
the novel itself and that is a very
6:33
dangerous place to be
6:35
the other thing is that you might end up
6:37
editing and changing things
6:39
that are going to get cut anyway so my
6:42
recommendation for most people
6:43
if you know what happens next you just
6:45
didn't write it
6:47
is to finish the book then go back and
6:49
edit it later
6:51
scenario number two is that you finish
6:54
those 50 000 words
6:56
but that novel went off the rails
6:59
you have no idea what happens next you
7:01
were just struggling to hit that 50
7:03
000 and you're lost this is
7:07
basically where i was when i finished my
7:09
very first nano back in 2007
7:12
because i basically pantsed the whole
7:15
thing i had
7:16
a rough idea of what was going to happen
7:18
and it went
7:19
completely off the rails like i had no
7:21
idea what was going on in that story and
7:23
i was just
7:24
writing random scenes to try to hit the
7:26
50 000 words
7:27
and you know what happened to that novel
7:29
it never got finished it's still sitting
7:31
on my hard drive at 50 000 words with no
7:34
ending to it do not let this happen to
7:36
you
7:36
if this is the case continuing on to
7:40
write a novel that you have no idea what
7:42
it is or what it's about really because
7:44
it went so crazy
7:45
is probably not the best idea so in this
7:48
case what i recommend
7:49
doing is going back to the beginning and
7:52
seeing if you can map out the overall
7:54
structure
7:55
read back through those 50 000 words
7:57
like i'm about to tell you for the edits
8:00
and figure out where the story is going
8:02
you're gonna have a bit of a messier job
8:04
in front of you but the first step is
8:06
definitely going to be reading back
8:08
through
8:08
seeing what's salvageable and where you
8:11
think the rest of the story is going
8:12
once you have that structure down then
8:15
you can finish the book and get that
8:17
rough draft done
8:18
so this next part of the video we're
8:19
going to talk about what do you do once
8:21
the rough draft
8:22
is actually finished if you have not yet
8:25
watched
8:26
my entire video series on how to edit
8:28
your novel
8:29
that is a playlist that i will have
8:31
linked for you down below and i'm going
8:32
to go through some similar steps but
8:34
here today even though i'm going to be
8:36
walking you through a similar process
8:38
i'm going gonna go a little bit into
8:40
more detail in terms of the beginning of
8:43
the editing process
8:44
and again this is just what works for me
Create a scene outline
8:46
so take it or leave it
8:48
and that's fine for me the very first
8:50
thing i do
8:52
is create a scene outline this involves
8:55
going back to the very beginning of the
8:57
book no matter how
8:58
messy it is no matter how terrible i
9:01
think the dialogue is or anything else
9:03
i go back and i start reading from the
9:05
beginning i usually will read it
9:08
on a kindle or i will print it out and i
9:11
will start making
9:12
notes but basically i create a scene
9:14
outline or a chapter outline
9:16
that has the following information the
9:18
name of the pov
9:19
character if i'm writing multiple points
9:22
of view so if you've got a
9:24
hero and a heroine in a romance novel or
9:26
like my
9:27
uh fate surrender novel that i just
9:28
finished you have eight different point
9:30
of view characters
9:31
you want to have like chapter one
9:35
parish so we know whose point of view
9:37
we're in the setting
9:38
so where is parish in this scene where
9:41
does it take place
9:42
the basic conflict or action of the
9:45
scene what is the purpose and how does
9:47
it move the plot forward
9:48
where does this fit into the structure
9:50
of the novel if you know
9:52
or if it has a specific place like is
9:54
this the act one climax or the doorway
9:56
of no return i will make a note about
9:58
that
9:59
and then finally what is the total word
10:01
count
10:02
at the end of this chapter so if it's
10:04
scene number one
10:05
at the end and it ends at 2100 words i
10:09
would write 2
10:10
100 words when i get to let's say
10:12
chapter 5
10:13
and i hit the end of it i will mark what
10:16
where am i
10:17
in terms of word count so that might be
10:19
by the end of chapter 5 it might be 10
10:22
565 words into the novel
10:24
i do this specifically because i like to
10:28
see
10:28
the pacing of the book so we can talk
10:31
more about pacing
10:32
i do have a couple of videos here on
10:33
this channel about pacing
10:35
but basically you want that act one
10:38
climax to come somewhere around 20 to 25
10:41
through your novel so if you have a
10:42
hundred thousand word novel
10:44
and your act one climax is happening at
10:46
ten thousand words
10:48
you've got a problem or alternately if
10:50
you've got a hundred thousand word novel
10:52
and your act one climax is not happening
10:54
until thirty five thousand words into
10:56
the book
10:57
you've got a pacing problem so it's
10:59
important when you're making that scene
11:00
outline
11:01
to mark where you are in the word count
Dont edit anything
11:04
during this
11:05
read-through where i'm creating the
11:06
scene outline i am not
11:08
editing anything i'm not changing words
11:10
i'm not adding dialogue
11:12
i'm just making notes and observations
11:15
i'm
11:15
writing down the data of what happens in
11:17
the scene so that i get an idea of what
11:20
happened in the book
11:21
sometimes during nano the whole thing
11:23
can become a blur
11:24
so you re-familiarizing yourself with
11:28
that book but you're not changing
Structure
11:29
anything no matter how much you may want
11:31
to
11:32
step two once you've got that scene
11:34
outline
11:35
is to take an overview
11:38
of the structure of your book even if
11:40
you pantsed your way through nano
11:43
meaning you didn't have an outline you
11:44
just wrote uh intuitively
11:46
next scene next scene now is the time
11:49
that you really need to take a look at
11:51
the structure of your novel
11:52
so where is the act one climax what is
11:55
happening at the midpoint of the novel
11:57
what is happening in the black moment
11:59
and are all those pieces
12:01
there if you have no idea what i'm
12:03
talking about with those different types
12:05
of scene structures
12:06
it's possible that you use a different
12:08
type of plotting method so just take
12:10
whatever your personal roadmap is for
12:13
structure
12:14
and try to map your novel to it does it
12:16
fit
12:17
what's missing what's really well done
12:20
and what needs to be added to the novel
12:23
or changed or shifted around
12:25
this part of the process is one of the
12:27
longer pieces for me because
12:29
i have to really go through and see if
12:31
this is the strongest
12:33
development of the story as possible if
12:36
you want to go a little deeper with this
12:38
i do also have a series of videos here
12:41
on youtube about how to plot your novel
12:43
and that will walk you through the type
12:44
of structure that i follow which is the
12:46
basic three act structure
12:48
but if you follow something else like
12:50
save the cat or different types of
12:52
plotting your novel
12:53
ideas then just follow that structure
12:55
and make sure all the pieces are in
Scenes
12:57
place
12:57
number three is all about identifying
13:00
which scenes you're going to keep
13:02
which scenes you're going to toss so
13:04
even though you're three steps into
13:06
this process and potentially weeks into
13:08
it you still haven't actually touched
13:10
any of the words yet so this is where
13:12
you're gonna take that bird's eye view
13:13
and you're gonna say
13:14
okay what's staying what's gonna go you
13:17
might be like well this whole scene
13:19
where they go to the college or they do
13:21
this competition that really doesn't fit
13:22
into the novel
13:23
so i'm gonna cut it and then you make
13:25
another note about you know what i
13:27
actually feel
13:28
like there needs to be a scene in
13:30
between this one and this one where they
13:31
have a conversation
13:33
so that's a change that needs to happen
13:35
so you're identifying what scenes are
13:37
cut
13:38
what scenes need to be added to it and
13:40
what things need to be strengthened
13:42
so in this stage of the process i will
13:44
often make note about
13:46
breadcrumbs or threads that are woven
13:48
throughout the story like
13:50
oh there's this one thing happening with
13:52
zoe in the book
13:53
have i really woven that thread
13:56
through the book strongly enough or do i
13:58
need to add a few more scenes where we
14:00
see
14:01
zoe doing this certain thing so you're
14:03
identifying story threads you're
14:05
identifying
14:06
if you're writing mystery or romance
14:08
you're identifying those pieces of the
14:09
character arc that need to be
14:11
strengthened and changed
14:12
but the main thing is you're identifying
14:14
what scenes stay and what scenes need to
14:16
go
14:17
what scenes need to be written step four
Missing Scenes
14:20
for me
14:21
is to go through and fill in the scenes
14:23
that we're missing
14:24
so at this point i will have notes or a
14:27
note card that says in between chapters
14:29
seven and
14:30
eight i need to add a scene where zoe's
14:31
talking to the boy
14:33
and i will know story structure wise why
14:35
this is important so this is a scene
14:37
that sets up this conflict or it's a
14:39
scene that strengthens my character arc
14:41
and it was missing from the draft so
14:44
instead of starting at the beginning for
14:45
myself
14:46
and starting line edits where you go
14:48
through and you're fixing dialogue and
14:50
word choice
14:51
i like to fill in those missing scenes
14:53
for me in particular
14:55
battle scenes or sex scenes which i
14:58
don't write a lot of sex scenes in my
15:00
books they're never in my young adult
15:01
novels but i do have a few new adult
15:03
novels that do have them
15:04
and they're always hard for me to write
15:06
i don't necessarily enjoy
15:07
writing them battle scenes also
15:10
especially because i write magic
15:12
it can be really tough logistically like
15:15
how is she gonna throw this
15:16
fireball how do i explain that so when
15:19
i'm fast
15:19
drafting i will sometimes just put in
15:22
placeholders and i'll say
15:24
battle scene with harper here and i
15:26
won't actually write the scene because i
15:28
know that it needs
15:29
more space and time for me to really sit
15:32
down and craft that scene
15:34
so when i'm fast drafting i just skip it
15:37
so this step four in my process
15:39
is to go back and identify those scenes
15:41
that i skipped
15:42
usually battle scenes or tough emotional
15:45
scenes
15:46
and fill them in so that means
15:49
writing a little bit out of order if you
15:51
can't do this then feel free to go back
15:53
to the beginning and
15:54
and as you're editing rewrite those
15:56
scenes it's really up to you as to what
15:58
feels better for you i can just go and
16:01
slip those scenes in
16:03
but some people i know need to just
16:04
start back at the beginning and add it
16:06
in
16:06
when you get to it so either order you
16:08
go in is totally fine
16:10
you just need to get the whole book
Developmental Changes
16:11
finished so if you have missing scenes
16:14
now's the time to put them back in
16:16
number five
16:17
is making those developmental changes so
16:20
we're talking still
16:21
even though we're five steps in about
16:23
the bigger
16:24
story structure so this is where you're
16:27
really getting that structure in place
16:28
you're
16:29
fixing the developmental things the
16:30
conversations that needed to happen
16:33
strengthening the character arc having
16:35
that climax
16:36
be climaxy and really like a big set
16:39
piece
16:40
and making sure that the ending has that
16:42
emotional beat that you want it to have
16:44
so you're kind of fixing and changing
16:46
those big developmental things
16:48
that need to change in the story so this
16:50
is where you actually cut
16:51
things and you make those scenes fit
16:54
together better
16:55
until finally at the end of step five
16:58
you have
16:58
your entire draft the way that you
17:00
really want it to be this is as close to
17:03
a final draft as you've been
17:04
so far because you've cut the things
17:07
that need to be cut you've filled in the
17:08
missing scenes you've bridged the gap
17:10
between
17:11
you know scene and sequel and reaction
17:14
and that sort of thing and you've got
17:15
basically an
17:16
entire novel once you get to that point
Line By Line
17:19
and everything
17:20
there at those first five steps is done
17:22
now it's time to go
17:24
piece by piece line by line through your
17:26
novel so this is usually called
17:28
line edits and you're still just self
17:30
editing at this point
17:32
maybe as part of your process you've
17:34
sent it out to a critique partner or
17:36
group that you belong to which is fine
17:38
too
17:38
but for me at least in this part of the
17:40
process no one has read this book yet
17:43
this has still just been all me but at
17:45
this point of the process what i like to
17:47
do is something that i was talking about
17:49
in my previous video about how i
17:51
finish up my edits if you want to check
17:54
out the end of the nanowrimo diaries for
17:56
me and talking about how i
17:58
edited the final edits for fate
18:00
surrender that is in my previous video
18:02
here on this channel
18:03
basically what i do is i open up a new
18:05
google doc totally fresh google doc
18:07
and i will just copy one chapter over to
18:10
the fresh
18:11
like from the draft to the fresh dock at
18:13
a time just one chapter at a time so
18:15
that i don't feel overwhelmed and it
18:17
doesn't feel like this huge
18:18
job i just have this one chapter and
18:21
this is the point where i will go line
18:23
by line and choose better words stronger
18:26
emotions add in better dialogue
18:29
and at this point i'm not really
18:30
changing the story i'm just
18:32
strengthening what's already there
18:34
but for me this is getting toward the
18:37
end of the process
18:38
if you want to hear the nitty gritty of
18:40
where i go from there definitely check
18:42
out my video on how to edit your own
18:43
novel that i'll have linked down below
18:46
that's it you guys that's all you do
18:48
just get started right there with step
18:50
one and create that scene outline once
18:52
your
18:52
rough draft is really done create that
18:55
scene outline and go step by step
18:57
i promise that it will feel so much
18:59
better
19:00
once you've seen and really gotten a
19:02
feeling for what's
19:03
there what's usable what needs to be
19:06
rewritten
19:07
it feels like very tedious work and
19:09
sometimes it can be emotionally
19:11
difficult to sort of
19:12
face the truth of what shape this novel
19:15
is in
19:16
but a lot of times we think it's worse
19:18
than it is
19:19
so when you get to that stage and you're
19:22
reading through
19:22
chances are you're gonna find yeah there
19:25
are some scenes that are really crap
19:26
here like what were you thinking was
19:28
this something you wrote at 2am
19:30
when you were half delirious maybe but
19:32
you're also gonna find
19:33
hidden gems that you forgot you wrote
19:36
because you were running so fast
19:38
and you're gonna be like holy moly this
19:40
scene is really good did i
19:42
write that am i secretly a genius and
19:44
yes you
19:45
are there are going to be moments of
19:47
brilliance in your
19:48
rough draft so cherish that pat yourself
19:51
on the back
19:52
and for anything that you run across
19:54
that is just not good enough
19:56
just know that you can now fix it this
19:59
is your opportunity to make it the very
20:01
best it can be
20:02
so take it one tiny step at a time
20:04
you've totally got this
20:06
and i cannot wait to hear about how your
20:08
edits went and when you finally get this
20:10

0:28
that's settled
0:29
so anyway welcome back to my channel
0:32
today and we're going to be talking
0:33
about how to be a successful in the
0:36
author if you're new to my channel and
0:42
you wonder how I have the authority to
0:44
be talking about such things my name is
0:46
Sarah cannon I am the author of more
0:48
than 25 novels most of which are young
0:51
adult paranormal but I also write some
0:53
college-age almost always coming-of-age
0:55
stories sometimes contemporary sometimes
0:58
paranormal I started self-publishing in
1:01
late 2010 so I was a little bit early on
1:05
in the self-publishing ebook industry
1:08
and I've been around for a little while
1:10
now and over the course of the last
1:12
eight and a half to nine years I have
1:14
sold almost 750,000 copies of my books
1:18
and my books have been downloaded well
1:20
over a million times so I'm gonna talk
1:22
to you about what I think it takes to be
1:24
a successful indie author in today's
1:27
market and hopefully for years and years
1:29
to come so my first tip is to define the
Defining success
1:32
word success for yourself because I
1:35
think that immediately when people say
1:37
how to be a successful indie author
1:39
there's this version of success that
1:42
comes up that's like in order to be
1:43
successful you have to be making loads
1:46
and loads of money you have to hit the
1:47
New York Times or the USA Today
1:49
bestseller list you have to be in the
1:50
top 100 on Amazon and you have to have
1:53
all these accolades or you have to have
1:54
all these people who know who you are or
1:56
have 40,000 people on your mailing list
1:58
or whatever but the truth is I really
2:00
don't think that deep in our heart of
2:02
hearts
2:03
most of us define success by those
2:05
numbers and I think in fact that it can
2:07
be quite dangerous to define your own
2:10
personal success by number
2:13
or awards that you might win because
2:15
those things aren't fully in your
2:17
control but the first step to truly
2:19
being a successful indie author is to
2:21
really define what success means to you
2:23
what does it look like to you what is
2:26
your ideal life as an author really look
2:28
like and once you can see that in your
2:30
head you can picture it you've journaled
2:32
it and you know what that looks like
2:34
because it doesn't necessarily mean that
2:36
in order to be a success you have to
2:38
meet somebody else's outside validation
2:41
of what it means to be a successful
2:43
author you don't have to have sold a
2:45
million ebooks you don't have to have
2:46
hit the USA Today bestseller list for
2:48
you success might just mean having your
2:51
first book actually published and have
2:53
sold more than 50 copies of it because
2:55
you know there aren't 50 people who in
2:57
your friends list who would have bought
2:59
your book that's one of the first things
3:01
that was for me is you know I had that
3:03
first month and I sold maybe 47 I think
3:05
or 49 copies my very first month and
3:08
then the second month of publishing I
3:10
realized oh my gosh now I've sold a
3:13
hundred or 200 and there's no way I know
3:15
that many people who would be nice
3:16
enough to just as friends pick up my
3:18
book so there's got to be actual readers
3:21
out there reading it and for me at that
3:22
time in 2010 that was a huge huge level
3:26
of success even though nobody else would
3:29
have called that a huge success for me
3:31
it really meant the world and success
3:33
doesn't necessarily mean to me having a
3:36
million dollar income which I don't have
3:38
it means being able to support my family
3:41
and being able to stay home with my
3:43
children being able to be able to bring
3:46
this sweet new baby girl into the world
3:48
in just over a month and a half and be
3:52
able to have the life that I want to
3:54
live and set my own hours and write and
3:56
do things that I love and connect with
3:58
my fans all of those things mean so much
4:00
more to me than making a million dollars
4:03
a year or hitting the USA Today
4:05
bestseller list which I've never done
4:07
despite the number of books that I've
4:09
sold so for you success means something
4:12
maybe completely different than what it
4:14
means to me or what it means to the next
4:16
person watching this video but in order
4:18
to truly be a success as an indie author
4:20
you need to define that word for
4:23
yourself and figure out what that looks
4:24
like for you because
4:26
until you understand what success looks
4:28
like and means to you on a personal
4:30
level you're either going to fall into
4:32
traps where you're constantly comparing
4:34
yourself to other people which believe
4:36
me never leads to happiness and joy or
4:39
you're going to fall into following
4:42
somebody else's idea of success or
4:44
someone else's plan for what success
4:46
looks like and that also can be a trap
4:48
in terms of following somebody else's
4:50
idea of happiness or success because
4:53
that might not be what you truly want
4:55
out of your life so step number one is
4:58
to define success for yourself
5:00
step number two is to learn to be the
5:02
very best writer that you can be and
5:04
what I mean by this is it doesn't mean
5:08
you have to be a perfect writer even
5:10
Stephen King after how many novels does
5:12
he have a hundred books that he's
5:13
written I don't know 50 books plus who
5:16
knows somebody comment below and let me
5:19
know how many novels Stephen King has
5:21
out but I'm sure he's sold tens of
5:24
millions of copies of his books and he
5:26
makes millions of dollars a year and has
5:29
fans all over the world who are loyal to
5:30
him and even Stephen King says that he
5:33
feels like he's a newbie writer because
5:35
he has so much to learn even after all
5:37
these years of writing and practicing
5:39
his craft so I'm not saying that you
5:42
have to be a perfect author before you
5:43
put yourself out there and in fact if
5:45
you wait for yourself to be perfect
5:47
you're never going to be any kind of
5:49
published author because you'll be too
5:50
scared to put yourself out there so
5:52
don't wait until you're perfect but
5:53
always continue to focus on craft
5:56
because the more you can learn even
5:58
after years and years of publishing or
6:00
20 books on your back list continuing to
6:03
focus on craft and become the best
6:05
writer you can be is always going to
6:07
lead you down a path of success now
6:09
nothing of course guarantees just
6:11
because you write a great book that a
6:12
lot of people are going to buy it but
6:14
the better writer you are the more
6:16
long-term success you're going to find
6:18
and the more satisfaction you're going
6:20
to find in this business so focus on
6:22
craft and become the best writer that
6:24
you can possibly be
Create a strategy
6:25
so step number three is to create a
6:29
strategy for your publishing life I'm
6:32
not specifically talking about
6:34
traditionally published authors I'm
6:35
specifically talking about indie authors
6:37
where you publish your own book
6:39
then every decision that you make is
6:40
yours so step number three is to create
6:44
a strategy that focuses on two main
6:47
goals number one to always be bringing
6:50
in new readers and number two to be
6:52
turning those readers into loyal fans if
6:55
you can accomplish those two things then
6:57
you are well on your way towards
6:59
long-term success as an indie author and
7:01
a great income for yourself because if
7:03
you can constantly be bringing new
7:04
people in and constantly feeding more
7:08
sales to the early books in your series
7:10
and then turning those readers into
7:12
loyal fans because you really gave them
7:14
what they wanted and you gave them a
7:16
great crafted story and you treated them
7:18
with respect and had all these other
7:20
things in place that helped to turn
7:22
those readers into loyal fans then you
7:24
are going to be well on your way toward
7:26
an amazing career that lasts for years
7:29
to come
7:29
now I don't have time in this one video
7:32
to go into the strategies that I would
7:34
use to do this but just know that if you
7:38
always are focusing on what's gonna
7:40
bring in new readers and what is going
7:42
to keep and hold on to those readers and
7:44
you ask yourself does this bring in new
7:47
readers and does this turn them into
7:49
loyal fans every time you make a
7:51
decision you're going to be on the right
7:53
path people who go into indie publishing
7:56
without any kind of strategy they just
7:58
decide oh I really want to write this
8:00
and then ooh I kind of want to write
8:01
this and Wow maybe I should write this
8:03
or I should do this and they're
8:04
constantly changing their tactics and
8:06
watching what other people are doing and
8:08
kind of throwing spaghetti at the wall
8:10
are the people who tend to struggle the
8:12
most so creating a solid strategy with
8:14
those two goals in mind will definitely
8:16
put you on the right path and then once
8:18
you have a strategy really following
8:20
through with it which leads me into
Understand and learn
8:22
number four which is to take the time to
8:25
understand and learn both reader
8:26
expectations and the importance of genre
8:30
so one mistake that I see a lot of
8:32
people make when they're learning to be
8:34
an indie author or they're hoping to be
8:35
an indie author is that they don't write
8:37
in a clear and establish a genre they
8:39
just write whatever they feel like
8:41
writing which ends up not really
8:42
following any type of genre or reader
8:45
expectation it just ends up being like a
8:48
thriller that has this big romance in
8:50
that turns into a mystery at the end and
8:52
then at the very end they go through a
8:54
portal and there's aliens you know and
8:57
it's kind of a hodgepodge of many
8:59
different genres and a lot of us of
9:01
course get excited and are very
9:02
interested in trying new things and
9:04
trying lots of different genres but if
9:07
you want to be a successful indie author
9:08
you need to have a solid understanding
9:10
of what genre is what book categories
9:13
are and what reader expectations are
9:15
within those categories because the more
9:18
you understand that and the more you can
9:19
deliver books that fit well into like a
9:22
place in the Kindle Store or
9:24
specifically into a shelf on Barnes &
9:27
Noble's store that you readers would
9:29
know exactly where to go to find it and
9:30
then once they get it like if they were
9:32
looking for that urban fantasy with a
9:34
kick-ass female character heroine with a
9:37
strong romantic element that's exactly
9:39
what your book delivers rather than
9:40
they're looking for an urban fantasy but
9:42
you're kind of giving them a paranormal
9:44
romance with shifters that has a really
9:46
strong mystery and then a sci-fi element
9:48
at the end those kind of genre mashups
9:51
where you're not sticking to one genre
9:53
and you're really pulling from lots of
9:56
different things and you're not
9:56
following the rules of fiction so to
9:59
speak are going to have a harder time it
10:01
doesn't mean you can't do it because
10:03
there's always examples of people who
10:04
just did their own thing and found
10:06
success but it just means it might take
10:08
you longer or it might be more difficult
10:10
than if you followed the rules or reader
10:12
expectations above well-established
10:15
genres now that doesn't mean you have to
10:17
copy anyone else and it doesn't mean
10:19
that you always have to follow the rules
10:20
but it needs that it means that you need
10:22
to understand kind of what the
10:24
expectations and rules are of the each
10:26
genre and the less you deviate from that
10:28
you can write your own story with your
10:30
own kind of characters and make it
10:32
really Sparkle but it needs to fit into
10:34
a well established genre if you want to
10:37
find success faster
10:38
number five is also related to this in
Find a happy balance
10:41
that what I would recommend is to find
10:44
that happy balance between your art and
10:46
your business some people will flat-out
10:49
tell you that in order to be a
10:50
successful indie author you have to stop
10:52
thinking about writing what you love and
10:54
write entirely to market which means
10:56
that you have to write exactly does onre
10:58
you have to write exactly to the rules
10:59
and follow everybody else's path like
11:02
where the trends that's
11:03
you need to write but I don't really
11:04
subscribe to this and I've built a
11:06
multiple six-figure career where I don't
11:08
do this myself so it is possible to have
11:11
great success without sacrificing
11:14
writing what you love but I do think
11:17
that in order to be successful in this
11:19
business you have to consider the market
11:21
because you're not just writing a book
11:23
for yourself you're writing it if you
11:24
want to be an indie author and you want
11:26
to be making money at this you're
11:27
writing it hoping that other people are
11:29
going to buy it so to just not think
11:31
about those other people and not think
11:33
about the marketing or the business of
11:35
this before you start publishing is a
11:38
mistake because you're not going to make
11:40
any money if you just say I don't care
11:42
about the readers I just want to write
11:43
what I write want to write but then
11:45
again we go back to defining success for
11:48
yourself because maybe money isn't
11:49
important to you and maybe you just care
11:51
about writing what you want to write and
11:53
in that case you can just disregard this
11:55
rule but what I say is you want to find
11:58
basically the most marketable books that
12:03
you will love to write I don't think
12:06
that it's a great long-term strategy to
12:08
write books that you don't enjoy reading
12:10
or that you don't enjoy writing so for
12:13
example I've mentioned this on my
12:15
channel before I actually enjoy reading
12:17
romance contemporary romance but in the
12:20
early days of my career I really wanted
12:23
to write paranormal stories about
12:25
college age or coming-of-age characters
12:27
and I met up with a group of writers who
12:30
told me oh no you want to make money you
12:32
should be writing contemporary romance
12:33
for Harlequin and I got so scared and
12:36
panicked that I wouldn't be able to
12:37
write what I wanted so I spent an entire
12:39
year of my life writing a book that was
12:42
something I didn't enjoy I would have
12:45
enjoyed it as a reader but as a writer I
12:47
did not enjoy this kind of like
12:48
millionaire trophy romance that was for
12:52
Harlequin and I did it anyway because I
12:54
felt like it was the only way I could
12:55
make money and I sort of compromised
12:57
myself in that way but I learned a huge
12:59
lesson that I did not want to spend the
13:02
rest of my life writing something I
13:04
didn't enjoy just so I could be a paid
13:06
writer if I was going to do this I
13:08
wanted to be happy doing it so I
13:12
actually only pitched to one agent in my
13:14
life she turned me down also and I pick
13:16
to one editor in my life but after just
13:18
those two experiences I just decided you
13:21
know what what I want to do is I want to
13:22
take my career into my own hands and I
13:24
want to write what I want to write but I
13:26
also kept my reader in mind and I
13:29
thought what types of books do I want to
13:31
write that readers really want to read
13:34
and that readers enjoy reading so I
13:35
didn't pick like the trendiest thing I
13:38
didn't pick you know something that
13:40
someone told me would make a lot of
13:41
money I chose something that I knew I
13:44
would love that I had lots of ideas
13:45
coming forward for me which was young
13:48
adult paranormal witches and demons
13:50
things that I just loved to write about
13:52
and I presented it in a way that I knew
13:55
other readers enjoyed reading so it fit
13:58
very well into this sort of young adult
14:00
paranormal category or genre which now
14:04
it's kind of turned into more young
14:05
adult fantasy or young adult
14:07
contemporary fantasy more so than just
14:08
paranormal but at the time that's where
14:10
it fit in and it really felt good to me
14:13
because I enjoyed writing it so if you
14:15
can find that happy balance where you
14:17
can find the most marketable books that
14:19
you will love to write so that you can
14:21
enjoy what you're writing but also have
14:23
an audience that wants to read them you
14:26
are going to be miles ahead in your
14:29
indie publishing career the final tip
Support your mental and physical health
14:30
that I have for you is to make choices
14:32
that support both your mental and your
14:35
physical health and I feel like this is
14:37
something that often gets overlooked
14:38
when we talk about success as an indie
14:40
author you can hear tons of other people
14:42
talking about well here's how you get a
14:45
bunch of ads on your books here's how
14:46
you spend money here's how you do your
14:48
newsletter list here's how you wrap it
14:50
release and publish as many books as you
14:51
can or here's how you follow trends and
14:53
all that stuff can be great advice but
14:56
if you want to be successful long-term
14:57
you have to take both your mental health
15:00
and your physical health into
15:02
consideration I cannot even tell you how
15:04
many authors I've seen over the last
15:06
nine years who have tried to follow some
15:08
of that advice about writing a book a
15:10
month and putting a ton of money into
15:12
self-publishing and doing things that
15:14
you frankly don't love to do just to
15:16
make more money or just to step up and
15:18
become a little bit more famous in this
15:20
and instead of following their own
15:21
success and paying attention to their
15:23
mental or physical health they burned
15:25
themselves out they some of them got
15:29
addicted to drugs I have a
15:30
friend that ended up in the hospital
15:32
through major fatigue and burnout she
15:34
almost had a heart attack and was down
15:37
for the count for more than six months
15:38
as her body recovered
15:39
I know authors who have really abused
15:42
their bodies in terms of the things they
15:45
eat and not getting up and moving around
15:47
because they're trying to write so many
15:49
hours a day and get those books out so
15:51
quickly the after a year they've gained
15:53
a hundred pounds and they've got all
15:54
these aches and pains and they've
15:56
ignored their families and they've even
15:58
gotten divorces and things like this
16:00
this is serious stuff you guys and I'm
16:02
not saying that in a gossipy way I'm
16:04
saying it because it breaks my heart
16:05
every time I see a talented author quit
16:07
because they weren't paying attention to
16:09
their mental or physical health I know
Having a family
16:12
that for me personally having a baby is
16:14
super important to me having a family is
16:16
super important to me so I am not the
16:19
type of author who likes to spend 12
16:21
plus hours a day writing and I'm not the
16:24
type of author who can put out 12 or 13
16:26
books a year the max I've ever done in a
16:29
year is five and that was huge for me
16:32
and I might never be able to do that
16:34
again most of my career I've put out two
16:36
to three books a year which I feel like
16:37
is quite fast and it's taken pretty much
16:40
everything that I can to put out books
16:43
that quickly which to me feels quickly
16:45
because I have limits to what I can do I
16:49
pay attention to my own mental and
16:52
physical health along the way so there
16:54
have been times when I have really
16:55
pushed myself to the limit either on
16:57
writing retreats or at home you know
17:00
pulling all-nighters
17:01
to finish a book but I also know that
17:03
once I finished that sort of binge
17:05
writing or I finished something just the
17:08
last minute or really pushed my body to
17:11
be able to finish a book then I have to
17:13
take a break and I can't immediately
17:14
start another book I need to take a
17:16
break and then pay attention to the
17:18
marketing and pay attention to myself go
17:20
to the beach go on vacation spend more
17:22
time with my family for a while and yes
17:24
that might mean sacrificing a hundred
17:27
thousand dollars a year or more by not
17:29
getting more books out but I also know
17:31
that if I allowed myself to completely
17:34
burn out or become ill or even to just
17:36
stop loving the act of writing that I
17:39
wouldn't be able to put out any books a
17:41
year and I wouldn't be making the money
17:42
that I
17:42
making now and I wouldn't be connecting
17:44
with the fans that I'm connecting with
17:45
now and even this year in 2019 so I told
17:49
you in 2018 I actually published five
17:52
books well so far in 2019
17:54
I have not published or finished a
17:56
single book because I have been dealing
17:59
with morning sickness and extra fatigue
18:02
and nausea and just the emotional and
18:05
hormonal changes that go along with
18:07
being pregnant and that's a sacrifice
18:09
that I'm willing to make because for me
18:11
success is having this family and I've
18:13
been wanting this baby for so long that
18:15
this is extremely important to me and I
18:18
keep in contact with my fans and I have
18:20
built these loyal fans and this career
18:22
where they will wait for me and they
18:25
will be patient for the most part and
18:27
wait for that book and when the book
18:28
comes out it will be the best of my
18:31
ability to do but I am not willing to
18:33
sacrifice my mental or physical health
18:35
or my time with my family in order to
18:37
make more money and that's just a part
18:39
of what success means to me success
18:41
might mean something totally different
18:43
to you and maybe you want to write 12
18:46
books a year or you maybe want to write
18:47
20 hours a day I don't know but if you
18:50
define success for yourself and figure
18:53
out what it really looks like and what
18:54
it feels like to you you learn to be the
18:57
very best writer you can and continue to
18:59
focus on craft and continue to improve
19:01
as you publish then create and come up
19:04
with a solid strategy for yourself like
19:06
a long-term strategy be thinking several
19:09
years ahead where you're focusing on
19:11
bringing in new readers and turning
19:13
those readers into loyal fans and then
19:15
you continue to learn and research the
19:18
genre expectations that readers have and
19:20
where your book fits into those genres
19:23
and then number five find that happy
19:25
medium for yourself where you're writing
19:27
marketable books that readers want to
19:29
read but that you love to write and then
19:33
finally paying attention to your
19:35
physical and your mental health along
19:36
the way so that you can truly be
19:38
successful long-term and stay at this
19:40
for a very long time then I promise you
19:42
you are on your way to becoming a
19:45
successful indie author one thing I want
19:47
you to know is that there really is no
19:49
one path to success and there are people
19:52
out there that will preach this is the
19:54
way and this is the only way
19:55
and I understand that a lot of people do
19:58
believe that especially in this market
19:59
now with Kindle unlimited versus trying
20:02
to publish wide there are a lot of
20:04
people that have opinions but I'm here
20:05
to tell you that there really is room
20:07
for all of us to have our own version of
20:10
success it is not easy to be an indie
20:12
author but it can be an extremely
20:14
rewarding experience and if you want to
20:17
do it I highly recommend that you follow
20:19
these tips that I've set out for you
20:20
today and really and truly above all
20:23
define success for yourself and really
20:25
think about what you want on an
20:26
individual and personal level because
20:29
there is no one way but I think there is
20:31
room for all of us and if this is what
20:33
you have wanted for your whole life is
20:35
to be an author and to get your books
20:37
out there then I am absolutely going to
20:39
encourage you to do it and I know and
20:41
believe that you can do it I wish that I
Publish Thrive Course
20:44
could go even deeper into the strategy
20:46
and the genre and the cover art and all
20:48
of those things on this channel and I
20:50
will probably be putting out more videos
20:52
that go deeper into what makes a
20:54
successful in the author career but
20:57
there is so much information that I
21:00
would need to share with you that it
21:02
would probably take me years to go
21:03
through it all here on my youtube
21:05
channel but what I have done is I have
21:07
put together a course that has taken me
21:08
months of time and effort and energy
21:11
that is called publish and thrive and
21:13
that course launches tomorrow
21:15
it's a five-week course about how to
21:17
publish your books but also thrive long
21:19
term so it addresses not only the
21:22
strategy sections and marketing but it
21:24
also addresses mindset and how to define
21:27
success for yourself so that you can
21:29
have a long-term successful career where
21:31
you're truly flourishing and thriving as
21:33
an indie author so all of my students
21:36
for this round will be founding members
21:38
of my publish and thrive course and it
21:40
opens tomorrow which means registration
21:42
also closes in about 24 hours from when
21:45
this video goes live there will be a
21:47
link down below for you to follow if you
21:49
would like to join us in that course I
21:51
would love to have you I'm not sure when
21:53
I'll be able to open this course up
21:54
again because like I said I have this
21:56
baby girl coming in August and I'm just
21:59
not sure if I'll be able to open and run
22:00
this course again in 2019 but it will
22:02
definitely come back at least in 2020 so
22:05
if you're watching this video
22:07
after the course has closed which is
22:09
after July 8th 2019 then there will be a
22:13
waiting list posted down below where you
22:15
can sign up for newsletter announcements
22:17
whenever this course goes live again I
22:19
would certainly love to have you and
22:20
it's a five week course that goes
22:22
through pretty much everything I have
22:23
learned over the course of nine plus
22:26
years as an indie author so come join us
22:29
one of the reasons that I felt so
22:31
compelled to start this course is that I
22:33
do feel that right now there's a lot of
22:35
information saying that there is this
22:37
only this one path to success and that
22:39
one path that a lot of people preach has
22:41
nothing to do with joy or defining
22:43
success on your own terms and it's a lot
22:46
about how to spend a lot of money on ads
22:48
how to go into Kindle and limited and
22:51
right to trends and write as fast as you
22:53
can
22:53
but I want to present to people that
22:56
there is another way where you can truly
22:58
flourish and truly thrive without having
23:00
to sacrifice time with your family or
23:02
sacrifice writing books that you love
23:04
and so that's what I'm presenting in
23:06
this course it is not a Facebook Ads
23:08
course it is not I don't even go into
23:09
AMS ads or that type of marketing but
23:12
what I do is give the fundamental so
23:14
that you need to craft a strategy that
23:16
will help you be successful long term so
23:18
I won't say anything more about the
23:19
publish and thrive course but if you're
23:21
interested and these tips really
23:22
resonated with you and you are either
23:24
looking to self polish sometime soon in
23:26
the future or you have already started
23:29
self-publishing but just haven't found
23:30
the success that you were hoping for I
23:32
would love for you to look into the
23:33
course and go follow that link down
23:35
below and it will tell you a little bit
23:37
more about what each module covers and
23:39
what we'll be doing over the course of
23:41
the next five weeks alright guys thank
23:43
you so much for joining me today I hope
23:45
these tips helped and resonated with you
23:47
I hope that you like the looks of my new
23:49
office and you'll be seeing it maybe
23:51
from different angles more and more
23:53
coming up and I will see you all in my
23:55
next video bye
23:59
[Music]
hey everybody welcome back to heart breathings today i have a special treat for you because i'm going to be taking
0:06
you behind the scenes of some of my sales numbers for the past 11 to 12
0:11
years of self-publishing and i'm gonna give you actual statistics and details about what are my best-selling books
0:18
what are my best-selling series and why i think the books that are at the top in terms of number of books sold and number
0:25
of dollars earned which are two separate things really and we'll talk about why why i think those books are at the top
0:32
and how i would use that information if i was a new author looking to really increase my sales or make the most
0:38
amount of money or get my books into the hands of as many readers as possible so if you love data and you want to see
0:45
kind of what's one author's experience after more than a decade of publishing then this is going to be a really fun
0:51
video for you
0:57
if you clicked on this video and you are new to me my name is sarah cannon i am the indie author of more than 27 novels
1:05
and short stories and i have today sold over 750 000 books in my career and i'm
1:13
going to talk about some of the ups and downs there which of the books that i have that have sold the most which ones
1:19
have not sold as well and why and we're going to kind of tie that all into strategy traditionally book sales are
1:27
something that authors never really used to share in traditional publishing because it can really vary in terms of
1:33
the contracts whether you're even allowed to share how much money you got for an advance or sometimes authors
1:39
don't know for a long time how many books they sold but when it comes to indie publishing
1:44
the veil has been lifted so to speak and we get access to our sales numbers pretty much on a minute by minute basis
1:51
and i have been tracking my sales through various platforms i used to track them on my own every single day i just go in
1:58
at midnight and track my sales but there are tools now that will automatically pull your sales numbers from your
2:04
vendors which is really nice as well so i'm going to be sharing my favorite one with you today but most importantly i wanted to share some of the wisdom that
2:11
i've gained from why are these books the ones that have sold the most what would i do differently if i were starting my
2:17
career over and what would i do if i was an author looking to really increase my sales and my reach from here out so
2:25
i'm excited to get started also just to mention if you like the stuff that you hear in this video my course publish and
2:32
thrive which is a six week comprehensive self-publishing class just opened for enrollment today which is why i thought
2:37
this would be the perfect time to start talking about sales numbers and marketing strategies so if you're interested in that class click the link
2:44
down in the description box below and come join us we would love to have you in the class but let's get started with
2:50
my best-selling books sales numbers okay so we have switched to my desktop computer sorry the lighting is not as
My Genre and Series
2:56
good here but i am going to share some slides with you that have some of my
3:02
sales numbers on them so this is going to be really fun and i'm going to do my best to keep this somewhat short and
3:08
sweet so i could talk about this stuff forever and again if you're interested in knowing the strategies and all the
3:14
things that go into this because there's so much that you can learn that you can do to control your sales and what type
3:20
of strategy you use please come join us in publish and thrive i would love to have you in there but let's get started
3:26
so my best selling books again i write young adult paranormal fiction for the
3:32
most part so i will kind of switch here just to me being full screen
3:37
my first book was beautiful demons it actually had a different cover than this that i never had made into a paperback
3:44
but then i switched to the cover to this and that's one of the cool things about being indie is that you can
3:50
update your covers you can change your metadata you can change your categories there's a lot of flexibility on what you can do to market your books and continue
3:57
to keep them selling for years and years to come but this was my very first ever book in 2010 so i have three genres that
4:05
i have written in so i have young adult paranormal which really is young adult contemporary fantasy and i also have a
4:12
spin-off series that's new adult contemporary fantasy or new adult urban fantasy type edge to it i i guess third
4:19
genre would be that i also do have one series that's more like new adult romance and then i have a contemporary
4:27
romance series that's also new adult if you're not familiar with the term new adult that just means uh that transition
4:33
between young adult where you're in high school to new adult where you are not quite like out in the job world it's
4:40
still sort of coming of age but you're somewhere in the age range between maybe like 17 and 25 that's the new adult sort
4:46
of college age time in your life so i have written all of these genres and there are a lot of
4:53
reasons why you're going to do a lot better in your indie career if you can stick to one genre that is a clear
5:00
well-selling well-established genre but i don't always follow the rules because sometimes for me it's about my joy and
5:07
not just the book sales but you can see that because of the strategies that i've employed i've continued to be successful
5:13
across multiple genres but i did have one clear established genre and one
5:19
clear established series before i branched out into those other things so we could talk about this forever but
5:24
let's go ahead and get started with the slideshow so the place that i
Tracking My Sales
5:30
prefer and love to use for all of my sales tracking now is called scribe
5:36
count and one of the reasons that i love it is it has this beautiful interface so they call this the sunburst and one of
5:43
the things about scribe count is it is available for wide authors now to be a wide author means that you are not
5:50
exclusive to amazon or kindle unlimited your books are available widely meaning they're at apple books google play
5:57
barnes and noble kobo and any other major vendor and scribe count is one that you can put in all of your account
6:03
information and it's going to pull your sales data historically so it's going to pull everything from the beginning of
6:09
your publishing account any pen names that you've used all of that will be available here now it does also work
6:15
with kindle unlimited but you can use it also if you're wide so either way there are other places out there like book
6:22
tracker book report publish wide that you can do the same thing but scribe count is my favorite but i'll put some
6:27
of these links for you down below if you want to check them out so unfortunately when i pulled these screenshot off and
6:34
put them into the slideshow they got a little bit blurry so i've included
6:39
numbers in addition where i can but basically this is a sunburst of my entire career
6:47
since i started publishing in 2010 and i'll have a caveat in the next slide for
6:53
you because it's not entirely everything it's accurate for what's here but there are more sales than this and i'll talk
6:59
about why so the yellow is amazon and you can see that that is by far the largest piece of the pie but it's not
7:06
even quite 50 and then if you move on to the next piece that's apple books is the light
7:12
green google play is the light blue and then the teal green is barnes and noble
7:17
the red is kobo and then the dark blue is smashwords and so you can see that and if you really if you buy scrap
7:24
scribe count or if you use it you can drill down and you can see what countries which books were your
7:29
best-selling books there's a lot of data in here and it's just really really cool i highly highly recommend it so scribe
7:35
count is free for authors earning less than a thousand if you earn between a thousand and two thousand it's 15 a
7:41
month or 20 a month if you're earning more than that so um i am an affiliate for scribe count because i love them so
7:46
much but they are not like sponsoring this video in any way but because this part was blurry i pulled this little
7:53
square here for you to be able to see it in more detail so
7:59
this is my total income earned kind of and the reason the kind of is there is
8:05
because for some reason this is not pulling in all of my kobo sales so i need to reach out to their customer
8:11
support and find out why i'm missing like forty thousand dollars worth of sales from kobo i don't know why it's
8:18
it's not there the other um thing is that i had a barnes and noble account when i
8:25
first started they were called puppet and then because i switched my tax id from my social security number to my
8:31
business ein i had to close one account and open a new account so there's probably about 50 000 sales at barnes
8:38
noble that are not counted on here because i had a lot of success at barnes noble in the beginning actually i was
8:44
out selling amazon at barnes noble in the beginning of my career so there's a lot of numbers
8:49
that aren't accounted for here but these are the provable numbers inside scrap count so i'll use these
Total Income
8:55
but just know that they're actually higher than this so 1.2 million dollars is the total earned it's probably
9:01
over 1.3 million and 775 000 books plus so i think this
9:08
is probably at this point more like 825 to 850 000 and also as an aside
9:15
this doesn't include any anthologies or box sets that i've been a part of so throughout my career i've been in short
9:21
story anthologies and box sets with other authors where they're like hey we're going to do a full box out of all
9:26
like romance novels and i've put my book inside and i don't have those sales numbers here because they're published
9:32
by someone else with a contract and then they paid out royalties to me separately
9:37
so i don't have those full numbers but that probably accounts for another 50 to 100 000 sales for me so we're getting up
9:45
close to a million if you encounter include everything and of course this number 7 775 is only paid books i'm not
9:53
counting any books that were given away for free or anything like that these are books that people actually paid for so
9:59
i've had quite the career so far and hopefully we're going to hit that million moving up but i've shared those
My Bestselling Book
10:06
numbers before and i will include a link to that video about how i made that million dollars or how i sold those
10:11
books but what is my best-selling book and why so
10:16
we'll start with a discussion of what's my best-selling series so my best-selling series is actually
10:22
the first series that i ever published that beautiful demons book this top row
10:27
of books from one through six up to demons forever were originally called the peachful high demon series so that's
10:33
this book cover and they were completely branded in this way by um a great artist
10:41
called robin ludwig and those books were published between 2010 i first
10:47
published my first book in october of 2010 and then the final book demons forever came out in december of 2012 so
10:55
these six books were published over the course of a little over two years and this was the only thing i was publishing
11:01
i wasn't publishing side stories or different genres or anything i established myself in this young adult
11:07
paranormal contemporary fantasy genre and that was my main pure focus
11:13
when i published the sixth book i switched to a zombie series and then to
11:19
a contemporary series and i kind of switch and mishmash genres and we'll talk about how that was good for my soul
11:26
but not always good for my pocketbook so we'll talk about that as we keep going but i don't want to get ahead of myself so because this is my best-selling
11:33
series my best-selling book comes from this series
11:39
another thing to kind of understand is when we're talking about series and
11:44
sales when you have a series that has a trajectory where you have to read each
11:51
book to understand the next one then you're always going to have lower sales of your next book than you did of
11:58
your previous book so let me say that a different way when you have a standalone series where each book can be read individually and
12:05
they're not connected in any way or they're only connected by like a small town or something it's always possible that book 12 will be a breakout book and
12:11
will sell more than book 11 or 10 or whatever because people like that trope or people liked that character better so there's
12:18
always a chance with the standalone series which is what you find a lot of times in romance or mysteries or
12:23
thrillers and stuff like that but when it comes to what i call a dynamic series where nobody's buying book 11 if they
12:30
haven't read all 10 previous books because you would never understand what's happening it's kind of like one
12:36
long story sort of like any fantasy series like will of time or game of thrones or even harry potter like you
12:42
couldn't pick up book seven in any of those series if you didn't understand what was going
12:48
on previously so each book builds upon the next and because of the very nature of this type
12:53
of series the best-selling book is almost always going to be the first book in the series
12:58
because that's the first book everyone found now when it comes to indie books though that's not always the case because one
13:05
of the best marketing strategies that indie authors use is to set their first book in the series
13:11
free and then that brings enough readers in that they want to read book two book three book
13:17
four so that is why the very best-selling book in my series is shadow demons this
13:24
is book four of my series and it has sold 102 948 books and like i said this is not
13:33
even all of them because if you look down at the numbers here it says that kobo for some reason has only made a
13:38
dollar sixty nine but i have actually made something more like two thousand dollars on this series that on this book
13:45
at kobo so again i'm not sure why those numbers aren't pulled in but that means that this 102 is accurate but it's
13:52
actually higher than this plus those barnes and noble sales that i don't have accounted for here um so
13:58
maybe more like 105 000 copies sold of this book and this is my only book in my entire back list that has sold over 100
14:05
000 copies at the moment so i'm hoping i'll have another success like this sometime in the future but i'm super
14:11
proud of this and another thing that's worthy to note is that
14:17
even though i've sold 100 000 copies of this book and almost you know 800 000
14:22
plus books of my entire career i have never hit the usa today or new york times bestseller list because in order
14:28
to hit those lists they have to be sales within certain vendors on any you know a specific set of days and in the united
14:35
states only and i have a pretty global audience uk australia um france germany i have
14:43
readers buying my books all over the world and even though the us makes up the majority canada australia and the uk
14:49
also make up quite a bit of my fan base and those don't count towards those lists also my sales have been consistent
14:55
over 10 12 years rather than just one single spike and so they continue to
15:00
sell and this number that's on the screen that i posted yesterday is going to already be different today because i
15:05
sell copies of these books every day even ten plus years after they came out
15:11
so 102 000 copies it's never been free it's never been in kindle unlimited and
15:16
if you look at the percentages it's 99 ebook and only one percent paperback now
15:21
that paperback number i have a lot of potential there because i didn't even offer these books in paperback for many
15:28
many years uh because i was just so focused on ebooks but maybe someday they're gonna be in hardcover or
15:33
paperback so we'll see or they are in paperback but maybe i'll market them a little bit more effectively so amazon
15:40
kdp is by far where the majority of these sales are coming from then apple books google smashwords barnes and noble
15:46
which should be a little bit higher so barnes and noble's probably more than smash words but not quite as many as
15:51
google and then kobo books should be up higher so we'll reach out to uh scribe count and find out where those
15:57
numbers are but according to them right now it stands at eighty six thousand thirty one dollars
16:04
earned from this book now that number is not my highest income earned for my
My Highest Earning Book
16:11
books and sometimes you would think well if it's your best-selling book surely it made you the most money but that's not true because
16:17
the way that i marketed this series was very specific when the first two books
16:22
came out in october and december of 2010 i priced them at 99 cents because i was
16:29
a new author i wanted to get as many readers in as possible and i was less concerned about making a lot of money
16:34
and more concerned about i want people to love this series and so i'm gonna give it to them for really really cheap
16:40
and that was a great strategy back then i wouldn't use that strategy exactly now but i used that back then and it worked
16:47
great by the time the third book came out in february of the next year 2011.
16:52
i had amassed enough fans i didn't have a newsletter all i had was i think i don't even think i had a facebook page
16:58
all i had was a blog um but at the time there weren't as many books cluttering up these uh kindle
17:04
store and barnes and noble and so forth so the free slash cheap books was enough to get people's attention and by the
17:11
time that third book came out i sold 3 000 copies that first month of that book and that was my first book i had at 2.99
17:18
now when you have a book at 99 cents at amazon and barnes and noble and some of the other vendors it's always been
17:25
traditionally that you make only 35 royalty if you're below 299 or above
17:31
9.99 most of the vendors now have made it to where it's like 70 or 65 percent
17:38
like across the board no matter what your price is but there are still a few holdouts that pay you less for books
17:44
that are only 99 cents so even though i sold let's say a thousand copies of book one i had only made 350 off of that book
17:52
so far but when bitter demons came out i charged 299 which bumped me into that 70
17:58
royalty which meant that i was making about two dollars per book sold and i sold 3 000 copies in a month and i
18:04
remember very distinctly when this book launched going out to dinner with my husband and
18:09
coming back to the hotel we were on a beach trip and being like oh my gosh george i've made 400 in a day and i just
18:16
could not believe it it was so so exciting but now looking back on it i know that part of the strategy that
18:21
worked was not only the inexpensive books but also the rapid release and this was way before most people were
18:27
publishing this was 2010 so early days but i was so excited about these books and they were pretty short like 45 to 50
18:34
000 words and i was writing them quickly so october december february and because
18:41
those books came out quickly they gained a lot of momentum then book four
18:47
came out in july that next year so july 2011 and that book i made 17 000 in a
18:53
month when that book came out and that was like one of the most exciting as you can imagine like months of my life it
18:59
was so so exciting and i started to understand that like this could be a really successful year but part of it
19:05
was the inexpensive books in the beginning the rapid release the good writing the very well-branded covers
19:11
there were so many things that went into it also the naming convention having beautiful inner bitter and shadow with
19:17
the word demons staying consistent across them that was helpful because people could see my book and they could
19:22
tell that oh this is part of that series that i liked um and so all of that stuff is stuff that we talk about in my
19:28
publish and thrive class in terms of your strategy your branding your marketing your targeting and that kind
19:34
of thing so um i would love to get into it more here but hopefully you guys are getting kind of an idea of that but
19:39
anyway when this book first came out it was three or 299 shadow demons was 299. then as the
19:48
series progressed when i got to book six that first top row of books that was the
19:54
end of that series at the time and i moved on to other things and then came back to it and rebranded with calling it
20:00
the shadow demon saga instead of the peachful high demon series and started writing books 7 8 9 10 11 and now i'm
20:07
working on book 12. and at the time when i rebranded and started
20:12
writing a new you know the rest of the series in order to draw more readers in at the time i said i put the first three
20:20
books beautiful inner and bitter into a box set and posted them for free and
20:25
this is a common slash one of the most effective indie marketing tools is to
20:31
set your books free now i have a lot to say about this because i think a lot of authors do it too soon like i wouldn't
20:38
set book one of this series free when only book two and three are out i would wait until i had six or seven books in
20:45
the series to set that first book free unless it was only going to be a trilogy or only four or five books and then i
20:50
would set it free when that final book was coming out but some people jumped the gun and they set their book free too
20:56
early i think but when i had all six books out and then some of the extra books were coming out i boxed up those
21:03
first three books and it was a bit of a risk to box up those first three books because i was going to potentially lose
21:09
money right the first two were 99 cents but that third book was 2.99 and now i was going to offer it for free but it
21:15
more than paid off because the first month i set that box set free i made over 20 000 in a month and it was very
21:23
very exciting moment for me there as well because so many people that enjoyed the free books got really hooked in on the
21:29
series and really loved it so much that they went on to buy the next ones but that's where i go into the pricing
21:34
strategy because shadow demons book four in the series i set at 99 cents and
21:40
setting it at 99 cents was basically a choice that i made because i knew that people going from free
21:46
to 399 were going to be maybe hesitant to buy that next book for a big hike you
21:52
know hiking price so i thought okay i'm going to give them this next book because there's a big cliffhanger at the
21:58
end of shadow demons all my books have cliffhangers but or maybe they're not traditionally
22:03
cliffhangers the story resolves but then there's like a peek into the next book a little twist at the end of all of my
22:09
books my readers lovingly call them sarah hangers but almost all of my books have them
22:15
except my romances and there's a really particularly big one at the end of book four so i thought i'd
22:20
give them book four for 99 cents and a lot of people are going to read books five and six and that is exactly what
22:26
happened but because shadow demons was 99 cents for a long part of its lifetime
22:31
even though it sold a hundred thousand books it has actually made less than a hundred thousand dollars
22:36
now my best-selling book is the next book in the series rival demons so book five in
22:42
this series has never been on sale and it has always been 3.99 so i raised the price up to 3.99 and boom went from 78
22:52
or went from making eighty six thousand dollars with a hundred thousand sales to making a hundred and eighty three
22:57
thousand dollars off of seventy eight thousand sales and man that felt really good like going
23:04
through these numbers and again this isn't even all of it because kobo should be up there at like 2 000 or more
23:09
dollars barnes and noble should probably be up there around more like 20 000 or 16 to 17 so it's actually more than this
23:16
number so i'm getting close to having earned 200 000 off of my best-selling book which has never hit a best-seller
23:23
list just to remind you now this book in particular came out in january of 2012 when i was pregnant with my son andrew
23:30
and it did actually it didn't hit like a usa today or anything but this book actually was a top 100 bestselling book
23:36
of the year on google play books and on amazon's young adult list so i was very proud of that because i was only one of
23:43
maybe three indie authors that were on the list at the time but this particular book is my
23:50
most earned so shadow demons is my highest selling in terms of numbers and
23:56
rival demons sold less books and you can if you look at those numbers you've got 102
24:01
down to 78 so i basically lost somewhere around 25 000 readers in the price jump
24:08
from a 99 book up to a 299 399 book
24:14
and that is the way it's going to be so again part of the series trajectory is
24:20
that you're almost always gonna sell less of the next book in the series so book six sold less than this book seven
24:25
sold less than this and so on but also when you have a price hike from free to
24:32
paid or from 99 cents to 4.99 or whatever you're almost always going to see more drop off on that book than you
24:39
would if you were staying consistent in your pricing but sometimes that's the best marketing strategy to get as many
24:44
readers in as possible now book six in the series demons forever had a
24:50
huge sell-through i didn't grab a graphic for that but that has sold somewhere around 75 000 copies so i had
24:56
99 of the people that bought book five also bought book six and so it has also
25:02
in turn made me over 150 000 in terms of my income um you can also
25:08
see that less percentage only half a percent have purchased the paperback and i think that's because a lot of people
25:13
want those first few books but then they don't go on to buy the rest of the series because it doesn't mean as much
25:18
to them um if they're buying it because they want for nostalgia reasons um you
25:23
can also see because of the platform that i have here that again amazon then apple then google then barnes and noble
25:29
and so on down the road now the next best-selling book that i have
Another High-Earning Book
25:36
is um obviously the next best-selling one is demons forever but another book
25:42
that is up there in my top sales is from my contemporary romance series so this
25:49
is called the fair hope series it had a different set of covers on it before and i just recently rebranded them and with
25:55
this particular series i published this as my first ever contemporary series that has no
26:02
speculative elements or anything like that in any way in 2013 and this first book in the series
26:09
the trouble with goodbye is something that is a similar retelling to something happened in my life the
26:16
circumstances are very different but there is a lot more of my almost like autobiographical kind of stuff in it so
26:22
this was a very emotional book and the trouble with goodbye was came out when there was a big trend of new adult
26:29
romances however by the time i wrote this book that has a lot of emotion a lot of angst in it um
26:36
and no sex on the page the genre of new adult had already shifted that quickly like within a
26:43
matter of six months to being very heavy on the smexy time type
26:48
series like scenes and that was not my books at all so i kind of missed that trend and that is
26:55
one of the dangers of writing to trend now i didn't particularly like say i'm going to write to trend but i said oh
27:01
this is trending and i have a story that i care about that i want to write but i kind of missed the wave so to
27:07
speak and it was already shifting and that's one of the things that can happen when you write to trend you may see a trend today but if it takes you three
27:13
months to write that book which is totally normal if not actually fast that trend can shift to being something
27:19
different and that's what happened to me so this book was popular it sold really well and so did the subsequent books in the
27:26
series when i got to i think it was around book when i was publishing book five is when
27:33
i published or put book one for free so i published book one two book three is a
27:38
novella that was part of a collaboration book four when i was getting ready to publish book five which was in like 2015
27:45
i believe i set book one free and again i had a few enormous months 17
27:52
20 000 months which is just incredible but because book one is still free and
27:57
has been free for a long time book one is not the best selling book in the series and if you've been paying
28:03
attention you know which one is now even though these can be read as standalone books
28:08
the number one bestselling book in this particular series is book two the moment we began and one of the reasons that i
28:15
wanted to pull this out to share it with you is because if you look at the amount
28:22
of money earned for this book you've got 44 000 copies
28:27
sold and you have almost no paperbacks point one percent paperbacks
28:33
but you have 93 000 earned and this book is also an audio and has earned multiple thousands of
28:39
dollars in audio that's not included here but if you look at the platforms
28:45
what's number one by far forty thousand dollars extra is apple books so if i had
28:52
published this only through kindle unlimited or only through amazon i would have missed out on the huge success that
29:00
this book could have been now if you go back to rival demons for example you've
29:05
got 40 000 sales there on apple if you can see it there but it it for some reason this series
29:12
was just more popular this particular genre is more popular apple readers tend to like those more emotional books a lot
29:18
of times they also really love romance and so this book did particularly well on apple books and i just wanted to
29:25
bring that up because if i had not stayed wide this series probably wouldn't have done as well as it did so
29:32
here's another piece of that sunburst and all of that green is apple books like it's just incredible how well the
29:38
series has done there and i'm just grateful for all my apple readers there
29:44
now here's the comparison with uh the sunburst for rival demons which is
29:51
book five in the shadow demon saga it's not quite like amazon doesn't dominate it quite as much as you see apple
29:57
dominate this other one but amazon is obviously bigger there with
30:02
apple and google falling behind there now just to show you an alternative this
30:08
is my book sacrifice me so sacrifice me is a
30:14
spin-off series of my shadow demon saga that's aged up a little bit it does have sexy times on the page it's more romance
30:21
oriented and i published it originally as a serial so it was um short short
30:27
novellas that were published in a rapid release strategy and this series you can see has done incredibly well on google
30:34
play even though it's uh it's part of technically part of this series with
30:40
amazon it's a spin-off so you don't have to have read my shadow demon saga to understand it but look at the difference
30:46
between google play books on this ya and google play books in this new adult so if you are wide you
30:54
have this opportunity to be more flexible with your genres to be more flexible with which series
31:01
you're going to sell at different places because if you're only available at amazon or one vendor then you're really
31:07
limiting yourself to like this is the genre that does well there or whatever this is the series that does well there
31:12
and your other series might not do as well but they could have done better at other vendors so i just wanted to share
31:18
that experience so moving on to the next thing here is
My Bestselling Series
31:23
what is my best-selling series so we've talked a bit about this but
31:29
obviously you know because i've told you already that my best-selling series is the shadow demon saga but let's talk
31:35
about how many copies and again this is not completely accurate because i know that my kobo sales are not 100 there my
31:41
early barnes and noble sales aren't there some of my smashword sales aren't showing up but this will give you my
31:46
provable number which is over 537 000 books sold in this
31:52
series so this is 11 books at this point um and it has earned
31:59
896 676 thousand dollars in income and sometimes i see that number and i'm like
32:05
oh my gosh but remember that number 1.2 million it's like that is
32:10
you know when you think about it that is the majority of my income has come from this one series and i mean that's pretty
32:17
crazy and pretty cool and it is well loved and i'm a little bit nervous about ending it
32:22
because then what comes next and can i build a new series that people are going to love as much as this one you know only time will tell but this is by far
32:30
my best selling series and if you look at that sunburst you can see that amazon is where it has sold the most then
32:36
google play second and then apple books third and barnes and noble after my second best-selling series is my fair
32:42
hope series so when when you come down to the fairhope series here you have 130 000 books sold
32:50
with a 200 almost 250 000 in income and when you look at this
32:56
apple books dominates it right if i had not put the series on apple books it wouldn't be half the sales so i just
33:03
wanted to point that out because it's super super important my third best-selling series is my sacrifice me
33:10
series and that is the spin-off series there are only three parts in it but book one was originally published in six
33:16
parts and then each part of season two has three episodes each inside of it and
33:22
this series has earned just shy of a hundred thousand dollars and has sold 71 000 books now because
33:29
when i first published all of those individual pieces as a cereal they were all 99 books that's why you have such
33:37
little income in comparison to the number of books sold um but that also is part of what played into the popularity
33:43
of this series was the excitement of getting a new episode every two weeks and it was really um a fun like rapid
33:48
release kind of event for my readers so not as much money earned but a lot of
33:54
good books sold so those are my best-selling numbers for my my series so
34:01
let's talk a little bit more about why i think these series have sold in the way they
34:06
have i do have other series as well one of my series is called the eternal
34:11
sorrows series but that series has not sold as many books
34:17
even though it's young adult paranormal there are a few things that make it a harder to sell series number one it's
34:24
zombies which is not typically as popular in young adult like fantasy fiction you see zombies in dystopian or
34:31
like horror but you don't see them like zombies and witches so i did a genre mash up there that i really loved but
34:38
it doesn't translate because it's not as clear of a genre like you just don't have as many things to compare it to
34:44
that are witches and zombies at the same time so it just didn't play in the same way
34:50
now i'm i'm still happy with the sales of that series and i have some die hard readers that love that series the most
34:56
but it just hasn't sold as many copies there are three books in that series with a fourth book coming soon and we'll
35:02
see kind of how that plays out when the series is completed but for now that is not one of my better selling series i
35:09
also have a collaborative series that i did called the willow harbor series that's new adult uh paranormal romance
35:15
and for some reason those also just never really took off i think my audience is not as much into the
35:22
paranormal romance as others and i think that part of it is the collaboration there with other
35:27
authors of varying success just didn't quite play as well as we had hoped that
35:33
it would and then i also have a book that will become a standalone called deep dark secrets i had planned to make
35:39
it a series but i've decided to make it a standalone that book has sold maybe about 5 000 copies on its own and then i
35:45
have a book called the witch's key which i read live on youtube and wrote during the pandemic i would read a chapter or write
35:52
a chapter and then read a chapter live and that book has sold around 2 000 copies not including the paperbacks that
35:58
i sold in signing so that series hopefully will grow as i write
36:03
more books in it but as it stands right now it's been a couple years since i wrote that book so that plays into it so
36:08
i'm going to turn this around to my camera back here and we're going to talk about some of those results okay so
Takeaways and Strategy
36:14
that's some of the raw data of my sales and like i said some of those sales are even missing but that gives you a pretty
36:19
good overview of how those books have sold and i want to stress too that i have
36:25
never taken out amazon ams ads i've never done bookbub cpc ads i only
36:32
fiddled with facebook ads very very little and spent very little money on them so this is mostly organic sales
36:38
based on my release strategy and setting my first book free the other big marketing strategy that i used was
36:44
newsletter ads so if you are subscribed to any of those newsletters like free booksie and book bub and
36:51
um book betty and some of those other books that will and some of those other newsletters that
36:57
send out emails that say hey this books are on deal today or this book's free today or whatever though that is the
37:03
majority of where i have focused my marketing efforts is setting those first book free as soon as i had four to five
37:11
to six books in the series and then every time every month advertising one
37:17
of my free books on some of those newsletter places and getting as many people to download the books for free as
37:23
possible now some of that is getting more difficult as time goes
37:29
on one because so many free books are out there that it gets harder to convince people to download your free
37:35
book whereas in the beginning like everybody was looking for free books now because of kindle unlimited and other
37:40
things it's a little bit more difficult to get your free books in the hands of other people and then less people are
37:46
going on to actually read them and buy the next books in series so that was it's still a super super valuable
37:52
strategy but it's not as valuable as it was back in 2012 2013 it's not as like
37:57
gold rush capable as it used to be another thing is first in series free works but it never
38:04
works as well as the first time you do it so i highly recommend if you're gonna have a five six seven book series on
38:11
your hands do not set your book free until you have four or five books out in that series because you're going to be
38:17
just basically wasting your number one marketing tool way too early and i
38:22
highly recommend it's like a huge mistake i see a lot of people make because they set their book free and all they have is book two and they haven't
38:29
written book three four five or anything else beyond it and you will see that with my death awakening eternal sorrows
38:35
series i only have three books and the first book is free because i recently set it free because there's only one
38:41
more book left in the series and i want to get as many readers into it before the series ends but if that series was
38:47
going to be six or seven books i would not set that first book free until i had the last book about to come out so a
38:54
little caveat there another problem with first in series free that i see for sure
38:59
with my shadow demon saga is that that box that has been free now for five years
39:05
maybe six years and so it's been promoted so many times on all those deal sites on
39:11
my website to all my fans everywhere in my newsletter so it's harder and harder
39:17
after that's been pushed out there and out there it's had a book bub three or four times it's
39:22
harder to get people to download it so every time i run one of those ads i actually get less downloads than i had
39:27
the time before and that's one of those struggles when you have a series that has to be read in order but if you have
39:33
a standalone series you can always say i'm going to set book 4 free for a little while and then i'm going to set
39:38
book 7 free because they don't have to be read in order but when you have a series like mine that have to be read in
39:44
order your only option is really the first few books and because i already have the first three books free it's
39:49
harder to go bigger than that but i do have some plans like i said for hitting potentially a bestseller list later this
39:55
year which i would love to have your help with so be on the lookout for some emails sign up for my newsletter list
40:01
and hang out here with me on youtube if you're not subscribed please subscribe and let's see if i can get on this list
40:07
after all these sales i feel like i've earned it but i haven't actually hit those sales in the right given amount of
40:13
time so someday it's going to be there but i think that once you have a long series
40:20
that first in series free gets less and less valuable over time which is why i would say wait until you can really make
40:26
the most of it and maximize it and then advertise it until you know you can no
40:31
longer get any juice out of it another takeaway that i wanted to share with you for sure is that different genres will
40:38
do better at different retailers different series different types of covers and so sometimes it can be really
40:44
limiting to just go all in on amazon and i know that this is not the most popular opinion right now because a lot of
40:49
people are telling you go into kindle unlimited you'll make a lot of money but there's also a ton of people making
40:54
almost no money and the thing about kindle unlimited is there's a maximum amount that everybody can earn like any
41:01
individual author can earn you know a lot of money but there's an overall pool like thirty thousand thirty million
41:07
dollars or forty million dollars or whatever it happens to be and that's a cap on the earnings of all of those authors and everybody's kind of
41:13
splitting it and you've got that top one percent that's getting the majority of it but there are a lot of people down at
41:19
the bottom who are making almost nothing and we could have a whole video on kindle unlimited if you want to hear my
41:24
opinions on it but i'm i never judge anyone or get bitter at anyone for using it because it's always an individual
41:30
choice and there are many paths to success but i love being wide now if you
41:36
join my publish and thrive course you're going to hear strategies and stuff for kindle unlimited or for going wide and
41:41
it's up to you to make the decision that's right for you and i will support you no matter what you choose another
41:46
thing that i've learned over the years is that putting a lot of time in between
41:52
releases in a series is going to kill your series so it
41:57
doesn't happen for everybody obviously everybody's like george r martin doesn't write a book but every 10 years but
42:02
george rr martin also has hbo and barnes and noble and front row seats at literally every place you could imagine
42:08
books to be sold so you can't really compare yourself to george r martin in the indie world it's all about writing
42:16
the best book you can as quickly as possible and staying as focused on a single genre or a single series as you
42:23
can and for me you can see i switched genres then i came back to my original series and then because i was writing
42:30
multiple series at once at one time i had five series going at once it meant that every book in my shadow demon saga
42:36
was taking two years or more to write and come out and so if you were to look at that
42:42
hundred thousand sales of book four and then you go and you look at the sales of book eight nine ten you're going to see
42:47
a massive drop off in my number of readers and part of that is because i ended that original series and then
42:54
waited three years to come back to it and part of it is because book eight came out and then it was like a year
42:59
before book nine and then it was like two years before book ten and then two years before book eleven so
43:05
and here we are book twelve it's been a year since that last book came out and so that amount of time in between is
43:12
really i won't say it's a career killer because i'm still making thousands of dollars a month on that backlist stuff
43:17
but it's really nowhere near at the level that i was when i was selling 100 000 copies of that other book and so i'm
43:24
definitely going to use what i've learned when i start a new series to make sure to set myself up for a better
43:29
strategy so if you can don't stretch yourself then with lots of pen names lots of different series unless you know
43:37
that you can write five six seven books a year because if you're writing three series with three different pen names or
43:43
whatever then you're gonna end up having to write six books a year just to have a release
43:49
in each one of those series twice a year and twice a year as an indie is kind of slow compared to what a lot of people do
43:56
and that's just the facts of it so again we're going to talk about all this in publish and thrive and if you've really
44:01
been interested in this video i really hope that you will consider coming to join us because i have so much knowledge
44:07
to share that i would love to share it with you in that course we go a lot deeper on all of these things like
44:13
categories keywords how to set up your business your website how to come up with a strategy and that's really the
44:18
final takeaway that i'd love to leave you with today i know this video has been a bit long so thank you for
44:23
sticking around but strategy is everything throwing
44:28
spaghetti at the wall writing different genres trying on lots of different things flip-flopping around not really
44:36
having a clear idea of how you're going to market your books or what genre you're even writing in what category
44:41
does it go into when you don't really know those things and you don't have a strategy you're really stuck stacking
44:47
the odds against you and what i want to see you do is stack the odds in your favor
44:52
a lot of people out there will tell you don't write what you love you need to write to market you need to write to trend and that's the only way you're
44:59
going to make money go into ku right to trend you know whether you like it or not and i have seen so many authors
45:05
write stuff that they're not even interested in i'm going to write sexy romance even though i don't like to read sexy romance or i'm going to write this
45:12
particular type of genre even though i hate it or it makes me unhappy because i've been told that's the only way i
45:17
could make money people have told me my whole career that you cannot make money writing young adult but you guys have
45:23
just seen my best-selling books hundreds of thousands of books in young adult genre so don't let anyone tell you you
45:30
can't write what you love the key is to understand how writing works how the
45:35
marketing and publishing side of things work how siri strategy work and really how your readers work as well as how
45:42
those vendors work whether you're going to go all in with amazon or you're going to go wide once you understand the workings of it
45:49
you can come up with a strategy that allows you to truly write whatever you love whatever you most want
45:55
to write but you do it in a strategic way and you set yourself up for success and you stack the odds in your favor and
46:01
i would be so honored if i could help you to do that so publish and thrive is open for enrollment now all the links

out of this particular video i hope that you found this helpful and please leave some comments down below if you would
46:18
like to hear more about this type of sales number these types of strategies book covers how all that stuff plays
46:24
into selling books and i will be sharing with you guys later on this year some of what
46:30
my plans are i've been calling it project phoenix because my sales are really low right now because i have been
46:36
so focused on heart breathings and teaching courses and having a young child at home that i have not been
46:42
publishing so i only published one book actually i think i published two books last year but i've been so focused on
46:47
that that i have not been publishing and i have not been marketing and promoting my book so everything's just kind of been like dormant i'm still making
46:54
thousands a month but i'm not making anywhere near what i was four or five years ago and i am ready to go back up
47:01
to those bigger selling numbers to get another best-selling series under me and i know that i can do it because i'm
47:06
starting from a place that i feel like is empowered with the knowledge that i
47:12
have of how to set up a good strategy so i'm going to share that with you guys that whole project phoenix stuff and how
47:18
it goes because i have as one of my quarterly goals is to set myself up for my best launch ever with book 12 of this
47:24
series in q4 so stay tuned make sure you're subscribed if you'd like to follow this please like this video and

47:54
[Music]
48:13
you

hey guys welcome back to heart briefings this is a video that I'm a little bit excited and nervous to share with you
0:07
because I'm going to be getting real about my numbers as a self-published author and I'm going to be talking about
0:13
just how much money I've made over the last 10 years of self-publishing and sort of where that money's come from so
0:20
if you're interested to see how about 20 I've made self-publishing stay tuned ok
0:30
so this is one of those kind of nerve-racking transparent videos and I will go ahead and tell you that I
0:36
haven't gone through because it would take me a long time to get like exact down to the penny kind of numbers and I
0:42
haven't seen like exactly how much I've spent on advertising etc etc but I am gonna give you an overview that is
0:49
pretty darn accurate so what I'm gonna do is I'm going to take you through how much money I have made overall how much
0:55
money I've made from each vendor out there meaning like Amazon Google Play Barnes and Noble at center I'm going to
1:01
break that down for you then I'm going to talk a little bit about how much I've spent over the years on advertising
1:06
editors and that sort of thing I'm not going to get really granular about that but if you'd like to see another video in the future where I do break it down a
1:14
little bit more specifically let me know in the comments down below but for now I've got a tiny baby at home and I just
1:20
didn't have time to like go in and do all that math but then I'm also going to talk to you about why I think I've been
1:27
able to make this kind of money and make a successful career for myself despite doing some things a little differently
1:33
than others do and I'm going to talk about some of the mistakes that I've made along the way that I think could
1:38
have if I hadn't made those mistakes could have made a big difference and maybe even doubling how much money I've
1:44
made and I'm hoping will give me over the next decade more income overall in
1:49
my writing journey so let's get started so if you're new to my channel I just want to briefly introduce myself my name
1:56
is Sarah cannon I am the why of more than 25 self-published books so back in
2:03
2010 October of 2010 I started my own self publishing company called dead river books which that
2:10
is from a video game called EverQuest 2 where I played and met my husband George
2:15
and he is truly my soul mate long story short I won't go into my entire self-publishing story but in 2010
2:22
instead of going the traditional path like most people were at the time self-publishing really spoke to me and
2:29
even though the majority of people in my life told me it was a huge mistake and I was going to be ruining my career I just
2:35
heard this voice inside myself that said this is your path you can have control of your career you can get your books
2:42
directly into the hands of readers without the gatekeepers without the drama of traditional publishing without
2:47
the waiting game of traditional publishing you can write your book and immediately put it in the hands of readers so take a chance on yourself and
2:54
get going so I published my very first book now this was not the first book I wrote but this was the first book I
3:00
published it was called beautiful demons and I published it in 2010 so October 29th 2010 is when this journey began now
3:08
I started publishing at Amazon's KDP which is Kindle direct publishing and when I first started a lot of the other
3:17
vendors weren't even available to me so Kobo books wasn't available I couldn't get into Apple books or what was called
3:23
iTunes I think still at the time or it might have been called iBooks I can't
3:28
remember that that wasn't something I could get into as an indie author I also couldn't get into like Google Play Books
3:34
I don't even think it existed back in 2010 but I did manage to self publish
3:40
the very first month that Barnes & Noble had a self-publishing arm which back then was called puppet so when I first
3:46
started I published to Kindle and Barnes & Noble and actually found success at Barnes & Noble a lot faster than I did
3:53
at Amazon Amazon took a little bit of time but I published the my first book in October and not out of any type of
4:00
strategy but just out of pure desire and love and excitement for the books I published my second book in December so
4:07
I wrote that second book pretty quickly but these were pretty short books like 50,000 words then my next book came out
4:13
in February so something that I sort of lucked into in a way was a
4:18
sort of rapid release strategy now again there's so much to say about this so I won't get into it because I don't want
4:24
this video to be like forever long but that rapid release strategy of about two
4:30
months apart worked extremely well for me even in the beginning back in 2010
4:35
and it's still a strategy that works really well today however I think that some people are going kind of extremes
4:41
on it so if you want to hear more about whether you should rapid release your books meaning release them back to back
4:46
really fast please subscribe to this channel and make sure you check out my video next week because I am going to be
4:51
talking specifically about that subject of rapid release but anyway over the
4:57
course of the last about 10 years I have written and self-published 25 novels
5:02
most of those novels have been in the young adult contemporary fantasy genre I do have one series which is called the
5:08
Fairhope series that is a new adult main college-age contemporary romance series so that one's a little bit different
5:15
then I do have a spinoff series of my main shadow demon saga which is a why a series that is more of a college-age
5:23
urban fantasy type series so it's a spin-off so it occurs in the same world but that's basically my catalog most of
5:30
my books and definitely my best-selling books are young adult books so that's going to come into play in a little bit
5:36
when I talk about you know writing what you love and whether you can make money writing why so let's get down to the
5:43
numbers which I know is why you're here so over the course of the last nine and a half years I have made about 1 million
5:51
one hundred and fifty thousand dollars self-publishing my books and just saying
5:56
that like I know it spread over the course of about 10 years it's just so
6:02
exciting because when I first started out I remember that first month October
6:08
you know it was only a few days but that first month November first full month of having that book out I thought you know
6:13
it would be so exciting to sell you know even 50 copies and I told my friends and
6:18
family and it was only $0.99 book and you know I saw those little sales coming in and every single one was so exciting
6:25
and I remember saying George I solved another one you know just being that excited about it and I never really dreamed that
6:31
I would be sitting here ten years from then like with over a million dollars made in self-publishing which has been
6:39
made with $0.99 to 399 books I've never had other than a couple of box sets that
6:45
were a little bit higher priced I've never had a book that's higher price than four dollars so to say that I have
6:51
actually made almost 1.2 million dollars off of basically making anywhere from 35
6:58
cents to $3.75 per transaction is pretty huge so that's where we start so let's
7:04
kind of break that down into vendors meaning where have I sold those books so
7:09
here's the breakdown Amazon is at the top and this is the way it is for most authors and of course nowadays a lot of
7:16
people are going all-in on Amazon with Kindle unlimited and again that's another topic for another time because I
7:22
could talk about that for a long long time I personally do not put my books into Kindle unlimited and I have a lot
7:28
of reasons why but again another video for another time so if you're interested in that make sure you leave a comment
7:35
down below and let me know you'd like to hear my opinions about Kindle unlimited but Amazon is the number one and I'm
7:40
going to be looking down a little bit cuz I've got my numbers written down in front of me so Amazon I have kind of
7:46
broken down into the u.s. the UK and then everything else so in the United States I have made three hundred ninety
7:52
three thousand dollars on Amazon alone in the UK at Amazon I've made about 80
7:58
thousand dollars and like I said these are just I didn't go down to the cent I just went to basically rounded these
8:05
up or down then other which is mostly Australia Canada and a few European
8:12
countries a growing number of readers in India is about sixteen thousand dollars for a total of somewhere around four
8:19
hundred and eighty nine thousand dollars total at Amazon which i think is really
8:24
cool so that is my overall earnings and like I said none of that has been inside
8:30
Kindle unlimited so that's all as a wide author meaning that my are available why are available at
8:36
multiple retailers Kindle unlimited is when you go exclusive to amazon and that program started I believe somewhere
8:42
around 2014 or 2015 and has definitely gained traction in recent years moving
8:49
on to the rest of the vendors I'm not breaking these down into different countries because they're not broken down like on their website but my
8:55
earnings that Apple ebooks which again used to be iBooks and when I first published to them I published through
9:01
Smashwords which is like a third-party aggregator similar to drop to digital but they take a piece of your royalties
9:08
so as soon as I could I published directly to Apple so the total income at
9:13
Apple Books is somewhere around three hundred and eleven thousand dollars then Google Play Books which I didn't get
9:19
into until 2014 so several years into my career my total has been two hundred
9:24
thousand around two hundred thousand dollars a little bit more than that then Barnes & Noble which again I told you
9:31
was one of the very first ones that I published that when they became puppet and then they became new press and now
9:37
they're Barnes & Noble Press so they've had a couple of different iterations but my total income there is around one
9:42
hundred and fifteen thousand dollars so as you can see even though I had a good start at Barnes & Noble all the way back
9:48
in 2010 my income there and I think overall their market share has been dwindling in recent years so I'm hoping
9:55
to see a resurgence on that in the future but Barnes & Noble is quite a bit down from the others and then at the
10:00
bottom of the stock but still really important to me is Kobo books which has a more international audience I have
10:06
made about thirty five thousand dollars there so like I said I just kind of rounded these most of them I rounded
10:12
down just a little bit to give it kind of an even number that wasn't inflated because I didn't want to round up so
10:17
that is the total it brings me to about 1.15 million dollars so 1 million
10:24
dollars 150 thousand so when you look at the percentages there overall at Amazon I'm at 43% of my income has come from
10:32
Amazon 27 percent of my income from Apple ebooks 17 percent from Google Play
10:37
Books 10 percent from Barnes & Noble and 3 percent from the Kobo books but keep
10:42
in mind that even though Apple and Google Play are below Amazon I didn't actually start out
10:48
publishing there so I had several years where I published to Amazon but not to the other two so overall I feel like in
10:55
recent years those three platforms have kind of been vying for number one and I've even had one year where Apple books
11:02
was my greatest income of the year which is part of why I don't publish through Kindle and limited because if I was
11:09
exclusive to Amazon not only would I be making less money per sale or per download inside Kindle unlimited I would
11:16
also lose out on all of the income from other vendors so that is super important to me and one of the main reasons why I
11:23
stay wide in addition I have spent 10 years building up a loyal fan base and
11:28
amazing fan base that I super love and super value so to pull my boats from
11:34
wherever those readers read their books like iPad or their Kobo books they're used to buying their books there and I
11:40
pull them and say you have to only buy them at Amazon to me that just feels like I'm not treating my readers with
11:46
respect and this is no judgement to any author that has done that because we're all business people and we all do the
11:52
best we can and we do what's best for our own careers but I value community above just about everything else and so
11:59
I don't want to pull my books away from readers where they buy their books so if your entire book library's at Google
12:06
Play Books I don't want to tell you that you have to know come buy them exclusively at Amazon so that's just a
12:11
personal preference and one of the main reasons I stay wide but you can see that I do have you know more than 50% 57
12:17
percent of my income over the past 10 years has come outside of Amazon so that's super important and something
12:24
that I really want to put out there to let people know that it is viable to have a good career without going
12:30
exclusive to Amazon but this is not a video specifically about Kindle at limited so let's move on to some of the
12:37
other numbers so how many books have I sold to hit that 1.15 million dollar
12:42
income I also do not have exact numbers here when you go into the dashboard of
12:49
your retailers it's super easy to see how much money you made it's less easy to see the way that they do their
12:55
reports to see exactly how many books you've sold so I started putting them into a program I used to track my sales
13:02
every single day at midnight I would track them every day but once you get twenty-five books in it gets really
13:07
difficult plus I had a dip there in income and in book sales for a while and
13:13
it started to really like depress me I'm gonna do a video soon about my Dragonfly
13:18
story which let me just take a moment here to also say a little bit off topic but to say I've talked about my love of
13:25
dragonflies for a while and how it has had a super implica an important impact in my writing career
13:31
and for my birthday last week I got a couple of gifts in my p.o box that just
13:38
totally brought me to tears and we're so sweet one of them being this gorgeous dragonfly mug that says not all who
13:44
wander are lost and I just absolutely love this this came from Dakota rebel so
13:49
Dakota if you're watching this thank you so much for this gorgeous mug like this means a lot to me just that you are
13:56
listening and that you know how much this dragonflies mean to me I appreciate that I also gotta know you're not gonna
14:02
be able to see this probably super well because of the camera but I also got this beautiful little washi tape roll in
14:11
a gorgeous the handmade card from the Netherlands I have no idea who sent this
14:18
because there was no name on it it just had a beautiful message and this gorgeous role of dragonfly washi tape so
14:25
if you sent that please comment below that it was you if you would like or send me an email because I don't know
14:30
who it's from but it really touched my heart and I truly appreciate it I also got a couple of really nice letters and
14:37
a book in the mail last week so thank you so much for everyone who has said those so moving on but I will call my
14:44
Dragonfly story coming up I haven't give away going with that as well so stay tuned for those videos coming up but
14:50
like I said I don't know exactly the number and I stopped tracking my daily sales because it started to put my
14:57
focus on things that were not the writing and my love of writing so I don't have exact numbers but I can tell
15:03
you it's getting very close to 750,000 sales so last time I looked for sure it
15:09
was about 600 85,000 was the last concrete number that I had but that's been more than a year and a half ago
15:15
maybe even two years ago now so I may have even passed seven hundred fifty thousand I'm not a hundred percent sure
15:21
and that number and this income just to let you know does not include any like
15:27
bonus things that I've done so I've got books and anthologies and box sets with other authors so I'm not including any
15:33
of that income and I'm not including any of those book sales if I included those book sales of light box sets and things
15:40
that I've done with other authors it would be well over a million books sold and technically those are books that I
15:46
sold but I'm only telling the books that I've sold purely on my own merits with only my name on them because that just
15:53
feels a little bit more authentic at those about 750,000 sales the majority
15:59
of the sales have come from my shadow demon saga which is a young adult contemporary fantasy series this series
16:06
has ten books in it as well as a side novel called the demons wrath and a novella Club after midnight and then a
16:13
spin-off series called sacrificed me so this world has a lot of words in it a
16:18
lot of backstory and things like that and this is where my most loyal fan base lies now we will see what happens when
16:25
that series ends this year because I have book eleven hopefully coming out this spring and then the final book in
16:30
the series book twelve I'm hoping to have out before the end of the year I would love to publish it on October 29th
16:36
because that would be my ten year anniversary and I just think that would be like just beautifully like
16:41
symmetrical but we'll see and also there's a worry inside me that like maybe once this series is over a lot of
16:48
my fans won't follow me to the next thing but we'll just have to see how it goes and I'll keep you guys updated here
16:53
on this channel kind of how that works and whether my fans stick around but for now two votes left in that series and
17:00
that's where the majority of my fans have come from so that very first book I published beautiful demons that is still
17:06
the series that I'm writing and it's still my best self series so I don't have a breakdown of
17:12
exactly how much I've spent on my like artwork or my edits or my advertising
17:19
but what I would say that I've made $1,150,000 that is pure like gross
17:28
income so that's everything that I've earned except for the extra box sets and things like that so that's what I've
17:33
earned on my books then you've got of course expenses and this is where things
17:39
can get a little bit tricky because a lot of times right now you'll hear people say oh I made $20,000 this month
17:46
but when you dig into the details you realize that they spent $15,000 or 19
17:51
thousand dollars on their advertising because what didn't exist back in 2010
17:57
but that's very prevalent and important in today's marketplace is advertising so
18:03
not only do you have like newsletter type advertising like bookbub emails that blast to newsletter readers deals
18:10
on books you also have a MS ads which are Amazon ads that you'll see kind of below each
18:16
book in the Amazon store you also have book of CPM ads or book book click ads
18:22
which is where you're not featuring your book in their newsletter but your advertising like paper advertising which
18:29
is a slightly different thing and of course Facebook ads so a lot of authors
18:35
will use Facebook ads to try to get more readers and Facebook ads is the only one that I use but I kind of don't really
18:42
spend a lot of time or energy or money on Facebook ads I have a $3 a day ad
18:48
that's been running since 2016 so it's just one of those things that just keeps
18:54
running and keeps bringing people to my books but I haven't like done a lot with that so there's probably a lot more
19:00
there's definitely a lot more I could do if I spent a lot of time on advertising but I will just say that is not part of
19:08
what success is to me or what my ideal life looks like right now I would rather spend my time with my family time on
19:15
YouTube and time with writing my books than like spending hours poring over ads or tens of
19:22
thousands of dollars working with ads so taking out a lot of advertising is definitely a viable way to make more
19:28
money self-publishing but I also wanted to talk about the fact that my average
19:34
ad spend in a year is somewhere usually between three and four thousand dollars
19:39
let's say the average then for the past couple of years has been about thirty six hundred dollars for the whole year
19:45
that means I'm spending around three hundred dollars a month on advertising and the way that breaks down for me is
19:52
like I said a three dollar a day Facebook ad which times thirty days means about ninety to ninety three
19:58
dollars a month on Facebook ads then the rest of that money which is about two
20:03
hundred to two hundred and ten dollars is generally spent on those type of book type ad so what I'm talking about like
20:10
newsletter ads and we do cover this in my publish and drive course which is open right now if you want some information I've linked it for you down
20:17
below but those types of what I call newsletter ads are things like book bub three books see Robin Reed's book dummy
20:24
and those kind of places where readers have signed up to get deals so I advertise on those sites so I spend
20:31
about $200 a month on those and I keep a rotating like promotion schedule and
20:37
that's all I do in terms of ad spend I don't do a MS ads I don't do bookbub CPM
20:42
ads and I don't really do a lot of Facebook ads I would maybe consider doing more in the future because I know
20:49
for sure that if I did more I would probably make more money but right now I just haven't wanted to invest the time
20:55
and I wanted to let you know that it is viable and it is possible to have a flourishing career in Indy publishing
21:02
without spending tens of thousands of dollars a year on advertising let alone a month because there are many people
21:08
out there spending five to ten thousand dollars a month on advertising so I just want you to know that you don't have to
21:14
and there is a way to be successful without doing that so like I said about
21:21
let's say thirty six hundred dollars on average over the last three or four years on advertising in the very
21:27
beginning there weren't really many places to advertise so I only spent a very small amount
21:33
money like between 500 and $1,000 for the whole year for advertising my book and of course that has increased over
21:39
time and I expect it to continue to increase over the next few years the other big expense for me is of course
21:46
artwork so you're talking about all the book covers and that varies wildly from year to year because like right now I've
21:54
just spent quite a bit of money not only rebranding my eternal sorrow series
21:59
which the third book is coming out soon and I haven't revealed those covers but I've spent you know a couple thousand
22:05
dollars redoing those covers and then I also did a complete rebrand of my Fairhope series which I'll be revealing
22:11
those covers soon so that's six covers so I spent a couple of thousand dollars on those as well so that was a big chunk
22:17
of money that I've spent on covers but last year I also didn't publish any new books so I didn't need to buy coverage
22:24
for books that you know I was putting out because I didn't put any books out
22:29
last year I had a baby instead so some years I spend as much as five thousand
22:36
maybe six thousand dollars on cover art in some years I've only spent about five hundred dollars I'll cover art so it
22:42
varies depending on how many books I have coming out I also tend to buy book covers far in advance so I have plenty
22:48
of book covers to last me for a while so I don't anticipate this year spending much more if any more on book covers the
22:55
third and final like big expense category is my edits and again this is going to vary depending on how many
23:02
books I have coming out some here so I've only had two books coming out so that means I've spent you know depending
23:08
on which editor I was using anywhere from five hundred to two thousand dollars on edits or in 2018 I had five
23:16
books coming out so I spent several thousand dollars on edits that year so overall I've had about thirty six
23:24
hundred dollars a year on advertising and then if I had to say like an average for artwork and edits I would say four
23:31
thousand dollars a year on artwork and edit so that total equals a little under eight thousand dollars a year okay so
23:37
just a few more things that I want to cover so first of all young adult I hear so many people saying
23:44
you can't make money writing young-adult I have had people come up to me at conferences for the last several years
23:49
saying wow you're a young adult author do you make any money because everybody tells me not to write why hey even
23:56
though I want to because you can't make any money well here's your permission here's your proof I have made over a million dollars
24:02
writing y-a books as an indie author it can be done it is definitely a great
24:08
jean route to be in I absolutely love writing young adult fiction I don't know
24:13
for sure that that's what I'll write forever but I just wanted to get it out there that you can make really good
24:19
money writing ye now I do have friends who write adult genres like mystery
24:24
thrillers urban fantasy who do you make more money than I do but I also have a lot of friends who
24:30
write in those genres who don't make any money at all so I think that in the end
24:35
it's so important to write what you love writing one thing that my husband said
24:41
to me early on was write what you love and we'll figure out how to make money doing it after and I have really
24:48
followed that advice and it has served me well write what I love and then I figure out how to package it how to
24:54
market it and make money doing it and there are some smart things that you can do to package up the types of books that
25:00
you love or to write them better to market but I just wanted to get a message out there that you don't have to
25:06
write to trends you don't have to write something that you don't love in order to make money you can absolutely right
25:13
the types of books that you want to write now you need to be smart about it you need to learn how this indie
25:20
publishing thing works and how to market your books but you can write what you love and be successful doing it because
25:26
there is room for everybody in self-publishing and there are all types of readers out there so just believe in
25:34
yourself learn the business and you can do it another thing I wanted to mention now I have some videos about this
25:40
already but I'm going to be talking about this more in the future as well is that one of the biggest things that I
25:45
did write was writing a series now not all genres lend themselves well to series I know that
25:52
times in horror or mystery-thriller sometimes you don't you want standalone books like psychological thrillers will
25:58
often be standalone so you know some of those genres you can be really successful without a series but when
26:06
you're writing young adult urban fantasy contemporary romance just about any genre the name of the game when you're
26:13
an indie author is series and it just is so if you can find it any way to link your books together you're going to be
26:20
better off if I had not been writing this series of 10 books or more I wouldn't have this level of sales now I
26:27
think that I probably could have stopped this series at 6 and started a brand new series that was totally different and
26:34
still found success but when you only have two or three books that are connected or you only have standalone
26:42
books sometimes you're going to find it harder to market those books to the types of readers that you want to reach
26:49
as an indie author so series and writing a series is definitely one thing I did right from the beginning another thing
26:55
that I did right from the beginning I feel is writing what I love so many people out there will tell you this is a
27:02
business you need to treat it like a business and that is absolutely true you do need to treat it like a business
27:07
if you're going to be an indie author you have to learn how to market books you have to learn the business side of
27:13
being a writer and an entrepreneur however I get so upset when I hear
27:20
people say this is a business you can't treat it like an art you can't write
27:25
what you love you need to be writing to trends you need to be writing hard to market or you're never gonna survive
27:32
this kind of advice drives me nuts now that might be coming from somebody else's experience because maybe they
27:39
don't know what they're doing but I will say for sure there are some genres there
27:44
are some tropes there are some things that are going to naturally sell better than others but if you write something
27:51
that you do not love that you don't read that you don't care about hoping to make money just because somebody told you Oh
27:58
contemporary romance alpha male billionaires right will sell better than your why a fantasy then you are not
28:04
going to be happy period I don't know a single author who is truly happy no
28:11
matter how much money they're making writing books that they don't love for me the key is finding the most
28:18
marketable thing that you love to write and if you can find that sweet spot between what's gonna sell and what's
28:25
already established onra what's an idea that's going to reach readers that's going to intrigue readers and what do
28:32
you most love to write if you can find that you know place where those two things meet you can have the career of
28:39
your dreams but if you don't pay attention to the market at all and you just write stuff that you think is fun
28:45
but it doesn't really fit anywhere you're going to probably struggle but on the flip side if you write to market you
28:53
write to trends you hustle have some hassle as fast as you can and you're writing things you don't like and you're you know starting to turn to ghost
28:59
writers and you're pushing yourself as hard as you can you're likely not going to be happy long term you may make money
29:06
in the short term but I also feel that overall in the long run readers start to tell whether a writer
29:13
is passionate about the work they're doing or not so if you just jump on trends and you're not having fun with it
29:19
and you're not enjoying what you're writing you're probably not going to find success so if you've been sitting
29:25
in a position where you're like I'm writing to the trends and I don't understand why this person is selling better than I am well maybe that person
29:32
is really having fun writing what they're writing and they're really nailing that trend and they're passionate about it because some people
29:37
aren't passionate about those trends and they have fun doing it but you're in the slog and you're just like hating what you're doing and you're
29:44
just pushing yourself as hard as you can and you're you know burned out that's why you're not finding success and I
29:50
promise you you will find more success stepping back from the trends or the hustle or what other people tell you to
29:56
write and just writing what you love do it in a marketable way but write what
30:02
you love another thing that I did right was I focused really well in the beginning I was
30:08
one genre one series and I built my name and my career and my sales on that one
30:14
genre and that one series and that level of focus pouring my heart into something
30:20
that was going to be around for a while is what launched my career now that I've
30:28
covered that let's talk about some of the mistakes that I've made along the way because I really and truly feel like
30:33
I had a lot of momentum over those first five years and then over the last five or four and a half I have lost some of
30:41
that momentum because of mistakes that I've made so if I hadn't made these mistakes maybe I'd be sitting here
30:47
telling you about my two or three million dollar income instead so be it sometimes we've got to learn the hard
30:53
way and that way I can share my mistakes with you so you don't make them to so one of the biggest mistakes that I made
30:59
was doing exactly what I was just talking about once I started finding
31:04
success and making money I felt the pressure I've got to keep it going I've got to keep my fans excited I've got oh
31:10
my gosh I'm starting to make money I want to make more money and I started focusing on the wrong things now this plays very much into my Dragonfly story
31:18
that I'll talk about next week but the more I started to focus on only the marketing and what kind of right that's
31:23
going to sell better and how can I do this my attention shifted from really the fun and joy of writing toward too
31:31
much heavy on the business I feel like it needs to be a balance and I went out of balance and the minute I went out of
31:37
balance everything started to fall apart because I started making decisions coming from a place of fear and like
31:44
trying to control things so hard I was like squeezing my own joy out of every
31:50
single drop of it and the more my joy went down the more mistakes I began to
31:55
make so one of the biggest mistakes at that point that I made I mean that's the big mistake in general is that I got the
32:01
focus you know got out of balance and out of focus and lost my joy for writing but that caused you know a cascading
32:08
effect on my decisions so one of the biggest decisions that I made in a bad
32:13
way was instead of staying focused on what was working and what was really speaking to my soul eyes
32:20
and saying well maybe if you tried this series maybe he tried this one and then I had five series going at once so one
32:26
of the biggest mistakes I made was trying to switch genres as well as losing focus and putting out too many
32:32
series at once even though I was trying to find my joy again what happened was I
32:40
was writing five series but I'm not a person who can write more than five books a year so in indie you need to
32:48
have consistent book releases in a single series so when I was writing five
32:53
series I was only able to put out one book or less per year in each series and
32:58
that is just a terrible terrible way to run your career as an indie and I if I
33:05
hadn't done that who knows where I would be so learn it from me don't start too many series if you can keep just one
33:11
series at a time if you're a fast writer and you can write ten books a year then you can do multiple series maybe not
33:18
five but a couple or three series at a year but if you can only write one to
33:25
three books see here keep it to a single series or a single genre trust me on
33:30
this that leads to the other big mistake that I made because of that I took too
33:35
many breaks in between things and too much time off and of course I'm on the back of an entire year and this is my
33:42
first year in 2019 as a self-published author that I did not publish a full-length novel last year and I've
33:49
talked about this before because I had a baby we moved to a new house a lot was going on and I just could not get it
33:56
together to finish a book and I'm disappointed in it but at the same time I'm moving forward but taking breaks so
34:04
now by the time I get book 11 out it's going to been probably a year and a half between books 10 and 11 and every time
34:11
I've done something like that where I've had a really big break of 7 to 12 months
34:18
between books or more I have lost a significant portion of my readership and that hurts because right
34:27
now there are so many things pulling at readers attention very difficult to keep them on the line
34:32
so to speak or keep them interested in your series when it's taking you a year or two to get the next book out so les
34:40
and Lauren it's been kind of something I couldn't control every time but if I hadn't started so many series I would
34:47
have been able to be more consistent with my releases and I think everything would have changed so moving forward for
34:52
me one of my biggest focus like focus points is going to be sticking to a
34:58
single series and moving forward in a way that is more consistent and more
35:03
interactive with my fans letting them know what's coming when it's coming I'm really anxious to finish out everything
35:10
that I've got going right now so that I can start something brand new with a whole new strategy and new
35:15
moments of and new excitement coming from a place of joy instead of fear so we'll see kind of how those decisions
35:21
play out but one of the biggest mistakes I made was starting so many series and
35:27
then letting fear like when that joy got squeezed out of my writing career I
35:33
couldn't write and when I'm having fun and I'm really loving what I'm writing I can write much faster so it caused me
35:40
taking long breaks between things which really really hurt my career so those are some of the biggest mistakes and
35:46
some of the biggest things I did well and that is an overview of how much
35:51
money I've made self-publishing how much money I've spent on art and it's an advertising to get to where I am and
35:57
some of the things that I'm planning to do in the future if you enjoyed this video and would like to see other videos

seeing the sales that you want to see I would love to have you in my publish and thrive course like I mentioned earlier I
36:55

37:02
advertise your book because like I said I don't take out a lot of those paints I've paid ads instead this is basically
37:09
an A to C of how to give yourself a leg up and really learn how to strategize
37:17
what series to write how to figure out your keywords and how to get really good
37:22
cover art really good edits for your book how to set up your business how to check your sales and an entire module on
37:29
how to market your book then the final fifth and final module of this course is
37:34
all about how to thrive as an indie author so it's more about the mindset and the joy and how to really love what
37:40
you're doing and be happy in this career so if that sounds interesting to you I would love to have you join me you can

38:22
see you down there alright guys I'll see you in my next video bye [Music]

hey guys welcome back to my channel and
0:01
today we are gonna be talking about
0:03
something that I get asked a lot in the
0:05
comments which is how long should a
0:08
self-published book be so I've been
0:14
getting a lot more comments on my
0:16
channel lately from some of you who have
0:18
watched my how I sold half a million
0:20
books so polishing video and one of the
0:23
most common questions that I've been
0:25
getting asked is how long are most of
0:28
your book so I know this is a common
0:29
question and a lot of you are asking
0:31
that so that you can plan what length
0:34
you want to write your own books well in
0:36
my opinion there are four main things
0:38
that go into your decision as to how
0:40
long your book should be so I'm going to
0:42
talk about those four things that you
0:43
should be looking at and I will also
0:45
give you some examples from my own
0:46
career so as some of you who have been
0:48
following me for a while already know I
0:51
have been self-publishing tints since
0:53
2010 so I'm coming up on my eighth year
0:56
anniversary of self-publishing my first
0:59
book and so I have about 25 novel
1:02
self-published
1:03
at this point and pretty much they range
1:05
anywhere in length from I believe my
1:07
shortest book is about 20,000 words for
1:10
a novella all the way up to my longest
1:13
book which is around 120,000 words I do
1:15
also have some short stories that are
1:17
maybe between five and seven thousand
1:20
words each that are published currently
1:21
in some anthologies so really it goes
1:24
all over the place when you're talking
1:26
about average word count there is no
1:28
real average word count for any of my
1:30
book just in case you're not familiar
1:31
with me or my writing I write kind of
1:34
across a couple of different genres I
1:36
write young adult and new adult which is
1:38
college age fiction in both contemporary
1:41
I have one contemporary romance kind of
1:43
small-town series that's new adult and
1:45
then I have young adult paranormal and
1:48
witches demons really contemporary
1:51
fantasy coming-of-age stories that go
1:53
anywhere from young adult to new adult I
1:55
don't have any like purely adult fiction
1:58
out at the moment but that should give
2:00
you a decent idea of what I write and
2:03
like I said I don't necessarily have an
2:05
average word count when I first felt
2:07
published in 2010 my very first book was
2:10
about 46 to 47 thousand words thought
2:13
that it was going to
2:13
be a trilogy at first and so I planned
2:16
it to be just three books and they were
2:18
each gonna be somewhere around the fifty
2:19
thousand word mark and ended up that I'm
2:23
currently eight years later writing book
2:26
ten and my most recent book in that
2:28
series is about a hundred thousand words
2:29
and over the course of time each book
2:32
has gotten just a little bit longer
2:33
which kind of brings me to point number
2:36
one that you need to consider and this
2:38
to me is the most important thing that
2:40
you should consider when you're trying
2:42
to decide what word count you should aim
2:44
for with your novel which is staying
2:47
true to the story and writing the most
2:49
quality books that you can so pretty
2:51
much with everything that I talk about
2:52
on this channel it's always most
2:55
important that you stay true to the
2:57
story and that you write the most
2:58
quality book that you can possibly write
3:01
quality is going to be almost always the
3:05
number one most important thing it is
3:07
extremely important to write the books
3:09
that you most want to write the books
3:11
that are in your heart the books that
3:12
you are aching to tell and of course
3:15
there are going to be some other factors
3:17
that will go in to your decision of how
3:19
long your book should be but number one
3:22
thing to always consider is how long
3:24
does this story need to be for me to
3:26
tell the story the way it should be or
3:28
for me to do the story justice the
3:31
number one tip for sure is you have to
3:34
listen to your gut and your intuition
3:36
and your own training when it comes to
3:37
how long the book needs to be because
3:39
only you can tell how much your story
3:43
needs in terms of subplot and the
3:45
in-depth character exploration and you
3:49
know all of the different details in
3:50
your story now I understand that this
3:52
can get tricky if you're a newer writer
3:54
and you just don't have enough
3:56
experience to tell how long it needs to
3:58
be and that was the case for me when I
4:00
first started out so sometimes it's just
4:02
going to take trial and error for you to
4:04
kind of set a target for what you think
4:06
and then write according to the best of
4:08
your ability and see where you end up
4:10
but number one is I think that instead
4:13
of getting so hung up on how long your
4:15
word count needs to be focus on how much
4:18
does this story need how many words does
4:20
this story need for me to tell it in the
4:23
very best way possible the number two
4:25
factor that I recommend you take
4:26
into consideration when you're thinking
4:28
about how many words your book should
4:29
have is your genre so like I said I
4:32
started out writing young adult fiction
4:34
and that is currently what I'm still
4:36
writing and you'll find on the shelves
4:39
of Barnes & Noble for example young
4:40
adult fiction that runs the gamut you'll
4:42
find some of that's forty thousand words
4:44
and you'll find some that are a hundred
4:46
and fifty two hundred thousand words I
4:48
think some of SJ mosses most recent
4:50
books go well into the hundred plus
4:52
thousands so you will find kind of a
4:55
broad range of the number of word count
4:58
but sometimes when you go into another
5:00
section of the store like say epic
5:03
fantasy you're gonna see a little bit
5:06
more of uniform word counts which is
5:08
going to be sadly very long word counts
5:12
and epic fantasy usually you've got
5:14
multiple POVs you've got like the name
5:16
would suggest epic stories so we're
5:19
looking at two three hundred thousand
5:21
word stories sometimes when it comes
5:22
more to Harlequin romances for example
5:25
you may find more along the lines of
5:27
forty to sixty thousand words in the
5:29
traditional publishing industry you
5:31
definitely see editors and agents
5:33
looking for specific word counts not
5:36
only playing by old rules in the fact
5:38
that they still have to worry about how
5:40
long the book can be their printing
5:42
costs and that sort of thing but they
5:44
are also paying attention to something
5:45
that we as indeed writers need to pay
5:48
attention to which is the reader
5:49
expectations so over the course of many
5:52
many years readers who have fallen in
5:55
love with certain niche markets or
5:57
certain genres will definitely have an
5:59
expectation when it comes to how long a
6:01
book is going to be so the best thing
6:03
that you can do if you're writing in a
6:05
particular genre is do a little bit of
6:07
research it's as simple as a Google
6:08
search sometimes to see how long an
6:11
average book is in the genre that you're
6:14
currently writing usually when you
6:15
google it you're going to find some
6:17
information about what agents are
6:18
looking for or what the average is
6:20
because lots of writers who have asked
6:22
this question before so for standalone
6:24
romances you might find something more
6:26
like 80 to 90 thousand words but when
6:29
you get into maybe like Harlequin
6:30
romances or series romances you're going
6:33
to be down to maybe 40 to 65 as I said
6:35
earlier when it comes to young adult I
6:38
think the pretty average standard that
6:40
they're gonna ask for is about sixty to
6:42
seventy thousand words and then the big
6:44
New York Times bestsellers or if you
6:46
just write a book that needed that many
6:47
words that your agent feels is special
6:49
you can probably go into the hundred
6:51
thousand s with young adult so reader
6:53
expectations is something to take into
6:55
consideration however with that being
6:57
said one of the beautiful things about
6:59
indie publishing and self-publishing
7:01
your own work is that there are no rules
7:04
yes you do have to take into
7:05
consideration and you should read our
7:07
expectation because if you're writing
7:09
epic fantasy and the fans are used to
7:11
seeing really long sweeping stories
7:13
you're gonna have to come up with a
7:14
strategy for how you're going to market
7:16
those books if you're only writing save
7:19
fifty or sixty thousand words per book
7:21
you might want to go into it with a
7:22
clear note on your blurb that says this
7:25
how long the book is or that it will be
7:27
growing over the course of several books
7:29
or whatever but you might want to at
7:31
least consider that when you're breaking
7:33
the reader expectation for your genre
7:35
norm that being said it is possible to
7:38
completely break out from your genre
7:40
norm if you typically have these like
7:43
secret baby Harlequin style romances
7:45
that are only fifty thousand words if
7:47
you write one that's amazing that's
7:49
eighty thousand words you're not going
7:50
to have a publisher that's gonna say
7:51
well we can't publish this because it's
7:53
too long because you are the publisher
7:55
and that's really one of the biggest
7:57
advantages to self-publishing is that
7:59
you make those rules you decide how long
8:01
the book should be I don't know that any
8:03
publisher would have let me have book
8:05
one of a series the only 45 thousand
8:07
words and book ten be over a hundred
8:09
thousand words but I don't have to worry
8:12
about that and that's one of the things
8:13
that I love about it but I do think it's
8:15
important to stick to those genre
8:17
expectations as well as you can in order
8:19
to tell the story the way that it needs
8:22
to be told the number three thing to
8:23
consider when you're looking at how long
8:25
your book should be is advertising and
8:27
this is something that a lot of people
8:29
don't consider if you've seen my series
8:31
on how to write a best-selling series
8:34
which I'll throw a card up here so you
8:35
can watch that series of videos if you
8:37
would like to see it I talked about the
8:39
importance of you know writing a series
8:42
as an indie and how that can help you be
8:44
discovered quicker and to launch your
8:46
career but one thing that you need to
8:49
know is especially if you plan to use
8:51
book one of your series as a los Lee
8:53
meaning that you're gonna discount book
8:55
one over and over and over and continue
8:57
to push fans toward that book 1 as your
9:01
discovery tool then you need to be aware
9:03
of the fact that a lot of advertising
9:05
sites will not accept a novella or a
9:08
short story for advertising a lot of the
9:11
bigger sites like book babcom want you
9:14
to have a full-length novel they don't
9:16
want to advertise or feature a short
9:19
story or a novella so definitely
9:22
something to consider if you're going to
9:23
use that first book as your big loss
9:25
leader and your big advertising like
9:27
reader magnet because if you can't get
9:30
ads on that book you're gonna be in big
9:33
trouble if you just built an entire
9:35
series hoping that that one book would
9:38
be the entry because it's never as good
9:40
to try to drive readers to book two or
9:42
three because you want them to come in
9:44
you're hoping to attract new readers and
9:46
you want them to come in on that first
9:47
book so you better make sure that that
9:49
first book is something that you can
9:50
advertise everywhere and that means
9:53
making sure that that book is at least
9:55
40,000 words or more and finally the
9:57
fourth thing that you should consider
9:59
when you're trying to figure out your
10:01
target word count is how fast you write
10:04
now again let me state very clearly that
10:09
I always believe that quality and
10:11
staying true to the story should be the
10:12
number one thing but it is just simply a
10:15
part of indie publishing and trying to
10:17
make a living at this writer gig that
10:19
you do need to consider the market and
10:21
how you're going to market your books
10:23
how you're going to sell your books if
10:25
you write very slowly and it will take
10:28
you two years to write a hundred fifty
10:30
thousand word book then you're going to
10:33
either need to come up with an amazing
10:35
strategy that allows you to only publish
10:37
one book every two years and pour a lot
10:40
of money into that book and continue to
10:42
try to get it marketed or you're going
10:44
to need to potentially write short or
10:47
book so that you can get something out
10:48
faster and I feel like no matter how
10:50
many times I say this someone's probably
10:52
still going to comment that you should
10:54
never Trump marketing over your what you
10:57
should write and i 100% believe that but
11:00
at the same time i think that one of the
11:02
keys to being successful as an indie
11:04
is managing your career as market ibly
11:07
as you possibly can while staying true
11:10
to yourself and true to the quality of
11:11
the stories you want to tell and if you
11:14
completely ignore the marketing side and
11:16
you just don't even think about it then
11:18
I promise you you're probably going to
11:20
wake up five years from now having put
11:21
in a lot of time and effort and be very
11:23
sad that you did not follow through or
11:26
at least think about a strategy that
11:27
would help you find success early on
11:29
there are a lot of things that you can
11:31
do and choices that you can make when
11:33
you're developing your self-publishing
11:35
strategy that can help you be more
11:36
successful while also not compromising
11:40
your joy for writing your love for
11:42
writing and what you truly want to do
11:43
with your stories so going back to this
11:46
point about time and speed is an
11:48
unfortunate truth of indie publishing
11:51
right now as it is in 2018 that the
11:54
faster you can publish the better and I
11:57
hate that it's that way because I want
12:00
to spend as much time as possible to
12:02
make my stories to actually craft them
12:04
and make them amazing but at the same
12:06
time it just is the way it is and I
12:08
can't change that just by wishing things
12:10
were different so I have to keep my eyes
12:12
open to the fact that the faster you can
12:15
publish the better off you are now that
12:18
being said I always try to make sure I
12:21
maintain my quality so I'm constantly
12:23
paying attention to how fast can I write
12:27
the most quality amazing book that I can
12:30
possibly write so I have to give myself
12:32
that time and on average it ends up
12:34
being 2 to 3 months sometimes it takes
12:36
me six months there's a few occasions
12:38
where has taken me nearly a year to
12:40
write the best quality book that I could
12:42
write if you are a slow writer and by
12:45
slow I mean you can only write one book
12:47
a year or less then you are probably
12:50
going to have some challenges when it
12:53
comes to indie publishing one strategy
12:55
that you could try would be to bank
12:58
books so write a book this year hold on
13:01
to it have it edited go through that
13:02
process while you're writing book to
13:04
hold off on that one work on book 3
13:07
until you have a backlog of books or a
13:10
back list of books that have not been
13:11
published yet that you can publish one
13:14
after the other in a launch strategy
13:16
that would be one potential way that you
13:18
counter the fact that you need more time
13:20
that allows you to take the time you
13:22
need to write the quality book of your
13:24
heart but you're gonna have to be
13:26
patient because you're not going to be
13:27
able to write that book immediately and
13:28
put it out there another way to do it
13:31
would be to go ahead write the book
13:33
publish it and see what happens put as
13:36
much marketing effort as you can behind
13:38
it while you're writing book to but just
13:40
being aware of the fact that the faster
13:42
you can publish the more likely you are
13:44
to get pulled up in to Amazon and the
13:47
other vendors algorithms then you just
13:50
go into it knowing that this career is
13:52
going to take some time to build and
13:53
that's just the way it is that's
13:55
truthfully the way it is for most of us
13:57
even if you have three or four books
13:58
backlogged and you are ready to just
14:01
publish them very quickly you may see a
14:03
spike but over the course of the long
14:05
term for almost any indie it's going to
14:07
be work this is not an easy career so
14:10
have patience going into it but I do
14:12
urge you to try to come up with the best
14:14
strategy that you can so that you can
14:16
find success as quickly as possible it's
14:19
probably going to take several years and
14:21
that's okay at least we have these
14:23
opportunities available to us now that
14:25
were not available a decade ago so be
14:28
grateful for that understand the
14:30
challenges that are coming your way when
14:31
you decide to indie publish and come up
14:34
with the best strongest strategy that
14:35
you can so that you can find success as
14:38
quickly as possible so when it comes to
14:40
time and speed when you're publishing or
14:43
when you're writing maybe think about
14:45
this if you know you're a slow writer
14:48
then instead of aiming for an eighty
14:50
thousand word novel for your first
14:52
attempt maybe start with forty to forty
14:55
five thousand words so that you can get
14:57
to novels written this year now I only
14:59
say this with extreme caution it is a
15:01
great idea to write as fast as possible
15:04
to publish as fast as possible but it's
15:06
always important to maintain quality
15:08
maintain your story's integrity so if
15:12
you're going to write a crappy forty
15:14
thousand word novel or a magnificent
15:17
amazing best you can do eighty thousand
15:19
word novel always choose the eighty
15:21
thousand word novel that's amazing but
15:23
if you have the choice between writing
15:25
and amazing forty five thousand word
15:28
novel
15:28
and an amazing 80,000 word novel and you
15:31
are a slow writer then maybe consider
15:34
the 45,000 word novel when you're just
15:36
getting started and you're starting to
15:37
build your name so that you can put
15:39
those books out more quickly so those
15:41
are my four points and I do believe that
15:43
you should really consider those things
15:45
in order number one is definitely that
15:47
you should always stay true to your
15:49
story keep the integrity of your story
15:51
write the most quality book you can and
15:53
sometimes a story just takes as long as
15:55
it takes at this point in my career I
15:57
kind of have an idea of where I want to
15:59
end a story so I'm working on book 10 I
16:02
kind of have an idea that this one's
16:04
going to be around a hundred thousand
16:05
words but I am NOT going to stress out
16:07
if I end up at one hundred and ten
16:10
thousand words if that's how many words
16:11
it needed then I just go with it but I
16:14
try to have that kind of target in mind
16:17
and then when I get into the writing I
16:20
can sort of start to see like once I hit
16:22
that act one door away if it's 25
16:24
thousand words in then I know I'm kind
16:26
of on target for that hundred thousand
16:28
word novel if I'm thirty to forty
16:30
thousand words in and I'm only still in
16:33
act one then I know I'm gonna have a
16:35
really really long novel and likewise if
16:37
I'm only fifteen thousand words in at
16:39
the end of Act one then this story's
16:41
going to be pretty much on target to be
16:43
sixty thousand words and I kind of know
16:45
that about my writing at this point so I
16:47
start out with a target in mind where I
16:49
think this is going to go I plot it
16:51
accordingly because I am a plotter and
16:53
if you have not watched my series on how
16:55
to plot a novel I would love for you to
16:57
go check that out as well but I am a
17:00
plotter I kind of know what my target
17:02
word count is but I freely adjust it and
17:05
I just don't stress if it needs more
17:07
than it is or if it ends up being a
17:09
little bit shorter although I seriously
17:11
don't think I've ever written anything
17:12
that ended up being shorter than I
17:14
thought it was going to be it's almost
17:16
always longer than I thought it was
17:17
going to be and that's fine number two
17:19
of course is genre take into
17:21
consideration what do readers who read
17:23
this type of book traditionally expect
17:26
are you going to disappoint them because
17:27
this is like only half of what they're
17:30
normally used to in a book are you
17:31
writing a really really long cozy
17:33
mystery compared to what is normal you
17:35
don't have to use that as like a hard
17:37
and fast rule it's just good to have the
17:39
knowledge of what
17:40
leaders are expecting now I will just
17:42
throw in this as an aside is that
17:44
because so many indie books are read on
17:47
eBook a lot of readers have no idea how
17:50
long those books are I have had reviews
17:52
on some of my books that are 90,000
17:54
words that people called novellas just
17:56
because they read really fast or I have
17:58
really fast pacing in some of my books
17:59
readers don't know because they don't
18:01
have this physical book in their hands
18:03
so you do have that kind of going for
18:06
you or against you I guess you could say
18:07
in some ways but I wouldn't like worry
18:10
so much about well it has to be three
18:12
hundred thousand words because the
18:13
cinetic fantasy I would just keep it in
18:15
the back of my mind and have that
18:17
knowledge available that this is what
18:19
readers are used to so how am I going to
18:21
present this in such a way that readers
18:23
are still happy with the end product
18:25
number three is that advertising and you
18:27
just need to be aware that if you want
18:29
to advertise the first book in your
18:31
series or any book in your series it
18:32
should be at least 40,000 words and if
18:35
you're gonna write something like for
18:36
example I do have some novellas and
18:38
short stories that are shorter than
18:39
40,000 words like I have a couple of
18:41
novellas that are 20,000 words I don't
18:44
market those in the same way so I went
18:45
into it knowing that getting a book but
18:48
for example is going to be a challenge
18:49
on such a short book so I just market
18:52
those to my fans like on Facebook ads
18:54
and that sort of thing but I don't count
18:55
on bigger newsletter ads like book pubs
18:58
for those types of books and finally
19:00
considering how long it takes you to
19:03
write a book is something that you might
19:04
want to consider when it comes to your
19:06
publishing strategy overall alright guys
