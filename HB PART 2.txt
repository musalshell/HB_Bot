
hey guys welcome back to my channel and
0:01
today we are gonna be talking about
0:03
something that I get asked a lot in the
0:05
comments which is how long should a
0:08
self-published book be so I've been
0:14
getting a lot more comments on my
0:16
channel lately from some of you who have
0:18
watched my how I sold half a million
0:20
books so polishing video and one of the
0:23
most common questions that I've been
0:25
getting asked is how long are most of
0:28
your book so I know this is a common
0:29
question and a lot of you are asking
0:31
that so that you can plan what length
0:34
you want to write your own books well in
0:36
my opinion there are four main things
0:38
that go into your decision as to how
0:40
long your book should be so I'm going to
0:42
talk about those four things that you
0:43
should be looking at and I will also
0:45
give you some examples from my own
0:46
career so as some of you who have been
0:48
following me for a while already know I
0:51
have been self-publishing tints since
0:53
2010 so I'm coming up on my eighth year
0:56
anniversary of self-publishing my first
0:59
book and so I have about 25 novel
1:02
self-published
1:03
at this point and pretty much they range
1:05
anywhere in length from I believe my
1:07
shortest book is about 20,000 words for
1:10
a novella all the way up to my longest
1:13
book which is around 120,000 words I do
1:15
also have some short stories that are
1:17
maybe between five and seven thousand
1:20
words each that are published currently
1:21
in some anthologies so really it goes
1:24
all over the place when you're talking
1:26
about average word count there is no
1:28
real average word count for any of my
1:30
book just in case you're not familiar
1:31
with me or my writing I write kind of
1:34
across a couple of different genres I
1:36
write young adult and new adult which is
1:38
college age fiction in both contemporary
1:41
I have one contemporary romance kind of
1:43
small-town series that's new adult and
1:45
then I have young adult paranormal and
1:48
witches demons really contemporary
1:51
fantasy coming-of-age stories that go
1:53
anywhere from young adult to new adult I
1:55
don't have any like purely adult fiction
1:58
out at the moment but that should give
2:00
you a decent idea of what I write and
2:03
like I said I don't necessarily have an
2:05
average word count when I first felt
2:07
published in 2010 my very first book was
2:10
about 46 to 47 thousand words thought
2:13
that it was going to
2:13
be a trilogy at first and so I planned
2:16
it to be just three books and they were
2:18
each gonna be somewhere around the fifty
2:19
thousand word mark and ended up that I'm
2:23
currently eight years later writing book
2:26
ten and my most recent book in that
2:28
series is about a hundred thousand words
2:29
and over the course of time each book
2:32
has gotten just a little bit longer
2:33
which kind of brings me to point number
2:36
one that you need to consider and this
2:38
to me is the most important thing that
2:40
you should consider when you're trying
2:42
to decide what word count you should aim
2:44
for with your novel which is staying
2:47
true to the story and writing the most
2:49
quality books that you can so pretty
2:51
much with everything that I talk about
2:52
on this channel it's always most
2:55
important that you stay true to the
2:57
story and that you write the most
2:58
quality book that you can possibly write
3:01
quality is going to be almost always the
3:05
number one most important thing it is
3:07
extremely important to write the books
3:09
that you most want to write the books
3:11
that are in your heart the books that
3:12
you are aching to tell and of course
3:15
there are going to be some other factors
3:17
that will go in to your decision of how
3:19
long your book should be but number one
3:22
thing to always consider is how long
3:24
does this story need to be for me to
3:26
tell the story the way it should be or
3:28
for me to do the story justice the
3:31
number one tip for sure is you have to
3:34
listen to your gut and your intuition
3:36
and your own training when it comes to
3:37
how long the book needs to be because
3:39
only you can tell how much your story
3:43
needs in terms of subplot and the
3:45
in-depth character exploration and you
3:49
know all of the different details in
3:50
your story now I understand that this
3:52
can get tricky if you're a newer writer
3:54
and you just don't have enough
3:56
experience to tell how long it needs to
3:58
be and that was the case for me when I
4:00
first started out so sometimes it's just
4:02
going to take trial and error for you to
4:04
kind of set a target for what you think
4:06
and then write according to the best of
4:08
your ability and see where you end up
4:10
but number one is I think that instead
4:13
of getting so hung up on how long your
4:15
word count needs to be focus on how much
4:18
does this story need how many words does
4:20
this story need for me to tell it in the
4:23
very best way possible the number two
4:25
factor that I recommend you take
4:26
into consideration when you're thinking
4:28
about how many words your book should
4:29
have is your genre so like I said I
4:32
started out writing young adult fiction
4:34
and that is currently what I'm still
4:36
writing and you'll find on the shelves
4:39
of Barnes & Noble for example young
4:40
adult fiction that runs the gamut you'll
4:42
find some of that's forty thousand words
4:44
and you'll find some that are a hundred
4:46
and fifty two hundred thousand words I
4:48
think some of SJ mosses most recent
4:50
books go well into the hundred plus
4:52
thousands so you will find kind of a
4:55
broad range of the number of word count
4:58
but sometimes when you go into another
5:00
section of the store like say epic
5:03
fantasy you're gonna see a little bit
5:06
more of uniform word counts which is
5:08
going to be sadly very long word counts
5:12
and epic fantasy usually you've got
5:14
multiple POVs you've got like the name
5:16
would suggest epic stories so we're
5:19
looking at two three hundred thousand
5:21
word stories sometimes when it comes
5:22
more to Harlequin romances for example
5:25
you may find more along the lines of
5:27
forty to sixty thousand words in the
5:29
traditional publishing industry you
5:31
definitely see editors and agents
5:33
looking for specific word counts not
5:36
only playing by old rules in the fact
5:38
that they still have to worry about how
5:40
long the book can be their printing
5:42
costs and that sort of thing but they
5:44
are also paying attention to something
5:45
that we as indeed writers need to pay
5:48
attention to which is the reader
5:49
expectations so over the course of many
5:52
many years readers who have fallen in
5:55
love with certain niche markets or
5:57
certain genres will definitely have an
5:59
expectation when it comes to how long a
6:01
book is going to be so the best thing
6:03
that you can do if you're writing in a
6:05
particular genre is do a little bit of
6:07
research it's as simple as a Google
6:08
search sometimes to see how long an
6:11
average book is in the genre that you're
6:14
currently writing usually when you
6:15
google it you're going to find some
6:17
information about what agents are
6:18
looking for or what the average is
6:20
because lots of writers who have asked
6:22
this question before so for standalone
6:24
romances you might find something more
6:26
like 80 to 90 thousand words but when
6:29
you get into maybe like Harlequin
6:30
romances or series romances you're going
6:33
to be down to maybe 40 to 65 as I said
6:35
earlier when it comes to young adult I
6:38
think the pretty average standard that
6:40
they're gonna ask for is about sixty to
6:42
seventy thousand words and then the big
6:44
New York Times bestsellers or if you
6:46
just write a book that needed that many
6:47
words that your agent feels is special
6:49
you can probably go into the hundred
6:51
thousand s with young adult so reader
6:53
expectations is something to take into
6:55
consideration however with that being
6:57
said one of the beautiful things about
6:59
indie publishing and self-publishing
7:01
your own work is that there are no rules
7:04
yes you do have to take into
7:05
consideration and you should read our
7:07
expectation because if you're writing
7:09
epic fantasy and the fans are used to
7:11
seeing really long sweeping stories
7:13
you're gonna have to come up with a
7:14
strategy for how you're going to market
7:16
those books if you're only writing save
7:19
fifty or sixty thousand words per book
7:21
you might want to go into it with a
7:22
clear note on your blurb that says this
7:25
how long the book is or that it will be
7:27
growing over the course of several books
7:29
or whatever but you might want to at
7:31
least consider that when you're breaking
7:33
the reader expectation for your genre
7:35
norm that being said it is possible to
7:38
completely break out from your genre
7:40
norm if you typically have these like
7:43
secret baby Harlequin style romances
7:45
that are only fifty thousand words if
7:47
you write one that's amazing that's
7:49
eighty thousand words you're not going
7:50
to have a publisher that's gonna say
7:51
well we can't publish this because it's
7:53
too long because you are the publisher
7:55
and that's really one of the biggest
7:57
advantages to self-publishing is that
7:59
you make those rules you decide how long
8:01
the book should be I don't know that any
8:03
publisher would have let me have book
8:05
one of a series the only 45 thousand
8:07
words and book ten be over a hundred
8:09
thousand words but I don't have to worry
8:12
about that and that's one of the things
8:13
that I love about it but I do think it's
8:15
important to stick to those genre
8:17
expectations as well as you can in order
8:19
to tell the story the way that it needs
8:22
to be told the number three thing to
8:23
consider when you're looking at how long
8:25
your book should be is advertising and
8:27
this is something that a lot of people
8:29
don't consider if you've seen my series
8:31
on how to write a best-selling series
8:34
which I'll throw a card up here so you
8:35
can watch that series of videos if you
8:37
would like to see it I talked about the
8:39
importance of you know writing a series
8:42
as an indie and how that can help you be
8:44
discovered quicker and to launch your
8:46
career but one thing that you need to
8:49
know is especially if you plan to use
8:51
book one of your series as a los Lee
8:53
meaning that you're gonna discount book
8:55
one over and over and over and continue
8:57
to push fans toward that book 1 as your
9:01
discovery tool then you need to be aware
9:03
of the fact that a lot of advertising
9:05
sites will not accept a novella or a
9:08
short story for advertising a lot of the
9:11
bigger sites like book babcom want you
9:14
to have a full-length novel they don't
9:16
want to advertise or feature a short
9:19
story or a novella so definitely
9:22
something to consider if you're going to
9:23
use that first book as your big loss
9:25
leader and your big advertising like
9:27
reader magnet because if you can't get
9:30
ads on that book you're gonna be in big
9:33
trouble if you just built an entire
9:35
series hoping that that one book would
9:38
be the entry because it's never as good
9:40
to try to drive readers to book two or
9:42
three because you want them to come in
9:44
you're hoping to attract new readers and
9:46
you want them to come in on that first
9:47
book so you better make sure that that
9:49
first book is something that you can
9:50
advertise everywhere and that means
9:53
making sure that that book is at least
9:55
40,000 words or more and finally the
9:57
fourth thing that you should consider
9:59
when you're trying to figure out your
10:01
target word count is how fast you write
10:04
now again let me state very clearly that
10:09
I always believe that quality and
10:11
staying true to the story should be the
10:12
number one thing but it is just simply a
10:15
part of indie publishing and trying to
10:17
make a living at this writer gig that
10:19
you do need to consider the market and
10:21
how you're going to market your books
10:23
how you're going to sell your books if
10:25
you write very slowly and it will take
10:28
you two years to write a hundred fifty
10:30
thousand word book then you're going to
10:33
either need to come up with an amazing
10:35
strategy that allows you to only publish
10:37
one book every two years and pour a lot
10:40
of money into that book and continue to
10:42
try to get it marketed or you're going
10:44
to need to potentially write short or
10:47
book so that you can get something out
10:48
faster and I feel like no matter how
10:50
many times I say this someone's probably
10:52
still going to comment that you should
10:54
never Trump marketing over your what you
10:57
should write and i 100% believe that but
11:00
at the same time i think that one of the
11:02
keys to being successful as an indie
11:04
is managing your career as market ibly
11:07
as you possibly can while staying true
11:10
to yourself and true to the quality of
11:11
the stories you want to tell and if you
11:14
completely ignore the marketing side and
11:16
you just don't even think about it then
11:18
I promise you you're probably going to
11:20
wake up five years from now having put
11:21
in a lot of time and effort and be very
11:23
sad that you did not follow through or
11:26
at least think about a strategy that
11:27
would help you find success early on
11:29
there are a lot of things that you can
11:31
do and choices that you can make when
11:33
you're developing your self-publishing
11:35
strategy that can help you be more
11:36
successful while also not compromising
11:40
your joy for writing your love for
11:42
writing and what you truly want to do
11:43
with your stories so going back to this
11:46
point about time and speed is an
11:48
unfortunate truth of indie publishing
11:51
right now as it is in 2018 that the
11:54
faster you can publish the better and I
11:57
hate that it's that way because I want
12:00
to spend as much time as possible to
12:02
make my stories to actually craft them
12:04
and make them amazing but at the same
12:06
time it just is the way it is and I
12:08
can't change that just by wishing things
12:10
were different so I have to keep my eyes
12:12
open to the fact that the faster you can
12:15
publish the better off you are now that
12:18
being said I always try to make sure I
12:21
maintain my quality so I'm constantly
12:23
paying attention to how fast can I write
12:27
the most quality amazing book that I can
12:30
possibly write so I have to give myself
12:32
that time and on average it ends up
12:34
being 2 to 3 months sometimes it takes
12:36
me six months there's a few occasions
12:38
where has taken me nearly a year to
12:40
write the best quality book that I could
12:42
write if you are a slow writer and by
12:45
slow I mean you can only write one book
12:47
a year or less then you are probably
12:50
going to have some challenges when it
12:53
comes to indie publishing one strategy
12:55
that you could try would be to bank
12:58
books so write a book this year hold on
13:01
to it have it edited go through that
13:02
process while you're writing book to
13:04
hold off on that one work on book 3
13:07
until you have a backlog of books or a
13:10
back list of books that have not been
13:11
published yet that you can publish one
13:14
after the other in a launch strategy
13:16
that would be one potential way that you
13:18
counter the fact that you need more time
13:20
that allows you to take the time you
13:22
need to write the quality book of your
13:24
heart but you're gonna have to be
13:26
patient because you're not going to be
13:27
able to write that book immediately and
13:28
put it out there another way to do it
13:31
would be to go ahead write the book
13:33
publish it and see what happens put as
13:36
much marketing effort as you can behind
13:38
it while you're writing book to but just
13:40
being aware of the fact that the faster
13:42
you can publish the more likely you are
13:44
to get pulled up in to Amazon and the
13:47
other vendors algorithms then you just
13:50
go into it knowing that this career is
13:52
going to take some time to build and
13:53
that's just the way it is that's
13:55
truthfully the way it is for most of us
13:57
even if you have three or four books
13:58
backlogged and you are ready to just
14:01
publish them very quickly you may see a
14:03
spike but over the course of the long
14:05
term for almost any indie it's going to
14:07
be work this is not an easy career so
14:10
have patience going into it but I do
14:12
urge you to try to come up with the best
14:14
strategy that you can so that you can
14:16
find success as quickly as possible it's
14:19
probably going to take several years and
14:21
that's okay at least we have these
14:23
opportunities available to us now that
14:25
were not available a decade ago so be
14:28
grateful for that understand the
14:30
challenges that are coming your way when
14:31
you decide to indie publish and come up
14:34
with the best strongest strategy that
14:35
you can so that you can find success as
14:38
quickly as possible so when it comes to
14:40
time and speed when you're publishing or
14:43
when you're writing maybe think about
14:45
this if you know you're a slow writer
14:48
then instead of aiming for an eighty
14:50
thousand word novel for your first
14:52
attempt maybe start with forty to forty
14:55
five thousand words so that you can get
14:57
to novels written this year now I only
14:59
say this with extreme caution it is a
15:01
great idea to write as fast as possible
15:04
to publish as fast as possible but it's
15:06
always important to maintain quality
15:08
maintain your story's integrity so if
15:12
you're going to write a crappy forty
15:14
thousand word novel or a magnificent
15:17
amazing best you can do eighty thousand
15:19
word novel always choose the eighty
15:21
thousand word novel that's amazing but
15:23
if you have the choice between writing
15:25
and amazing forty five thousand word
15:28
novel
15:28
and an amazing 80,000 word novel and you
15:31
are a slow writer then maybe consider
15:34
the 45,000 word novel when you're just
15:36
getting started and you're starting to
15:37
build your name so that you can put
15:39
those books out more quickly so those
15:41
are my four points and I do believe that
15:43
you should really consider those things
15:45
in order number one is definitely that
15:47
you should always stay true to your
15:49
story keep the integrity of your story
15:51
write the most quality book you can and
15:53
sometimes a story just takes as long as
15:55
it takes at this point in my career I
15:57
kind of have an idea of where I want to
15:59
end a story so I'm working on book 10 I
16:02
kind of have an idea that this one's
16:04
going to be around a hundred thousand
16:05
words but I am NOT going to stress out
16:07
if I end up at one hundred and ten
16:10
thousand words if that's how many words
16:11
it needed then I just go with it but I
16:14
try to have that kind of target in mind
16:17
and then when I get into the writing I
16:20
can sort of start to see like once I hit
16:22
that act one door away if it's 25
16:24
thousand words in then I know I'm kind
16:26
of on target for that hundred thousand
16:28
word novel if I'm thirty to forty
16:30
thousand words in and I'm only still in
16:33
act one then I know I'm gonna have a
16:35
really really long novel and likewise if
16:37
I'm only fifteen thousand words in at
16:39
the end of Act one then this story's
16:41
going to be pretty much on target to be
16:43
sixty thousand words and I kind of know
16:45
that about my writing at this point so I
16:47
start out with a target in mind where I
16:49
think this is going to go I plot it
16:51
accordingly because I am a plotter and
16:53
if you have not watched my series on how
16:55
to plot a novel I would love for you to
16:57
go check that out as well but I am a
17:00
plotter I kind of know what my target
17:02
word count is but I freely adjust it and
17:05
I just don't stress if it needs more
17:07
than it is or if it ends up being a
17:09
little bit shorter although I seriously
17:11
don't think I've ever written anything
17:12
that ended up being shorter than I
17:14
thought it was going to be it's almost
17:16
always longer than I thought it was
17:17
going to be and that's fine number two
17:19
of course is genre take into
17:21
consideration what do readers who read
17:23
this type of book traditionally expect
17:26
are you going to disappoint them because
17:27
this is like only half of what they're
17:30
normally used to in a book are you
17:31
writing a really really long cozy
17:33
mystery compared to what is normal you
17:35
don't have to use that as like a hard
17:37
and fast rule it's just good to have the
17:39
knowledge of what
17:40
leaders are expecting now I will just
17:42
throw in this as an aside is that
17:44
because so many indie books are read on
17:47
eBook a lot of readers have no idea how
17:50
long those books are I have had reviews
17:52
on some of my books that are 90,000
17:54
words that people called novellas just
17:56
because they read really fast or I have
17:58
really fast pacing in some of my books
17:59
readers don't know because they don't
18:01
have this physical book in their hands
18:03
so you do have that kind of going for
18:06
you or against you I guess you could say
18:07
in some ways but I wouldn't like worry
18:10
so much about well it has to be three
18:12
hundred thousand words because the
18:13
cinetic fantasy I would just keep it in
18:15
the back of my mind and have that
18:17
knowledge available that this is what
18:19
readers are used to so how am I going to
18:21
present this in such a way that readers
18:23
are still happy with the end product
18:25
number three is that advertising and you
18:27
just need to be aware that if you want
18:29
to advertise the first book in your
18:31
series or any book in your series it
18:32
should be at least 40,000 words and if
18:35
you're gonna write something like for
18:36
example I do have some novellas and
18:38
short stories that are shorter than
18:39
40,000 words like I have a couple of
18:41
novellas that are 20,000 words I don't
18:44
market those in the same way so I went
18:45
into it knowing that getting a book but
18:48
for example is going to be a challenge
18:49
on such a short book so I just market
18:52
those to my fans like on Facebook ads
18:54
and that sort of thing but I don't count
18:55
on bigger newsletter ads like book pubs
18:58
for those types of books and finally
19:00
considering how long it takes you to
19:03
write a book is something that you might
19:04
want to consider when it comes to your
19:06
publishing strategy overall alright guys
19:08

[Music]
everybody Sarah here from heart
0:08
breathing's and I am here to show you
0:10
how I use my travelers notebook and my
0:13
hobo Nietzsche as a writer here's going
0:16
to be just a basic overview this is my
0:19
chic Sparrow it is a leather travelers
0:23
notebook and an a5 size this is the mr.
0:26
Darcy but you can get lots of different
0:27
travelers notebooks there are ones that
0:30
are made of cloth and stuff if you don't
0:31
like leather and there are ones that are
0:33
made of leather I think this one costs a
0:35
little over a hundred dollars and I
0:37
absolutely love it I also was able to
0:39
get it monogrammed here or stamped with
0:42
the word believe' which is also your on
0:44
my tattoo it's just one of my favorite
0:46
things and I'm going to show you real
0:48
quick how I use it as a writer so just a
0:52
simple explanation of my setup is I have
0:55
a few things here that I use all the
0:57
time I've got a stencil here that I use
1:00
with my hope and Ichi this is actually
1:02
one of their hope and Ichi stencils so I
1:04
use that a lot it just slides right in
1:06
there and I also have some other
1:09
stencils that I use I just got these off
1:12
Amazon and I can link them down below
1:14
but they have a lot of great icons here
1:16
like I use this yoga one a lot and
1:18
exercise one a little coffee cup some
1:21
weather icons stuff like that
1:23
and then I also have like text boxes
1:26
some checklists this one's kind of cool
1:29
because it has some of the social media
1:30
icons there which are nice for when
1:33
you're doing like a bullet journal or
1:35
hobo Nietzsche some other like flags and
1:38
things and then this one is probably the
1:40
one I use the most I don't I use the
1:42
checkboxes often but I also use like the
1:45
little camera the video for recording so
1:48
it has also some of the social media
1:50
icons but they're smaller and I use like
1:54
the little pencil and the computer
1:57
monitor the TV the podcast for when I'm
1:59
recording stuff so this one I use a lot
2:01
and I got this this was something I got
2:05
from Michaels and it was in another like
2:07
stencil pack so I just keep those sort
2:10
of tucked
2:11
in this little pocket here I have some
2:16
extra washi tape just like stuck on to
2:18
an old like still one of those store
2:21
loyalty cards just for on-the-go and I
2:25
have a clear Kate Spade ruler that I use
2:29
all the time as well to keep my lines
2:30
straight and just some little stickers
2:33
and stuff so that's basically my main
2:35
tools I also keep in the pen loop here a
2:37
Eunice style fit multi pin which I like
2:40
to have the multi pin because you can
2:42
have five different colors so if you
2:44
want a color code anything you can just
2:47
use one pen instead of having to carry
2:50
several so here's my basic set up if
2:52
you're not familiar with the travelers
2:54
notebook it's a notebook of notebooks so
2:56
to speak it's kind of something that you
2:58
can put multiple notebooks inside up and
3:00
they have lots of different sizes so
3:02
that's a whole nother rabbit hole you
3:03
could go down if you are not familiar
3:05
with traveler's notebooks but basically
3:08
I have the a5 size which is basically
3:10
like half size of a sheet of paper and I
3:13
have purchased notebooks and there are
3:16
these elastic bands that come pre built
3:19
into the travelers notebook that you
3:21
just open your notebook in the middle
3:23
and slide them into so you can see the
3:25
bandhas here in the middle
3:27
I made some dash boards and things like
3:28
that if you're interested in seeing how
3:31
I made these I would be happy to do
3:33
another video but for now I'm just going
3:34
to talk about how I use it productivity
3:36
level so I have four different notebooks
3:39
in the four elastics here and the first
3:43
one is one I actually just added new
3:47
notebooks so these are not super full
3:49
because my last ones were completely
3:51
full but this one is one where I plan to
3:53
take notes on plot ideas as they come to
3:56
me
3:56
I'm already through plotting a book so
3:59
until I need to use it again I probably
4:01
won't use this particular notebook until
4:03
I'm ready to plot but I keep one in here
4:05
always for plotting and then on my
4:07
dashboards I have some little sticky
4:09
notes that help also so in my second
4:12
notebook this is just my brainstorming
4:15
notes so this is different from plotting
4:16
this is sort of more of a brain dump
4:19
where I keep like notes on pin names if
4:23
I ever wanted to use
4:25
pen-name I really really want to use pen
4:28
named someday to write mysteries because
4:30
I don't think that it would really go
4:32
under my same Sara Canon name because
4:34
it's just a little bit different
4:35
audience I think so I kind of
4:38
brainstormed some of that different to
4:40
do different thoughts about different
4:42
series potential genres that I might
4:44
want to write I've been thinking about
4:45
doing a web serial and so there's you
4:48
know ideas for potential genres so any
4:50
time I think of something that I want to
4:51
keep for later I put it in the second
4:53
notebook then my third notebook here is
4:58
more for like scheduling so I've been
5:01
doing something called a miracle morning
5:03
you can find the book on Amazon or I can
5:05
link it below by how elrod and it's
5:07
about getting up basically an hour early
5:10
and doing exercise journaling
5:12
affirmations visualization reading and
5:14
meditation I do my meditation after I
5:16
shower in the mornings but I've been
5:18
getting up to do this and it's actually
5:19
helping a lot with my productivity but I
5:21
keep my little schedule in here then I
5:23
have sort of brainstormed what my ideal
5:27
weekly schedule is in terms of social
5:29
media and how much I want to write and
5:30
how many days so I keep that as a
5:32
reference as well so those kind of
5:34
scheduling notes are in that notebook
5:35
then I have another notebook here that
5:38
is specifically for my new heart
5:39
breathing's blog and it has you know
5:44
blog post idea notes has YouTube idea
5:47
notes for videos I want to record just
5:49
general notes on how I want to run the
5:51
blog I've done some interviews with
5:54
people that I think might be interested
5:56
in the blog to see what they want out of
5:58
it what kind of things they'd like for
6:00
me to cover so I keep all those notes in
6:01
this one place when I was looking for
6:04
music for my intro
6:05
I kept notes of that kind of stuff all
6:07
in here so these are kind of really all
6:09
for sort of brain no brain dump notes
6:12
and ideas notebooks then tucked in this
6:15
back pocket here instead of using the
6:18
elastic I have the hope of Nietzsche
6:20
techo cousin which is the a5 size of the
6:24
hobo Nietzsche and then I have a pencil
6:25
board here that helps you can put it
6:27
behind the page so that you can use it
6:30
to write on it kind of gives you that
6:31
like back page to write on okay so I
6:34
keep it tucked in back here but this
6:38
if you're not familiar with it is a
6:40
Japanese planner and one of the reasons
6:42
that I switched from the Erin Condren
6:44
planner and I was also using the happy
6:47
planner for a while
6:48
is because this planner is one of the
6:51
only ones I've ever found that actually
6:53
has like a yearly view monthly view a
6:59
weekly view and a daily view it's got
7:02
all of that stuff like most calendars
7:03
they've got maybe like a monthly and
7:05
then a weekly but there's no daily page
7:07
and I find when I'm organizing my
7:09
business and my writing I like to keep
7:11
track of my daily word count my daily
7:14
to-do list and I really liked using a
7:17
bullet journal so this kind of gives me
7:19
best of both worlds scenario where I
7:21
kind of get the feel of a bullet journal
7:24
with the daily page but I also get the
7:27
feel of a structured planner because I
7:31
felt like with the bullet journal I was
7:32
constantly drawing things in that took
7:35
forever and I loved it and it's
7:36
beautiful but it just took too much time
7:38
so this really works for me
7:39
and it does have a year at a glance for
7:41
last year and next year then it has this
7:45
index where you've got really it's
7:49
supposed to be used as an index and you
7:50
can kind of see here on these like the
7:52
second half of the year where I haven't
7:54
marked anything yet this is what it
7:56
looks like and and it has the months
7:58
here at the top so like 7 July August
8:00
September and so on and then it has the
8:02
days written here with a little block
8:04
down at the bottom and I was trying to
8:06
think how best could I use this because
8:08
I don't really need an index to be able
8:09
to like turn to this page and find you
8:13
know certain notes or some kind of
8:15
information so I decided to use this as
8:18
a yearly word count tracker and a habit
8:22
tracker
8:22
so what I did was I left enough spaces
8:25
here at the beginning blocks for 5
8:27
spaces which on my best day I can get a
8:31
five-figure word count my average is
8:33
more like maybe a thousand to 2,000
8:35
words a day unless I'm like going crazy
8:36
but anyway regardless of that I leave 5
8:39
spaces because I do have sometimes days
8:41
where I get 10,000 words or more so I
8:45
get 5 spaces here then I blocked off
8:47
like I just took my ruler
8:49
and made a black line for this on either
8:52
side of this one block and then I
8:56
colored it in with a mild liner zebra
9:00
mild liner highlighter and then I also
9:03
marked off the weeks so each one of
9:06
these blocks is a seven-day week and you
9:08
can see this some you know some of the
9:10
months it doesn't work out exactly like
9:11
a week but what I do and you can see
9:15
this hopefully pretty well with January
9:17
is I put my main goals up here I have
9:21
three my three main goals like to do
9:23
this month go right up here then in the
9:28
middle I've written weekly total for my
9:31
weekly word count and then over here
9:33
I've got four things that I'm going to
9:35
be tracking so I've just decided at the
9:38
beginning of each month what I want to
9:39
track and January February I've been
9:40
tracking the same thing so DBT see is
9:43
don't break the chain that's a challenge
9:45
I've got going on in a writers group
9:47
that I run called whirlwind of words
9:48
where we mostly sprint but it's
9:51
basically like write at least a hundred
9:53
words every day edit a full page or do
9:57
like 30 minutes of outlining so don't
10:01
break the chain do at least one of those
10:02
three things every single day either
10:04
edits outlining or words so that you're
10:07
getting some progress on your book every
10:11
day then bright lines for me is a more
10:14
personal thing to track because I do a
10:16
system of of eating called bright line
10:18
eating where I don't eat any flour or
10:20
sugar and I only eat three times a day
10:23
no snacking so if I followed my bright
10:26
lines then I get to mark it off
10:28
professional development is over here
10:30
which for me is like courses that I'm
10:33
taking books that I'm reading on
10:35
business or how to write that sort of
10:37
thing and blog work because I've been
10:40
working to launch my heart breathing's
10:41
website and this is actually launch week
10:44
so if you're watching I really
10:45
appreciate it and thank you for the
10:47
support hopefully you'll get a lot out
10:49
of these videos and if there's anything
10:51
that you'd like to see covered about my
10:53
planner or how to self-publish please go
10:55
ahead and comment below let me know what
10:58
it is you'd like to hear more about like
11:00
if you like the planning videos I'm just
11:02
kind of getting a feel for what people
11:04
are going to want to see so feel free to
11:06
comment and let me know like if you want
11:07
to see more of this if you want to see
11:09
like color coding or planning plotting
11:11
ideas I'll be happy to cover it so if I
11:14
worked on my blog that day I get to mark
11:16
it off and as you can see for January I
11:20
had like editing days outlining
11:22
outlining and then I wrote 14,000 words
11:24
this day so in the blue highlighted
11:27
space because I counted up all the
11:29
original words I wrote that week I got
11:31
to write 14,000 761 then I keep my word
11:35
track word count tracked for the week
11:37
and then in the blue space I add up the
11:39
total for that week down here at the
11:42
bottom I also wanted to just do a couple
11:46
of little things kind of as a memory
11:48
keeper I guess you could say so this is
11:50
more like beyond the darkness released
11:52
this month and I also had planned on
11:54
doing heart breathing's launched last
11:56
month but since I got behind on my book
11:57
if that didn't happen so I moved it over
11:59
here I also turned 41 cuz it's my
12:02
birthday in January so I just kind of
12:03
I'm gonna fill these in with like little
12:07
things I want to remember but anyway so
12:09
these are the way that I'm planning to
12:11
use this index page which is kind of
12:13
like a yearly overview I'm gonna track
12:15
my word count and have a monthly habit
12:18
tracker to see what I've gotten done for
12:20
the month and then kind of celebrate the
12:21
milestones and wins so that's the index
12:25
then this is just your typical monthly
12:28
calendar and I feel like I haven't
12:29
totally used the monthly calendar very
12:32
much so I may kind of play around with
12:34
how I want to use this better but I
12:36
actually haven't been back to reference
12:38
this page very often so I'm not sure if
12:40
I can try to find a way to use it a
12:41
little bit better
12:42
okay so then it has also a weekly view
12:46
and for a while when I first started
12:49
using it I was trying to you can see
12:51
like it's changed drastically from week
12:53
to week how much I used it but I found
12:56
that I was trying to be so specific on
12:59
how to use it according to the hours
13:01
because it has the hours here from 5:00
13:03
a.m. until midnight and I just was
13:07
trying to figure out how best to use it
13:09
but it was just not something I was
13:11
utilizing until I went on Pinterest and
13:13
saw some ways that other people are
13:15
using it it was like
13:16
oh yes this is totally how I want to do
13:18
it so I actually I have a cricket which
13:20
is if you're not familiar with that it's
13:22
like a crafting tool that cuts out vinyl
13:25
and it can cut out stickers so I went on
13:27
Etsy I bought some Ikon stickers in
13:30
different colors and then I made my
13:32
icons and then I made my own stickers
13:34
from those icons so like the little pig
13:36
the email a notebook meal planning
13:40
little tags almost all of these stickers
13:42
I made myself because these are the ones
13:44
I knew I would use like a pencil for
13:46
when I'm writing a little notebook for
13:49
when I'm outlining a envelope for when
13:52
I'm sending out an email or checking my
13:53
email I've got a little camera here I'm
13:55
not sure you can see that super well so
13:58
I'll bring it up maybe a little bit but
13:59
it's got a little camera here for like
14:01
when I'm taking my photos for Instagram
14:03
a laptop for when I'm working on my
14:06
website for I'm working on heart
14:08
breathing's so I found that this
14:10
actually I've been doing this for the
14:12
last couple weeks and it's really
14:13
working for me because those icons are a
14:16
good kind of draws my eye and got okay
14:19
I'm writing here I'm doing this at this
14:21
time you can also see it's like I've
14:23
covered every inch of the space and I've
14:25
just found that I like being able to
14:26
leave myself notes rather than
14:28
necessarily following every single hour
14:30
I'm leaving myself notes on like okay
14:33
Andrew time we should go to the beach of
14:34
the weather is nice play at home if it's
14:37
too cold so I write out more than just
14:39
saying Andrew on a list you know Andrews
14:41
my son so it's it's kind of turned into
14:45
like a giant to-do list a journal and my
14:48
top goals and stuff all in one place
14:51
then I'm putting these weather icons up
14:53
at the top so these are the last couple
14:55
of weeks this is this week obviously
14:58
it's Valentine's when I'm recording this
15:01
so I've got hearts and red and pink all
15:05
over the page but I've got my basic
15:07
schedule in here as well like I've got a
15:09
mom visit at Andrews school I've got a
15:12
meeting on Thursday I had a meeting
15:14
today at 1:00
15:15
so I've got my meetings and stuff and I
15:17
try to keep them popping out with these
15:20
different stickers but I also have my
15:22
to-do list like I want to record a video
15:24
this day I've got my meal plan written
15:26
on here
15:27
I've got like I'm gonna upload my intro
15:30
video on Sunday I've got writing times
15:32
and stuff like that so it's it's a mix
15:34
of my to-do list and my actual like
15:38
journaling and time like scheduled
15:41
things so now we move on to the daily
15:46
pages and you know when you really start
15:49
looking at the daily like I use them a
15:51
lot for word count like Sprint's that I
15:54
run like 15 20 minutes prints they'll be
15:57
all marked in here also at the beginning
15:59
of the month they have this page that's
16:01
like remember this and it's kind of I
16:04
think can be like a to-do list or memory
16:06
keeping thing for the month however you
16:07
wanted to use it well every 90 days I
16:10
have three main goals and I have every
16:13
30 days sort of milestones that I want
16:16
to hit for that that 30-day is to hit my
16:20
90-day goal so I don't know if that
16:21
makes sense or but I'm talking in
16:23
circles there but I write out at the
16:25
beginning of each month for goal number
16:27
one here's the milestones I need to hit
16:29
for goal number two here's the things I
16:31
need to get done so these are like my
16:32
high level goals and projects that I
16:34
need to be working on and I can flip
16:36
back and reference this at any time when
16:39
I'm trying to plan for my week and what
16:42
I found this also really helping me is
16:44
at the beginning of the week so this is
16:46
Sunday every Sunday I sit down to plan
16:49
and I write out my week ahead and then I
16:52
write out the main things that need to
16:53
get done in each category so heart
16:56
breathing's is my blog and I have a
16:57
little list of things that I want to get
16:59
done sacrifice me as my work in progress
17:01
so I write down what I want to get done
17:03
my marketing plan paperbacks and then I
17:06
write down the meetings that I have for
17:08
the month or for the week down here at
17:10
the bottom so I don't forget them this
17:12
is what I do first then I go back and I
17:15
plan that weekly page because I want to
17:17
make sure I know all of my tasks and
17:19
goals that I want to accomplish then I
17:21
go back and fill in my weekly then every
17:25
day I sit down and I actually I do it
17:31
like the night before so it is currently
17:33
Monday the 12th that I'm recording this
17:35
and the 13th tomorrow
17:38
I will what I'll do tonight when I
17:39
finish recording this is Olga
17:41
sit down at the couch probably watch
17:42
some Olympics and I will fill out my
17:45
goals for tomorrow I find it so much
17:47
more productive to fill out my goals the
17:50
night before rather than getting up in
17:51
the morning because then I tend to like
17:53
drag my feet I don't really want to do
17:56
this I don't want to work on that
17:57
project whatever so I always do it the
17:59
night before and what I do is I mark out
18:01
kind of my like to do's and then I write
18:03
out my priorities and this is where I
18:05
use those if you can see those icons
18:08
they're like the yoga icon a book the
18:10
face book the monitor the video
18:13
recording this is where I use that now
18:15
right my schedule down here on the left
18:17
side where I can say okay I'm going to
18:20
do writing from this time I've got a
18:21
meeting here so this is the schedule
18:23
part then I get this is kind of where it
18:26
becomes more like a bullet journal in a
18:27
way and you could make this as artistic
18:29
as you want or as simple as you want I
18:31
tend to keep mine pretty simple I really
18:34
like this set up and so I write out like
18:36
here's my priorities for heart
18:38
breathing's I'm gonna record this video
18:39
for example or like I've got a record
18:41
how I use my hobo Nietzsche as a writer
18:44
and when I finish that I can check it
18:45
off marketing plan and so on I also
18:49
wanted to just mention that I bought
18:52
some tabs off of Amazon because these
18:53
are not actually tabbed they do have
18:56
like a color block here so that when you
18:58
look on the side you can kind of see it
19:00
but what I did to make it stand out more
19:02
as I put a strip of washi on the first
19:04
day of every month so that when you look
19:06
at it you can tell what are the months
19:08
and then I also bought these tabs on
19:10
Amazon that stick on so I can be like oh
19:14
there's February March and I can
19:15
reference them very quickly
19:17
unfortunately the ones that I put on the
19:21
washi tape or sticking really well but I
19:23
had some here to mark the like months
19:26
and stuff and those just keep coming off
19:28
so I'm gonna just throw that out and
19:30
maybe I'll put some washi strips and
19:34
redo those but that is basically how I
19:37
am using my hobo Nietzsche to help
19:40
manage my writing tasks and to help
19:43
balance writing and family
19:46
and business and I really hope that this
19:49
helps and again if you would if you

[Music]

hey everybody I am bringing you a new
0:02
video today where I'm gonna show you how
0:04
I take old dated planners and turn them
0:07
into my plotting notebooks this has been
0:14
something that's been really fun for me
0:15
because I had a couple of old planners
0:18
that I had paid for and never used
0:21
because I by way too many planners every
0:23
year and sometimes things work out and
0:25
sometimes they don't or I had a few
0:27
planners that I only have used so out of
0:29
necessity I started thinking how can I
0:32
use these instead of just throwing them
0:34
away because they have dates on them for
0:36
previous years so it doesn't really fit
0:38
you know that you can use them moving
0:40
forward unless you read ated the entire
0:42
calendar so I started thinking about how
0:44
I could use these for plotting notebooks
0:47
I'm going to show you that today I have
0:48
both an Erin Condren hardbound planner
0:51
that is a 2017 2018 18 month planner and
0:56
I actually have really wanted to try the
0:58
Erin Condren you know most of the time
1:02
they're coil bound but they released a
1:04
hard bound and I was really interested
1:05
in them but they were like $30 so I
1:09
waited until my local staples had the
1:12
2017-2018 dated planners on sale for
1:16
only $10 and I snagged one so that I
1:18
could practice this plotting method
1:19
inside here so I'll show you that at the
1:21
end but the main notebook that I use on
1:24
a regular basis is this happy planner
1:27
it's in a deluxe this is the big happy
1:29
planner not the classic but you could
1:31
probably use a classic as well and that
1:35
the big happy planner is more like a
1:37
regular sized notebook eight-and-a-half
1:39
by eleven and then I've got the deluxe
1:41
cover that has the happy planner inside
1:44
and I also have a happy planner hole
1:48
punch that will punch the holes for this
1:51
and it will also do a big or a classic
1:55
and you can get these like at Michael's
1:56
probably at Amazon lots of different
1:59
places if you're not familiar with what
2:01
a happy planner is is a disc bounce
2:04
system so you have these disks these
2:06
they're plastic and metal discs that you
2:09
get and then the pages inside
2:12
have these little notches when you punch
2:14
them if you can see that where they just
2:17
clip on so instead of a binder that you
2:20
have to actually pull apart the binder
2:22
this just you can just stick the pages
2:25
straight inside so I enjoy using this
2:28
instead of other types of planners
2:30
because you can really create your own
2:32
notebooks out of these old planners and
2:34
just use the data at pages however you
2:36
want so inside my deluxe cover I have a
2:40
pin pouch a few stickers usually I'll
2:43
have one of these happy planner sticker
2:45
books just placed into one of the
2:50
pockets so that I can carry that with me
2:52
and then I'll have various stickers I'll
2:54
show you how I use these in a little bit
2:56
so I'm going to set those to the side as
2:57
well and when I get ready to plot I
3:00
usually pull this planning pouch this
3:04
little pouch out because it tends to get
3:07
in the way when you open it it gets a
3:09
little bumpy inside this pouch I will
3:13
usually have some like tombow removable
3:16
adhesive that you can put on and I'll
3:18
show you how I use all these things in a
3:20
little bit then I have coordinating
3:22
washi tapes that I want to use and then
3:26
some pins that I can use while I'm
3:30
planning most of my pins I used for
3:32
color coding so I've got these SEPA pins
3:34
that I really like because you can get
3:36
them in different colors and I'm just a
3:38
sucker for felt-tip pens and you can see
3:41
how these particular felt-tip pens have
3:43
really nice long tips to them and
3:44
they're very inexpensive these are
3:47
probably my favorite wants to use so
3:50
actually I'm gonna use actually I'm
3:53
going to use these Sharpie pens because
3:55
it has a pink I don't know where I put
3:57
my pink of the CEPA marker so set those
4:00
to the side but I keep you know based
4:02
these basic tools and usually I have a
4:04
set of scissors in here as well now this
4:07
is actually quite heavy so I don't carry
4:09
it out with me like if I'm going writing
4:11
to Starbucks what I'll use instead is a
4:14
portable plot notes booklet and I
4:16
actually made a video on how I make
4:18
those plot note booklets so I will link
4:20
that down below for you as well
4:22
so what I did was I found this big happy
4:25
planner on clearance long after this
4:28
wasn't another 18 month planner I
4:30
believe or it could have been a planner
4:32
from last year and I found it on
4:34
clearance like toward the end of the
4:36
year for only like $7 so this was really
4:38
really inexpensive and I took the tabs
4:43
and just put my book title on the tabs I
4:47
could probably could have done a
4:48
prettier job but I just did a basic job
4:50
so that the dividers now have my
4:53
different book covers and I don't want
4:55
to show you like my actual plotting
4:57
notes because you know I have fans that
4:58
watch this channel and I don't want them
5:00
to see the notes that I have made so
5:03
what I'm going to do is just make
5:04
something for a future book and I'm not
5:07
going to fill it out with my own plot
5:09
notes I'll just show you how I do it so
5:10
on the back of the tab or the divider
5:13
there is the month like this was from
5:17
April so instead of using the month I
5:21
have these have various types of
5:23
printables but this is just my own paper
5:26
that I made blind paper for and I'm
5:30
going to take this lined paper I'm going
5:32
to stick it in here and then I'm going
5:35
to attach it with my adhesive and that
5:39
way I can use this page to cover this
5:41
one
5:45
[Music]
5:50
okay so now instead of seeing the dated
5:54
page that has gone by now I've got just
5:59
a note page so on this page I usually
6:02
will write things like by character
6:04
names or any kind of story threads that
6:05
I want to carry through or just any kind
6:07
of notes then what I also have here is I
6:11
print it out I got this from a seller on
6:13
Etsy I'm not sure if that's going to
6:15
show up here or not but this is just a
6:18
really light pink dot grid and I can
6:21
print it out eight-and-a-half by eleven
6:22
so this is perfect and I use an HP paper
6:25
that I will link down below to that it's
6:27
nice and thick and it doesn't bleed
6:29
through so I grabbed two of those sheets
6:32
I always kind of have a pile of them
6:33
ready to go because I also want to cover
6:36
the other side of my dated sheets so
6:39
this is just to I have like a stack of
6:41
my dated sheets from old planners just
6:43
sitting you know down in and old this
6:46
actually may be something part of 2018
6:49
but I have them sitting in a drawer down
6:52
here and I just pulled out two random
6:53
pages they don't even have to really
6:55
match but I kind of like the flowers on
6:57
this so what I will do is I'm going to
6:59
take these first two pages and I'm going
7:02
to stick them in to the planner and then
7:05
I'm just going to repeat that process to
7:07
cover up the other side
7:11
[Music]
7:30
okay so now what I have so far is I have
7:33
the divider with a note page on the back
7:36
I have my pink grid which is now
7:38
attached to my planning page then I also
7:43
have the backside is covered so I can
7:46
use all of these four notes now instead
7:48
of having that opposite side of the
7:51
planner page I can use those four notes
7:53
then the only other things that I
7:54
usually will put in here are I have
7:57
these character plotting pages that I
7:59
have made myself from james-scott Bell
8:02
superstructure I've actually also been
8:05
using another one another plotting
8:07
method that I have some other sheets for
8:09
but for now this will work because I
8:11
already had them printed out I will grab
8:12
one set of these sheets for each
8:15
character in my book so this is a
8:17
romance so there are two characters male
8:19
and female so I grabbed two sets of
8:21
sheets so this has all of you know the
8:23
points basic plot points of act 1 act 2
8:26
and act 3 and then on this other sheet I
8:29
have the goal motivation conflict for
8:31
each character there external internal
8:33
and then I have their character arc
8:36
triangle where they are in the beginning
8:37
of the story the middle or mirror moment
8:39
of the story and where they are at the
8:41
end so these two sheets are really kind
8:44
of where I start my plotting and I like
8:47
to have them you know print it out and I
8:49
keep them for each book and each point
8:52
of view character so that I can really
8:53
start overall brainstorming this doesn't
8:56
give me every single scene of the book
8:59
but it tells me enough about what the
9:01
characters want what their goals are
9:02
what they need to discover throughout
9:04
the story tells me enough about where
9:06
they are at the beginning and where
9:07
they're going in terms of the character
9:09
arc and it gives me these main plot
9:11
points like the doorway of no-return
9:12
number one that gives me that first kind
9:15
of twists or that first moment of no
9:17
return then you know the mirror moment
9:19
gives me that midpoint like where
9:22
where's this character going it gives me
9:24
that midpoint twist doorway of no return
9:26
number two is what leads us into Act
9:28
three the lights out or black moment
9:30
here the final battle transformation it
9:33
just gives me that overarching view of
9:36
how the plot of this story is going to
9:38
go and I usually will also and you can
9:41
see this in some of my other things I
9:43
usually will also have a lot of just
9:47
brainstorming pages so I'll just print
9:49
out just basic notebook paper basically
9:54
I have them in different colors because
9:55
I pretty much I'm a crazy color coding
9:57
fiend but I will also add those sheets
10:01
so that I can keep all my plot notes in
10:03
here at once but the main thing is how
10:06
do we use these dated pages so I'm going
10:08
to go ahead and show you what I do with
10:10
this so the first thing we need to do is
10:13
cover up the places where there are
10:15
dates listed so up here at the top what
10:18
I would normally do is I'm going to just
10:20
pick out a washi that color codes or
10:22
color coordinates with anything that
10:24
might happen to be on the planner pages
10:26
a lot of the happy planner pages will
10:28
have something already done so I'm going
10:30
to go ahead and cover this up now you
10:32
could use something this is kind of
10:33
see-through you could use something
10:35
completely opaque if you wanted to but
10:38
I'm going to just use this and I'll show
10:40
you what I do as I go
10:42
[Music]
11:16
[Music]
11:20
okay so what I've done so far is just
11:23
use some basic washi tape to cover up
11:25
the dates here and I've also separated
11:29
this final box if you see how this happy
11:31
planner also the Erin Condren is the
11:33
same way that they have these three
11:35
boxes so I'm going to use that in my
11:37
plotting but I'm going to separate the
11:39
bottom box then what I'm going to do is
11:41
I take these round Avery labels and I
11:46
cover up the rest of the date
11:56
[Music]
12:08
okay now that I have my labels in place
12:11
what I will do is I'm going to use each
12:15
of these section of blocks for a
12:18
different part of the plot now this is
12:21
where you can totally customize it
12:23
depending on what plotting method you
12:25
use for me I use the three-act structure
12:28
but in my mind act one is you know
12:33
relatively short then you've got act two
12:36
is almost like two x in and of itself so
12:38
I separate that then you've got act
12:40
three here at the end which doesn't for
12:42
me take necessarily a lot of listing out
12:44
scenes because it's not as much build-up
12:48
it's usually just okay this is the final
12:50
battle so it doesn't need as much space
12:52
so you'll see what I do here is I'm
12:54
going to label these so that act 1 is
12:56
both of these first sections so this
12:58
will be act 1 Part A and act 1 Part B
13:06
okay so then I hope I can explain this
13:09
without it being too confusing but then
13:11
act 2 actually takes up twice as much
13:13
space and I separate it here with the
13:16
midpoint or mirror moment being right
13:18
here so I'm going to use two columns for
13:21
Act one two columns for Act two part one
13:24
and two columns for Act two part two so
13:27
the way I label them is I will say Act
13:29
two and then I'll put one a so this is
13:34
like part one a then Act two and this
13:41
will be one B
13:50
so I've got act to one a act to one B so
13:55
this is the first half of Act two
13:57
separated by the midpoint down here then
14:00
this is the second half of Act two so
14:02
I've got 2a and 2b then this final
14:05
column is going to be all I need of Act
14:08
three so I will just put Act three and
14:10
then I'll have my a and act three down
14:14
here with my B because there are seven
14:19
days in the week for this weekly spread
14:21
this was just the best way that I could
14:23
think of to separate these where it
14:25
would make sense and have room for all
14:27
the plotting notes that I need so in
14:29
terms of plot for me this would be the
14:31
first half of Act one and there's
14:33
usually going to be some kind of little
14:35
twist here at the end of this first
14:37
section then at the end of Act one
14:41
you've got the doorway of no return
14:43
which would be right here
14:44
then I've got Act two first half with
14:48
the midpoint or the mirror moment here
14:49
which is that kind of game-changing
14:51
moment then an act to this is kind of
14:53
like the reaction to everything the the
14:56
reaction to the midpoint and that
14:58
game-changer and coming up with that
14:59
final plan and everything that's leading
15:02
you toward that ultimate final battle so
15:04
this little section here will be
15:06
whatever that second doorway is and then
15:09
Act three this is all of your like
15:11
storming the castle final battles type
15:13
movements and then this little section
15:15
down here is what I have for after the
15:17
black moment and the final conflict this
15:20
is the resolution so I just usually need
15:22
to write oh they they go home and you
15:25
know they all make up or they've
15:27
declared their love and now this is
15:28
their like little epilogue so it doesn't
15:30
really need as much space as the actual
15:32
scenes or rising action of Act two and
15:35
hopefully that makes sense of course you
15:37
could take this and you could separate
15:38
it however you wanted to do now down
15:42
here below where I've separated these
15:44
boxes at the bottom this is where I will
15:47
write notes and I will keep scene notes
15:51
down here that correspond to the boxes
15:54
that go above it so if I'm talking about
15:55
like the intro of the characters or the
15:59
introduction of this story or the
16:01
beginning of the world building I might
16:02
leave some notes down here about
16:04
something I want to remember this if
16:06
this is like it the next book in a
16:07
series it might be something that you
16:10
know that I need to touch on here in the
16:11
first act that I don't want to forget
16:13
about or if it's a brand-new book like
16:15
this witches mark is the next book in my
16:18
triton or my Willow Harbor series so
16:21
this is a standalone romance so here I
16:23
might leave some more notes about you
16:25
know how the characters look or what
16:27
type of situation or conflict they're
16:29
coming from I might just make some notes
16:32
about what I want to remember about
16:34
those characters it just sort of depends
16:36
on what fits the story what kind of
16:37
notes need to go down here now also I
16:40
want to cover up over here this place
16:43
where it says February because I don't
16:45
need that so what I usually do is I'll
16:48
go into one of these me and my big ideas
16:51
books and I will find something that I
16:57
can cover it with
17:01
so for example that covers it quite
17:03
nicely then you could also use just some
17:07
washi tape if you wanted to cover it
17:08
with washi tape I don't see anything
17:10
just jumping out at me from that sticker
17:13
book so what I'm going to do instead is
17:14
I'm just going to put this here in the
17:18
middle and I will just write my title on
17:21
there
17:27
really--it's anything you could use to
17:29
cover that up and make it pretty you
17:31
know I could maybe put the pink or
17:33
something there to make it nicer then
17:35
down below on this side column is
17:37
usually where I'll put notes about like
17:39
my POV characters so I'll just list the
17:44
main characters any other kind of story
17:46
threads I want to carry through
17:48
I'll also usually put my word count goal
17:50
so for example in this book my word
17:53
count goal is fifty thousand words then
18:02
what I will do is just as a little note
18:06
underneath here I will put what what
18:10
milestone I want to hit in terms of
18:13
those word count goals by the time I get
18:15
to that particular word count so for
18:19
this particular book all I do is I
18:22
usually separate it by four so for
18:25
example this is a 50,000 word book so I
18:27
know that by the mid point I want to be
18:30
at about 25 thousand words so I'll just
18:34
set that right underneath here and then
18:37
I just continue to go from there so I'm
18:40
going to put 50,000 down here at the end
18:42
which is where I want to be by the time
18:44
I finish the story but that would also
18:47
mean I want to be here by the end of Act
18:50
two I would want to be at 37,500 here
18:55
and then where a hit the doorway first
18:58
doorway of no return I would want to be
19:00
at 12,500 that just sort of gives me a
19:04
roadmap so that as I'm writing I can be
19:07
like okay I've way overestimated this
19:09
the books going to be much longer these
19:11
are just kind of guidelines that I
19:13
follow and I like to write those
19:14
underneath the main turning points at
19:16
the end of each act so that I can stay
19:18
on track then usually what I'll do is
19:21
just keep any other little notes down
19:23
here so that is basically how I do my
19:26
plotting I will also usually like I said
19:28
use some sort of color coding system
19:30
sometimes I will use dots like these
19:33
dots that I got off of Amazon and I will
19:36
you know put a pink dot for one you know
19:39
like my pink
19:40
dot would be for my female character and
19:42
I might use a blue dot for my male
19:44
character sometimes I will use those
19:47
stickers and each dot will equal you
19:49
know the different scenes I'll just
19:50
write out the different scenes that you
19:52
find in this particular book now since
19:55
I've got about 12,000 words per act for
19:59
me that means there's going to be about
20:00
six six or seven major scenes that
20:04
happen in this first act so it would
20:06
usually be you know somewhere around two
20:09
in each box and what I would usually do
20:12
is I would use a pink pen to make a dot
20:16
and you know write in what that
20:20
character is doing so it might be like
20:21
if the opening scene is so my female
20:25
character in this book is named Ana so
20:28
in this I might put just a little pink
20:30
dot here and I would write out something
20:32
about like Ana shows up at the coffee
20:35
shop and meets this other mysterious guy
20:39
so I might just write a little bit a
20:40
note about that again it gets difficult
20:44
to kind of show exactly that process
20:45
without giving away what some of the
20:47
plots of my books are so this is about
20:49
as far as I can go with it for now but
20:52
hopefully you get an idea a good idea of
20:54
what I'm doing in these plot notebooks
20:56
now another idea that I have seen people
21:00
use before with some of these is to use
21:03
your old planner you could use them as a
21:06
way to track your character's movements
21:10
so for example you know if you're using
21:12
a calendar here it wouldn't really
21:13
matter if it's July or not you just use
21:15
the Sunday Monday Tuesday Wednesday so
21:18
that you could jot down something here
21:19
to follow your characters timeline so
21:21
you might be like okay Harper went to
21:23
school on Monday and this is what
21:25
happened to her and then I specifically
21:27
say two days later this happened so then
21:29
I would write just a little note about
21:31
what happened on Wednesday then it would
21:33
be like the next day okay so I know
21:36
that's Thursday and it would keep help
21:37
you keep track of what's going on with
21:39
your characters timelines and the dates
21:41
don't really matter it's just more the
21:42
days of the week so that you don't
21:44
accidentally say it's Friday and she was
21:46
getting out of school and then the next
21:48
day she's back in school again because
21:49
readers will be very confused so you can
21:52
keep up with your time
21:54
through this I also just went ahead and
21:56
started looking at the Erin Condren to
21:59
see if I could do it basically the same
22:01
way since these have the same three
22:03
boxes it's very simple to organize it
22:07
the same way that I did the happy
22:08
planner is just as you can see the boxes
22:10
are much smaller so you would have to
22:11
write much smaller
22:12
you also can't put new pages into this
22:16
unless you were to like glue them on or
22:18
stick them on in some way because
22:19
there's no coil there's no obviously
22:22
discs but the cool thing about this
22:24
would be that you could keep an entire
22:26
series of plot notes you know together
22:28
in this type of booklet and all you
22:31
would do is the same basic thing you
22:33
would cover up the dates at the top and
22:36
then separate this bottom box or you
22:39
could use that bottom box however you
22:40
want there's also these lined boxes or
22:44
sections down here at the bottom which
22:46
might be kind of cool for writing out
22:48
the goal motivation and conflict for
22:50
each of your characters but you kind of
22:52
get the idea this would be the basically
22:54
the same type like to see how I did that
22:56
down here with the goal motivation
22:58
conflict I was just kind of playing
23:00
around with what I could do but you
23:02
could easily use this type of planner
23:03
for the same sort of plotting thing and
23:05
this would be just kind of a pretty
23:07
place to you know organize and
23:09
brainstorm your plotting notebooks but
23:11
the reason that I like the happy planner
23:14
system is because of the disk bound you
23:16
can take pages in and out so you can use
23:18
some of those old planner pages you can
23:20
use the disks and everything else but it
23:22
becomes more like a notebook that you
23:24
can add your own plotting pages into and
23:28
your own notes pages into which I really
23:30
really like and that is all I have for
23:33
you today I hope this has been something
23:36
fun and interesting for you to see how I
23:37
use my old happy planner to plot my
23:40
books I will also be having hopefully a
23:43
planner style videos on Saturdays every
23:46
time so next week I'm going to talk
23:48
about how I use a color coding system in
23:50
my plotting notes and how I use
23:52
different color codes for different
23:54
multiple POVs so if there's any other
23:57
type of planning or organizational style
23:59
video you'd like to see just let me know
24:01
during the main weeks Monday Wednesday
24:03
Friday I'm going to be talking about
24:04
like marketing and how I built my main
24:07
series over the next few weeks so I hope
24:09
that you will subscribe to this channel
24:11
give this video a thumbs up and comment
24:14

hey guys welcome back to heart briefings raise your hand if you are somebody who
0:05
is always feeling a little bit overwhelmed always pushing yourself right up to the last minute of that
0:12
deadline feeling like there are so many things you really want to be doing that you just don't have time for or
0:18
constantly stressed that you're not doing enough or you're not good enough I
0:24
know there are a lot of you out there who probably raised her hand or not it and said yes that feels like me and I
0:31
know that for me I was like that for a long time too and there are still pieces of my life that are in that old pattern
0:39
despite how many times I plan or try to change my behavior I do often end up
0:46
taking on more than I can handle because I'm multi passionate I know a lot of you
0:52
are too there are so many things I care about so many things I want to be doing and there's just never enough time so
0:58
even though I have my HB 90 plan in place I have my Kanban board I know exactly what I'm taking on there is
1:05
still often a feeling of I've overestimated how much I can get done
1:11
things are taking longer than I anticipated or I'm caught up doing some
1:16
types of work that I wish I had help with or that I wish I could do faster and I have better systems for and I just
1:23
wish that I was further ahead because I feel like if I could get more ahead in
1:30
all of my work then I would get a little bit of breathing room take a little bit of that stress off my shoulders and have
1:36
more joy in my life more time for family and then more time potentially for some of those projects that I keep having to
1:43
push back because I just don't have time for them so if this is something that sounds interesting to you definitely

2:10

2:20
an absolutely gorgeous day here in Charleston South Carolina and I've got the windows open I have been sitting
2:27
outside a little bit today and just enjoying it and really spending some time thinking about my ideal life now
2:34
there's a couple things I want to say one is that there is no sparkly destination no ideal life that when you
2:41
arrive at that place suddenly all your stress is gone and your happy and everything is perfect in your life that
2:48
destination doesn't exist because even if you get the house and the career and the husband and the family and
2:53
everything else that you've always wanted you're gonna be sitting there wanting even more because that's how
2:59
humans work and I know from experience that it's dangerous thinking I can push
3:04
myself to the limit as hard as I possibly can because once I hit this level XYZ this
3:10
house or get this next big thing or hit this level of income then everything is
3:15
going to get easier and that is also a lie so if you have been operating in your career like I used to where you
3:22
always say to yourself okay I can push myself really hard this year I can write those twelve books I can you know push
3:29
myself to the limit I can stay up all night I can do these really hard things because as soon as they're done and I
3:35
have this income this many books this type of life then I can relax then I'll
3:41
have made it and everything will get easier I used to be that person I used to think if I could just be making you
3:47
know twenty thousand dollars a month and we can just have this nicer house and I could just have my son because I really
3:53
really want to have a baby if I could have these things and I had this laundry list of an ideal life that I had set out for myself and I pushed
4:00
myself to the limit to the max pretty much all the time so I always felt overwhelmed and I always felt way behind
4:06
and then woke up one day and realized oh my gosh I have all of those things I
4:12
have the house the husband the income and it's still not making me happy because I'm still way behind I'm never
4:19
doing enough it's never enough so when I hit that point in my life where I realized I had
4:24
these things I had wanted for so long and they just weren't bringing me joy I had to change the way I was doing things
4:30
and this is when I started to develop a system that I call the HP 90 system it's a 90 day system where you have three
4:37
main goals and you choose the goals according to what type of life you would
4:44
like to have not believing that this ideal life is truly a destination that suddenly everything's going to be happy
4:50
but instead using that picture of your ideal life as a GPS system so that you
4:56
can say do I want to take on this project yes or no do I want to be this person do I want to show up in this way
5:02
do I want to write this genre and every question that you have to answer as a person as an entrepreneur as a creator
5:08
has an easier path to an answer because you know where you're headed so it's a
5:14
GPS not actually a destination it's a guide for your journey then the next
5:19
part of the system is breaking those big bowls down into smaller tasks and
5:25
projects that can be completed over the course of 90 days and this is where the magic starts to come in because you have
5:32
to look at how much time you realistically have to spend on that and then break it down and be realistic
5:37
however this is still where I'm messing up in my own system in my own plan
5:43
because inevitably things take me longer than I expected them to so if I say I'm
5:49
gonna create this video today this is I'm already on the third time that I've recorded it so if I said it was going to
5:54
take me two hours to record it now it's going to take me three or four hours and this happens over and over again and
6:01
even though I know it's happening I still have a difficult time properly estimating and being realistic about how
6:08
much time something is going to take I put too much of my I wish it would only take this amount of time and not enough
6:15
realistic it is going to take me this amount of time because it always takes me this amount of time so we're going to
6:22
talk about that it might get ahead plan because that's one of the main things that trips me up another thing that
6:27
trips me up is being extremely multi passionate I know that so many of you
6:33
out there are like this too we want to be writing multiple genres we to have our family we want to work out
6:39
we want to spend time at the beach and have our game time and playtime but we also kind of want to do this nonfiction
6:46
book and we sort of want to make stickers for Etsy and we want to do this planning and we want to and the list
6:51
just goes on and on and these are all things that we're passionate about that we really want to do and that do
6:56
actually factor into what we want to be doing in our ideal life that GPS system
7:01
but oh my gosh there's just never enough time like I would love to be watching
7:07
you know Skillshare videos and learning how to take better pictures and you know I could list a thousand things I wish I
7:13
had time for and that feeling of one thing to do more and feeling like I'm
7:19
never getting to do everything tends to lead to a feeling of never enough always
7:25
rush always behind so the idea of actually getting ahead has been on my
7:32
mind for a while and in my HP 90 planner I have this one page that's called the
7:37
future ideas parking lot and getting ahead in my writing and my planners and
7:43
a lot of other business things that I have like videos has been on that future idea parking lot for several quarters so
7:50
this quarter which is q2 of 2020 as I'm recording this is the quarter where I
7:56
decided I was going to outline my plan even though I didn't have time I knew to execute it so there was so much interest
8:03
when I mentioned this on my Instagram stories that I thought why don't I take
8:08
you guys along for the journey so I am going to show you today what I'm setting up how I'm outlining and organizing my
8:15
plan to get ahead then in the next couple of weeks as I begin planning for q3 of 2020 which is July August and
8:22
September I will show you the actual checklist that I've made and the things that I intend to do in q3 to get ahead
8:30
now I anticipate this amount of work that it's going to take me to get ahead and this amount of focus is probably
8:37
going to be multiple quarters worth of work so you'll see when I start to replan for q3 that my get ahead goal is
8:45
going to be one of my three goals for the quarter and it will probably be multiple quarters at least two maybe an
8:51
entire year worth of projects that will go into this so we're gonna take it tiny
8:57
step by tiny step but my hope in doing this is to get a little bit ahead so
9:03
that I don't constantly feel like Here I am on Wednesday afternoon recording a video that I have to edit and get ready to
9:10
post by Thursday or it gets a little bit behind and it doesn't get up until Friday because even though I'm doing the
9:16
work and I'm showing up and I'm so excited and I'm getting so much more done than I got done five years ago or
9:22
could have dreamed of doing five years ago I still am not quite where I want to
9:27
be which honestly is a great place to be as a human being because if we were perfect life would be boring so it's
9:34
always about baby steps to that life that we want to getting better and better so for me this is the next step
9:41
is getting ahead how much easier would my life be if I was a few months ahead
9:46
and I had plenty of time to plan out those edits and plan out those
9:52
promotions and launches and things like that everything is going really well
9:57
even though I push things to the edge but I know that there's a toll that gets taken on me in terms of my stress and it
10:05
takes a toll on my family as well particularly my husband because he has to take over if I have a 15 hour editing
10:12
day he's got the kids for 15 hours and I yeah sometimes I'm sitting here holding the baby on my lap and I want to spend
10:18
as much time with her as possible but it also might mean a couple days where we're ordering out not the healthiest
10:25
foods and we're all just a little bit extra stressed and not getting enough sleep so I want to eliminate that stuff
10:30
in my life so let me take you along for the first part of this journey which was
10:36
setting up this notebook and the types of things I plan to do to get ahead okay so now that I've told you why this
10:42
project is so important to me let me show you what I'm going to do so this will be the how and the what I'm using
10:49
so just quickly I'm going to go over my supplies here I have a bunch of notebooks and of course any new project
10:55
is a great excuse to pull out a new notebook I get a lot of my inspiration for starting a new project if I can use
11:03
new fun things that inspire me I know that sounds silly but I know also that a lot of you understand that so I went
11:09
through all my notebooks and finally chose this one from Erin Condren I put this cover on it
11:15
they have interchangeable covers so you can switch them out and this one that says she designed a life she loved felt
11:21
like the perfect one for this particular project I also decided to use their productivity notebook spread so they
11:28
have notebooks that have dot grid or just lined but this one also has a little Productivity checklist on the
11:35
side and I think that that's going to work really well and I'll show you why in a moment I also took one of their zippered
11:42
pouches and put it on a coil clip connector so that you can put it into the coil and just cut up a bunch of
11:49
stickers that I can use I think that I'm also going to add these stickers to that
11:57
box or I think I'm also going to add these neutral stickers as well I know I'm gonna use a lot of these page flags
12:03
they're notebooks actually come with a lot of page flags but I have a feeling I'm gonna go through a ton during this
12:10
project so yeah there's going to be a lot of that so I wanted to have them all in one place so I don't have to go
12:17
searching for stickers every single time but I did have to cut them down to fit
12:22
into the actual zippered pouch so I'll need to cut these as well I grabbed a few other things that I
12:28
think I will use during this project so one is just correction tape you know just typical things in case I need to
12:34
white something out I also have some of the Erin Condren snappin bookmarks and these just snap into the coil as well
12:41
but I think I'm going to need to mark several different places in this notebook because I'm going to be working
12:47
in multiple places at once so I have a few of those and I also have the snap-in
12:52
dashboard I'm not sure this is the one I'm going to use or I have a Wonder
12:57
Woman one that actually has the days of the week on the back that might work better so I'll see once I get into the
13:03
project which one feels more practical but for now I'm going to use these wet erase markers so that I can create
13:10
checklists on this as well now there are already checklists in the planner but those are going to be
13:18
very like detailed and focused per project and I would like to also keep a
13:23
checklist overall here for the things I'm currently working on whereas this will have like everything this will have
13:30
just the tasks that I'm gonna do this upcoming week so those are the tools
13:35
most of these are all from Erin Condren so I'll link them down below I also have this pencil pouch from Amazon that works
13:43
kind of in two ways you can open it this way or if you have it unzipped on the side you can also just have it like this
13:50
so in here I mostly have my tombow twin tone dual tip markers Erin Condren has
13:57
gorgeous dual tip markers too so if you want to get everything from her you can and I do have a free $10 code for you
14:03
down below if you've never ordered from Erin Condren but I also just really like the colors of the twin tone markers and
14:09
they have one sort of marker tip and one more plastic nib bulleted tip and I just
14:16
don't use these enough so I thought well this will be a project that I'll use them a little bit more so I have all my
14:23
tools gathered and I've already started setting out what I'm going to do in this
14:28
notebook so you can see here I also used these adorable stickers these are from
14:34
an Etsy shop called Studio adorkable and it's run by a woman named Lacey and she
14:39
sent me a bunch of stickers for free and I have already started using them like crazy especially if you're a writer I
14:46
will link her store down below there are so many amazing so cute cute cute things and this little teal planner felt
14:53
perfect along with the coffee cup for a get head project I also have some of the scalloped sticky notes in case I need
14:59
those so this first page is really the big
15:04
first beginning to the project so what I've done on this first page is just kind of outline what I need to do so the
15:12
first section here is just a list of all of my responsibilities so I have
15:18
basically two sides to my business and my home and I didn't even list anything with the kids here I might add that
15:24
later but right now I just didn't want them to be a part of this because part of the whole reason I'm doing this project is to spend more time
15:31
with the kids and have more family time so I'm not going to include that as part of the get ahead project but it will be
15:37
part of where I spend my time if I do get ahead I have the heart breathing side of my career which is basically
15:43
this YouTube channel my courses and my planners so I listed out everything that I need to keep up with and that I have
15:50
tasks to do on a regular basis for heart breathing's like social media my videos
15:55
for YouTube my planners my coursework and launches for those courses my blog
16:01
posts and my newsletter and the freebie in the resources section so I have all of those things here down at the bottom
16:07
I have my writing career so I have SC for Sara Canon which is my pen name and my actual name so my writing and books
16:14
schedule my vlogs which I've been posting every Sunday but I might switch to Saturday's my social media and
16:20
promotions blog and website and my newsletter for my home my husband does a lot of the cleaning and meal stuff but I
16:28
would like to do some things and I'll show you in my list to help out with that then over here on the side I have a
16:35
checklist of things that I would like to start thinking toward to help me get ahead so for example I want to out lie
16:42
outline tasks that I can hand off are outsourced so for example every time I
16:48
do a video I would love to have a blog post that accompanies that video but I don't always have time to go and create
16:54
a blog post that matches but it's good for SEO and it's great for people who don't have time or aren't able to listen
17:00
to the videos so I would like to hand off the tasks to an assistant or someone
17:06
who's a transcriptionist that can turn my videos into blog posts and have them posted so something like that for
17:13
example and I want to outline all of those tasks that I could outsource I also want to make a list of tasks that I
17:19
could batch so for example let's say I knew I wanted to do four videos in the month of June could I record all four of
17:26
those videos on the same day so that I only have to pull my lighting and my makeup out on one day and then I can
17:32
that I can batch it so also another thing that could work like that is like social media posts or my vlogs some
17:40
things on here could be batched I'm already doing some batching but I'm not super efficient at it so I want to
17:47
get better then I want to actually create a process for my batching so in
17:52
the example of videos my process would be I need to outline the videos and
17:58
decide what I'm going to do for that day I need to get makeup on and get my clothes ready I need to pull my lighting
18:05
out if I'm using a stand for my phone that needs to be out the background needs to be out that notebooks need to
18:11
be pulled out and I want to create an entire like checklist process that I can use every single time I'm doing a video
18:18
and then also a process for what happens once the video is done I upload it to my
18:23
Google Drive I edit it I put it on you know update my thumbnail image things like that and the
18:29
reason I want to create that process is because I don't want to have to reinvent the wheel every single time I'm going to batch a
18:36
set of videos and then forget stuff and then I you know this isn't charged or I should have done this so if I have that
18:42
process in place I will become more efficient at it then I want to make a checklist for the hiring process so all
18:48
of those things that I want to outline and hand off I need to hire a team and start getting that into place for people
18:55
that can take those things off my plate then I need a weekly ideal posting
19:00
schedule so I already have a weekly ideal schedule for myself like a time schedule but I really need a central
19:08
place where I say okay what am i doing on Mondays I post to heart breathing social media I post a sarakin in social
19:14
media I have a new video that comes up every Thursday I do this this and this and I want to have an overview of all
19:21
the things that need to get posted my videos my social media my blog posts my
19:26
newsletter and I just need to create that schedule and it's going to be an ideal schedule I might not always be
19:32
able to stick to it but I would like to know when I intend to do it then creating a task checklist so these are
19:39
things I already have in my HP 90 system but I want to update it and really think through that task list a little bit
19:45
better for q3 then I need to make a Google Drive folder for organizing all of my data organizing the batch process
19:53
organizing where all my images are stored because if I get ahead I'm probably going to be creating things
19:59
ahead of time and storing them somewhere and they don't need to be like one on this computer downstairs one on my
20:05
laptop something on my phone I want to keep it all in Google Drive in a nicely organized way so I need to make those
20:11
folders then I need to make a checklist of things that are one and done project
20:16
so these are projects that are not going to be continuing like posting to social media but things that once they're done
20:23
they're done forever for example like I'm moving my mailing list for Sara
20:29
cannon from MailChimp over to mailer light so in mailer light I need to set
20:34
up my landing pages change the links in the back of my books there's like a whole list of tasks that need to happen
20:39
for that to move over and that's going to be a one and done project once it's all set up I don't have to do that every
20:46
week so I want to make a list of all of those things that are just like the one and done projects in relation to these
20:53
things that are my responsibilities so that I can create a plan for getting those done so I can get on a better
20:59
schedule for the things that are recurring then I want to make a list of templates to create like mailing list
21:05
templates or social media images templates or blog post templates that will make it easier for an assistant to
21:11
step in and help me then I was thinking about stickers for my habits so things
21:17
like my morning and evening routines and my like social media posts did I want to
21:22
have stickers for that so don't have to keep writing it into my planner so I may be creating some stickers for these
21:29
things or I'm gonna go buy stickers for these things but I think that'll help me to have like a set of stickers that look
21:35
the same so that every time I need to have that video posted instead of using
21:40
different stickers that don't catch my eye it's like always the same YouTube sticker I know that sounds like such a
21:46
little thing but I think it will help me identify at a glance then this one is a
21:51
biggie so this is a time tracking system for better estimates so I was telling you guys at the beginning of this video
21:56
that one of the places where I still fall short is I underestimate how much time something will take and then I end
22:03
up overestimating how many things I can get done in a day because I everything
22:08
takes longer than I expected so I have tried several times to come up with a time tracking system that works
22:15
for me and I've never been successful I've tried toggle I've tried lots of apps but I don't always have my phone
22:21
with me I don't always have my phone on and then I get distracted if I pick up my phone so I don't want to use an app
22:27
I'm not always on the same computer I'm not even always on the same browser so that type of thing doesn't work I tried
22:34
a planner sitting on my desk but it was one that had to open all the way and
22:39
it's too big to sit on my desk so then I always ended up putting it on the floor so what I'm going to try now is a
22:46
smaller planner so this one is the eight-and-a-half by 11 Erin Condren but I'm going to use just the normal size
22:52
erin condren which is the 7 by 9 and I'm going to try using the daily duo which is a daily page and I already have a
22:59
daily page in my main planner but like I said that planner is an a5 planner and has to open all the way Plus that
23:06
planner is really for planning out my day before it happens the time tracking system I want to be something separate
23:13
where I'm actually tracking things after they get done I'll give you more about this project later but I'm excited about
23:19
creating a Franken planner basically out of the daily duo which if you've been here on YouTube you've seen probably
23:25
some other people doing this and I'm excited to do I'm just waiting for my
23:31
daily duo to get here and it just shipped so I will definitely give you guys a video and an overview of how I'm
23:36
going to attract my time in that daily planner because I want an accounting of not just like my main hb9 tea planner is
23:44
what I intend to do for the day my checklist the daily duo time tracker is going to be an actual accounting of
23:51
where my time went so if I say in my main planner I'm giving myself an hour to record a video in the time tracking
23:57
planner I'll be able to see if it took me a full hour or if it only took me 45 minutes or if it took me three hours and
24:04
I'll be able to see that and I'm gonna have an entire system for tracking that time over the course of each day each
24:10
week each month and each quarter so I'm excited about that then I'm going to make a 2-week meal plan rotation for our
24:17
house I have been doing a one week meal rotation but then I get bored with what we're eating and I don't feel like it and then
24:23
I changed the plans last minute so we're going to try to week meal plan rotation and then I also want to automate and get
24:30
my advertising and promotions running in a more automated manner so for now this
24:35
is the checklist I'm sure that I will add things to this list over time but this is where I'm starting now I have a
24:42
few pages that are blank here to outline my plan and my timeline for getting this
24:48
done and then I've created a page for each one of these things that are my
24:55
responsibilities so I've got one for social media and what I plan to do on these pages is to write out for example
25:01
for heart breathing social media I'm going to write the social medias that I participate on so Instagram and
25:07
Instagram stories I'm on YouTube obviously I have a Facebook page I have several Facebook groups so I'm on
25:14
Twitter but I don't really use Twitter for heart breathing so I'm going to just post all of those things I also have
25:20
Pinterest with all of my like ideal posting schedule I'm gonna brainstorm out what I want to do with this and then
25:26
how I want to get ahead with it and what ideas I could use to get ahead so for social media it could be something like
25:32
scheduling out my post ahead of time taking my photos ahead of time having
25:38
the whole week planned out at the beginning of the week or maybe even having a whole month's worth of stuff that's ready to go so I'm gonna create
25:45
that plan just for the social media here on these two pages and then I'll create a checklist of action items so if I've
25:52
created the plan over here I'm going to make a checklist like create a folder a
25:57
Google Drive folder for the images that I want to store create an ideal posting
26:03
schedule and so on and I will take you guys through these checklists if you're wanting to see how this progresses let
26:09
me know in the comments hit the thumbs up button if you're enjoying this video and I will create this checklist and I
26:15
will take care of it one step at a time so I have that for all of my things so I've got the videos the planners and all
26:21
of the other heart breathing's things here then I have a few blank pages at the end of the heart breathing section
26:26
in case I need to do more brainstorming but this is where you can see that I'm going to need extra
26:32
bookmarks because I want to have one section that's dedicated to heart breathing's and one section that's
26:38
dedicated to my Sara cannon career so I would put one bookmark at the beginning
26:45
of the heart breathing section one bookmark at the beginning of the Sara cannon section or whichever pages I'm
26:51
working on now so I've got the social media one my writing and books schedule blogs my live video readings
27:00
my promotions and ads my blog and website my newsletter so I've just taken all those things that I listed at the
27:06
front of the planner and I've given them their own two-page spread and I will slowly go through and actually brainstorm and fill this out and outline
27:13
the tasks that need to be done few extra pages there and then we go into home
27:19
life so I'll probably need a third bookmark for this section so like the meals and routines and the
27:25
exercise my morning and evening routines and that sort of thing so here is where
27:30
I'll talk about what the actual routines are how I can get ahead or support myself what stickers I want to use and that
27:36
sort of thing then I've got a few extra pages before I go into this next list so
27:43
the next section of the planner is basically dealing with this checklist over here so the first section is a
27:49
two-page spread for each of these bullet points and now this section is a checklist for all of those checklist
27:56
items so what can I outsource so once I've done all of the work in the front
28:01
part I can make a list of things that I'm going to start outsourcing and I'll have that entire list here on the
28:07
checklist what can I back what can I hire and all those things we went through so I've got
28:12
a two-page spread for all of those items that were on that side checklist like what are my one and done projects so
28:19
that is what I have built up so far like how will I track my time this is where
28:26
I'm going to plan out my Franken planner come up with my color code that I'm going to use in my entire system and
28:31
then I'll create an action checklist for what I'm gonna do like once the daily duo gets here I'm gonna pull it apart
28:37
and create my Franken planner I need to create a color coding system and so on so that will go in the checklist section
28:43
the rest of this so far is not be use and I will just use it as I need to make notes about what I'm doing in the
28:51
future so it like I said if I don't use the whole notebook I will definitely be using it for future things like
28:56
outlining videos or outlining my social media plans and things like that to get ahead but so far this is what I have
29:03
nothing is filled out it's just the bare bones of the system right now my plan is
29:08
to start figuring out what all is going to be involved in each of these main
29:14
projects so I'm going to over the next month fill out these two-page spreads
29:20
and figure out okay what is heart breathing social media entail and what are my action items what are the videos
29:26
going to need to get ahead and what are my action items then what I'll do is when I start planning q3 I know that I'm
29:33
not going to have time for all of this in the next quarter and probably not in the even in the next two quarters all of
29:40
these things are probably going to take me a full year or more to get my systems and my checklist and everything done so
29:46
I'm giving myself plenty of time but this get ahead plan is going to be one of my three goals for q3 and probably
29:53
again in q4 and then q1 of 2021 and so on so what I'll do when I start planning
29:58
q3 is I will start choosing which one's of these I'm going to work on in q3 so I
30:05
might not work on getting ahead with videos but I might get social media for both things up baby's awake but I might
30:13
get social media done for both of them or I might get my vlogs in a better system so I might out of you know 10 or
30:19
15 things I might get two or three done next quarter and then two or three done in q4 and so on but once things get done
30:27
I'm hoping that everything will begin to run more smoothly and that a year from now I'll have an actual team in place
30:33
and I'll have a batching process and like all these one-and-done projects
30:39
will be done I'll have templates all have stickers I'll have a time tracking system and better estimates in place and
30:45
I will be in a much better place and this is one of the things I love about the HB 90 system is it's all about you
30:51
know you pick one or two things and you make actual progress where in the past I would have just looked at all of these
30:57
things and I would have just been like well there's too much to do I'll never get it done I just can't do this YouTube video
31:04
and I would have given up on it now I know that it's really about like divide and conquer so to speak I have really
31:11
outlined the things I need to pay attention to and now all I have to do is each quarter tackle one or two of them
31:17
and get it done and then a little bit more the next time and a little bit more the next time and it makes things so
31:23
much clearer so much more productive and I start to actually clear things off my
31:30
plate so I'm really excited about this get ahead project and I will definitely keep you guys updated as I continue on
31:36
with it okay guys so that was a look at my brand new get ahead plan so like I
31:42
said I'm going to be outlining this a little bit more as I get into planning for q3 so if you aren't familiar with it
31:50
I do run a course called the HB 98 method this is a week-long course that is all about setting goals breaking
31:58
those goals down into manageable projects and tasks based realistically on the time you actually have then you
32:05
take those tasks and you put them up on a Kanban board or a digital Kanban board you schedule them out so that for the
32:12
next three months of your life you know exactly what you're focused in on and less distraction less stress so much
32:20
more clarity on what you're getting done and you're actually doing things so instead of spinning your wheels and
32:26
wondering what's next what's next or letting whatever is beeping at you take your attention you're focused you're
32:33
clear and you're actually seeing results if you're interested in joining that course we are starting a new round in
32:40
June so I would love for you to join me actually this Sunday upcoming Sunday I'm
32:46
going to be opening the doors for the next round of the HP 90 bootcamp I would love to have you in that course so if
32:51
you want to see more information about that go ahead and subscribe to this channel you can also click that link
32:56
down below to get on my newsletter list and I will be sending out a newsletter as soon as the doors are open on Sunday

anytime your own pace whenever you want to take it and you can take it over and over again every single quarter if you'd
33:28
like it also comes with a free copy of my printable HP 90 quarterly planner so
33:33
I would love to have you in that class the great thing about this HP 90 method as hopefully you've seen in this video
33:39
is that you know there's no plan that's just gonna be like your life is perfect within 90 days that just doesn't exist
33:46
but it's all about choosing what you're going to focus on this quarter then the next quarter you get a little bit better
33:53
and the next quarter you get a little bit better ten or fifteen years ago I couldn't have done a quarter of the
33:59
things that I'm doing now but now it's manageable and all I'm trying to do is next quarter
34:04
get a little bit better at it and then the next quarter a little bit better and every time I make one of those little
34:10
baby step incremental upgrades to my life I get happier I get more clear I
34:16
get more excited I'm able to show up better for those of you who are watching me that I can serve and life just gets a
34:23
lot more joyful so if you've been craving that level of clarity and productivity in your own life I hope
34:31

34:47
hopefully I will see you in the HP 90 bootcamp this next round all right you guys bye
34:53

hey guys so I am back to talk a little
0:03
bit about how I plan my days inside my
0:06
HP 90 planner and this would work for
0:08
any planner basically that you're using
0:09
or even just a notebook or anything like
0:11
that but I just want to give you guys
0:13
kind of an inside look at how I plan and
0:15
prepare my day so that I get a lot done
0:17
this kind of system has really been
0:20
helping me a lot lately so if you're
0:21
interested in seeing more stay tuned
0:23
okay so I'm obviously working
0:28
specifically in my HP 90 planner today
0:31
which is the planner that I have
0:32
actually designed myself for writers
0:35
because I found that none of the
0:37
planners that I was using exactly we're
0:40
structured in a way that I needed them
0:42
to be because I need a daily page but I
0:44
also need a weekly overview and a lot of
0:47
the planners out there that have weekly
0:49
overviews don't have daily pages or vice
0:52
versa so like the day designer or
0:55
whatever they have a monthly overview
0:56
and then a daily page for every day but
0:59
there's no overview of the entire week
1:01
and I found that just the way that I
1:03
like to plan and what works best for me
1:05
efficiency wise is to have a monthly a
1:09
weekly and a daily view and if you've
1:12
been watching this channel for a while
1:13
you know that that's why I loved the
1:15
Hopa Nietzsche but the problem with the
1:17
Hoba Nietzsche is because it's a bound
1:19
book you don't necessarily have the
1:22
ability to add things to it so then I
1:24
would find I had all these other
1:25
notebooks that I was keeping track of
1:27
other types of things like my social
1:29
media stats and like blog notes and
1:32
other things like that so I ended up
1:34
last year going back into my 6
1:37
ringbinder system and I switch out my
1:39
actual binder every month so this month
1:42
I'm in my purple patent leather original
1:45
Filofax but every month I switch it out
1:48
and it allows me to switch out the color
1:50
of the binder and the way that the
1:51
planner looks with colors and different
1:54
things like that but to keep the insides
1:56
the same and this system has been
1:58
working for me now really really well
2:00
for about a year and or a little bit
2:02
less than a year actually and I'm just
2:04
absolutely loving it so I wanted to give
2:06
you a little bit of a peek into what I
2:07
do to plan my days because I've talked a
2:10
little bit and done
2:10
some plan with meson planning my weeks
2:13
or months but I've never really done the
2:15
days so here we go so basically just
2:18
kind of going back to the weeks at the
2:21
beginning of every week in this planner
2:23
and this is what I was kind of doing the
2:25
Hoban Ichi as well I have three goals
2:27
every quarter I plan 90 day segments 90
2:31
days at a time in the beginning of every
2:33
quarter I will set three main goals for
2:36
myself usually one has to do with my
2:38
writing one has to do with like
2:40
promotions and community building with
2:42
my fans and then the third goal usually
2:44
has to do with this channel with heart
2:45
breathing's and the courses and the
2:47
videos that I put out and stuff like
2:48
that so I take those goals and then I
2:51
look at my time realistically I figure
2:53
out what projects I have time for and
2:54
then I break those projects down into
2:56
little bitty tasks and I have lists of
2:58
all those tasks I also have a Kanban
3:00
board that has sticky notes that have
3:02
all my tasks on it for the quarter so
3:04
that way I know exactly what I need to
3:06
work on like every single thing I need
3:08
to do throughout the next 90 days and
3:10
then I just sort of chip away at it
3:12
every day so here's my process at the
3:14
beginning of every week I will go into
3:16
these three columns with the three goals
3:18
and I will take a look at my sticky
3:20
notes and the things that haven't gotten
3:21
done yet and I will write down four goal
3:24
number one here's the tasks that I want
3:26
to do so like I'm working on my book
3:28
called fates surrender I kind of hit a
3:30
wall so I've been reading some of it to
3:32
try to get you know past the wall that
3:35
I'm at I'm getting close to getting done
3:37
with it but I've just hit a wall so I
3:38
need to go back and do some plot then
3:40
I'm gonna be working on deaths awakening
3:42
which is the first book in that series
3:43
and I'm gonna be rewriting the blurb and
3:45
redoing some things on that like the key
3:48
words new taglines and things like that
3:50
I also have some other plants that I'm
3:52
sort of working on mapping out for a new
3:54
project then goal number two which is
3:56
more of my community building and like
3:58
fans and stuff like that I've gotten big
4:01
newsletter project I've been working on
4:02
this quarter and then I also wanted to
4:05
record a bullet journal set up this week
4:07
for my author YouTube channel and then I
4:10
always try to plan out social media for
4:12
the week at the beginning of the week
4:13
now this week with goal number three I
4:15
actually came in to the second tab here
4:18
cuz where I've drawn this line this is
4:19
all goal number three because this is a
4:21
pretty heavy big busy week for my
4:24
heartbeat
4:24
Channel so I'm putting out several
4:26
videos my q2 planner actually just came
4:28
out today so if you've been waiting for
4:30
the second quarter HP 90 print planner
4:33
principle to go up on etsy it is up now
4:35
so you can go ahead and grab that
4:37
there's also an undated version that you
4:38
can print over and over again and so I'm
4:44
also got my course the HP 90 course is
4:47
launching this weekend it starts on
4:50
Thursday night so I just have a lot of
4:51
things going on for that so I've got
4:53
tons and tons of little things plus I
4:55
hit 15,000 subscribers and I'm running a
4:57
giveaway so I've got lots of tasks going
4:59
for that so at the beginning of the week
5:00
I figure out on Sunday night's like
5:02
exactly what tasks I'm going to be
5:04
working on write down any other extra
5:06
little things I write down where my
5:08
social media is for both heart
5:10
breathing's and for my Sarah cannon
5:12
stuff I have a note here of what how
5:15
many words I want to write what blog I
5:16
want to write and any of the top
5:18
priority things that I want to do so
5:19
this is kind of my like weekly dashboard
5:21
and that comes into play pretty heavily
5:24
when you start talking about how I play
5:25
in my day it's because I wouldn't know
5:27
what needed to get done on a daily basis
5:29
if I hadn't already gone through this
5:30
process on Sunday night figuring out
5:33
what I'm gonna tackle for the week
5:35
because what I used to do was I didn't
5:38
really have a plan for the court or a
5:39
plan for the week I just woke up every
5:41
day and whatever pulled at my attention
5:43
like this email this emergency this
5:46
thing over here oh I really need to do
5:48
the laundry I need to go get this
5:49
somebody's messaging me over here and
5:51
whatever would pull at my attention that
5:52
seemed urgent was what I would get done
5:55
and then I would end up at the end of a
5:56
month or the end of a week and go gosh I
5:58
pretty much don't even know where I
6:00
spent my time how come I didn't get my
6:02
newsletter done how come I didn't finish
6:03
writing as many words as I wanted and I
6:05
felt like I had no control over my time
6:07
so when I started doing this I started
6:10
getting really deliberate about exactly
6:13
what I was going to do now every once in
6:15
a while there will be things that come
6:17
up that don't fit into this list that I
6:19
have to get done there are emergencies
6:21
that come up people email me and need
6:23
help with something that I haven't you
6:24
know put on my list for the most part I
6:27
try to push things off for next week or
6:29
not let those things take priority I try
6:32
to make the things that are on this list
6:34
that are my tasks that need to get done
6:36
for the quarter
6:37
my priority because I've specifically
6:39
laid these tasks out to help me hit my
6:42
major goals and those goals are what's
6:44
most important to me so this is where I
6:47
have learned to really focus my time so
6:49
this is super important when it comes to
6:51
planning my days and everything on this
6:53
list eventually gets moved to what's
6:55
going on in my daily life so this is the
6:58
weekly overview that I was talking about
7:00
now this typically looks like looks like
7:05
this where you've got the dates at the
7:07
top work in progress here a little
7:09
section for notes with a habit tracker
7:11
you can write any promotions you have
7:12
and I there's like checklists at the
7:14
bottom I like to use those for social
7:16
media so it's blank like this but I like
7:18
to get planner printables from Etsy
7:21
where I can print out I have a Cricut
7:23
and I like to print out my own stickers
7:25
and sort of design the way I want and
7:28
because it's a printable kit I can
7:29
resize it so the ones that are made for
7:32
Erin Condren I can resize them for my
7:34
heart breathing planner because Erin
7:37
Condren is like one and a half inches
7:40
for every box and so all I have to do is
7:42
go in and resize them in the cricut to
7:44
be one and a quarter inch and then they
7:46
fit perfectly in my planner so a little
7:48
bit of extra work on Sundays but it's
7:50
kind of meditative for me and I listen
7:52
to podcasts while I do it takes me about
7:53
30 minutes a week to print and cut all
7:55
these stickers so anyway I will go
7:58
through the week and I will take each
8:00
day and I will figure out from this list
8:04
what's going to try to get done on this
8:06
day like this day I might be recording
8:08
this day I'm going to work on you know
8:11
my newsletter project this what day I'm
8:13
going to be mostly writing and I just
8:15
sort of plan out my days along with
8:16
anything that's time-sensitive like I
8:19
have a closing call for my boot camp or
8:21
on Thursday night I have a kickoff call
8:24
at 8:00 p.m. so that kind of stuff goes
8:26
on my weekly plan here and I just plan
8:29
it out so that's my like weekly overview
8:31
and my weekly dashboard then we get into
8:34
my daily plan so as you can see every
8:37
single day has its own page and I print
8:41
out an a5 but this planner also comes in
8:43
letter size if you wanted to use a
8:44
binder or like a big happy planner you
8:47
could do that as well the a5 is a little
8:49
bit more of a pain to
8:50
you print and cut yourself unless you've
8:52
got experience doing that but it's worth
8:54
the pain for me because I just like this
8:55
size but basically this is the daily
8:59
page and you can see the blank one over
9:02
here I've got basically a time schedule
9:04
over here from 6:00 a.m. to 10:00 p.m.
9:06
or really 11:00 p.m. you can write out
9:09
your schedule then there's a blank space
9:10
here a blank box and a blank space here
9:13
with three lines at the top and that's
9:14
all the structure there is but what I
9:18
like the way I like to use it is at the
9:19
beginning of the day I will write out
9:21
what are my top three things that have
9:23
to get done and yesterday I actually got
9:25
all three of these things done so I
9:26
usually like to put a checkmark there or
9:29
cross through them so these are my like
9:31
must do even if I don't get to
9:32
everything then I will go over to this
9:36
time bar and I will figure out what is
9:38
my time schedule look like for the day
9:40
and I don't fill this stuff out ahead of
9:43
time because it changes so like if I had
9:46
woken up this morning and my son had a
9:48
sore throat and couldn't go to school
9:49
then it would really have messed up my
9:50
whole day and I would had this like
9:52
would have been a useless page so that's
9:55
why I love the weekly overview cuz I can
9:57
go ahead and kind of plan what I want to
9:58
get done on this day but having the
10:00
daily page gives me the flexibility to
10:02
go back and say well it's not going to
10:04
work out like I thought because I've got
10:06
this other thing that needs to happen so
10:08
now I'm going to start with a fresh
10:09
slate and plan the day so I plan the
10:12
weekly stuff on Sundays but then every
10:14
day a plan in the morning so today is
10:17
Tuesday the 19th so I would plan my top
10:20
three things for the day up here at the
10:22
top and so my top three things for the
10:24
day are to get the q2 planner up so get
10:31
it listed which it was being proof read
10:33
last night by a few different people so
10:35
the planner gets listed today the second
10:37
thing that needs to get done today is I
10:39
need to mail out a giveaway I'm late
10:43
getting it out so that has to get done
10:45
today it's priority and then my third
10:49
priority is this video so I will say
10:52
just I'm just going to put video and
10:55
then beside it I'll put days because I
10:58
know that's what I'm talking about so I
11:00
will sit down first like usually when
11:02
we're at breakfast and I'll just
11:03
I doubt okay I know these are my top
11:05
three things to do now I don't need to
11:08
add stickers and stuff to it but because
11:09
I like to make things prettier I like to
11:13
add stickers I also will show you how
11:15
much I like washi tape so you can see
11:17
this bottom little section down here
11:19
I've pretty much designed this planner
11:21
specifically with enough space at the
11:23
bottom for a basic roll of washi tape
11:25
because I like to put a strip of washi
11:26
tape down at the bottom so if you ever
11:28
wondered why there's a little space at
11:30
the bottom of the planner it's because I
11:31
like to take a coordinating color and
11:33
put washi tape on it I also usually have
11:36
like a set of stickers that I'm using
11:37
for the week so this is those printables
11:40
that I was talking about that I cut
11:41
myself and I will use some of these
11:43
extra little things throughout my
11:45
planning and then I also have some other
11:47
little printable icons like Mayo laptops
11:51
little clocks and different things like
11:52
that that I will use and I will link
11:55
down below which at-sea shops I got
11:57
these from I think all of these actually
11:59
came from the planner Shack so I will
12:01
link those for you down below if you
12:03
have your own like cutting machine or
12:05
you don't mind cutting your own stickers
12:06
it's really inexpensive way to get cute
12:09
stickers without having to pay and have
12:11
them shipped and everything to put them
12:12
yourself so alright so then I would go
12:15
through and I basically plan my time
12:17
that's the second thing that I do every
12:19
day so I'm just going to go ahead and do
12:21
that
12:27
I like to block these off like little
12:32
blocks here so I know I'm going to do a
12:34
little bit of admin work in the morning
12:36
which is usually email stuff my morning
12:38
block of time usually from 9:00 to noon
12:41
is to work on my books
12:43
so whether I'm editing or plotting I'm
12:46
almost always in this block of time
12:47
working on my books so here I'm gonna be
12:50
writing then we're getting lunch out
12:55
today so that's gonna take a little bit
12:57
of extra time then I'm just not
13:00
recording this video so obviously I
13:06
didn't actually do this this morning
13:08
because I knew I wanted to record it so
13:09
I'm recording it in the afternoon and
13:11
filling this out in the afternoon but I
13:13
would normally do this first thing in
13:15
the morning
13:21
so this stretch of time this two-hour
13:23
stretch is going to be to record this
13:25
video and to go ahead and get my planner
13:27
listed on Etsy so that it will be up
13:29
before this video goes live and then
13:32
I've got to get to the mailbox or post
13:35
office today and then that's pretty much
13:39
going to be my working day because I
13:41
worked pretty late last night and I just
13:44
don't want to work super late tonight so
13:46
I'm gonna spend time like family time
13:48
will go here and I'm not even going to
13:49
mark that then we'll have dinner around
13:51
6:00 and then this time in the evening
13:55
we'll be with my son and my husband and
14:02
I have just started playing Final
14:03
Fantasy online we were playing Wow but
14:06
we were kind of getting bored with it so
14:08
we have started characters on Final
14:09
Fantasy so I'm gonna be gaming some
14:11
tonight but this way I'm kind of
14:13
planning out exactly what I'm gonna get
14:14
done throughout the day so once I know
14:17
those are my time blocks those are my
14:19
blocks of time that I've got stuff
14:20
that's going to get done then I will sit
14:23
down and I will pick out like the colors
14:25
that I want to use for the day and
14:27
sometimes I will use these little ones
14:30
that use headers for what I'm going to
14:32
do and sometimes I just use icons like
14:33
I'm going to do today so I grabbed this
14:35
little laptop that kind of matches the
14:37
colors and I'm going to write down the
14:38
admin work
14:39
that I need to do so I usually will put
14:42
a little header here that says admin and
14:44
then I need to write down all the little
14:49
things that I need to talk about and I
14:53
just will make myself little notes like
14:55
I know that this is like email so I need
14:57
to get back to so I've got three
15:02
basically like three big email things
15:04
that I need to deal with this morning
15:06
then my writing time I'm going to use a
15:10
little desk here for this so I've got
15:12
this little disc so I'm going to use
15:15
this little icon with the desk here and
15:17
I'm gonna put writing and this you can't
15:23
really see it probably from in the
15:24
camera but this has little dock right
15:26
here if you wanted to use this kind of
15:28
more like a bullet journal and sometimes
15:29
I do that like you can see over here
15:30
that I have we use the little boxes
15:33
sometimes I do that sometimes I just use
15:35
like little bullet points so with my
15:38
writing today I would like to get my
15:41
goal was to get 3,000 words and I did
15:44
that then so I'm going to take this
15:48
little planner icon here and I'm going
15:51
to put HP 90 planner
16:00
so that's basically all the things that
16:03
I'm getting done today and this way I've
16:05
got my times blocked off and now I have
16:07
the actual like bullet points tasks that
16:09
I'm going to do and those are all things
16:11
that are also listed on this monthly or
16:14
this weekly task list
16:16
so like the q2 planner the recording of
16:20
how I plan my days so as soon as this
16:22
stuff is done I also will go over here
16:24
and I will check it off that I got it
16:26
completed so then what do I do with the
16:28
rest of this space so this little box
16:30
you know I leave it in the planner to do
16:33
whatever you want to use with it but I
16:35
like to use this little box over here
16:37
for writing sprints so I ended up
16:40
getting for writing sprints done oops
16:44
today and I don't have those numbers
16:46
with me because I wrote them on a spare
16:48
sheet of paper but what I'll do is I'll
16:50
usually write out like 200 words 600
16:53
words here 300 words or whatever and
16:54
then I'll write my total down at the
16:56
bottom so I do know that my total words
16:58
today was three thousand one hundred and
17:01
twenty three words so I did hit my goal
17:03
so then I would come over here and I
17:05
would put a checkmark and sometimes I
17:07
would also just like slash that out then
17:10
this bottom segment is a lot more like
17:13
open of you know what I can do with it
17:16
like yesterday I hit 15 thousand
17:18
subscribers so I made a little note to
17:20
like remember that I that was the day I
17:22
did it and I wrote a little bit of
17:24
journaling sometimes I use this for like
17:26
quotes that I want to remember and
17:27
actually another thing that I need to
17:29
put on here that I will go to the post
17:31
office and do in just a minute is that I
17:36
need to mail out that giveaway so that
17:42
should go up here and my tasks so then
17:44
this bottom thing what do I want to
17:46
write out well I've just gotten back
17:48
from lunch with my husband and I felt
17:50
the baby kick for the first time so even
17:52
though this is not something that is
17:53
related to my work I definitely want to
17:56
mark that in my planner because I just
17:57
want to remember so I'm going to grab
17:59
this little bow and I'm going to write a
18:01
little bit about that so that's just a
18:04
little thing to always remember and when
18:06
I'm flipping back through my planner
18:08
later I can kind of have it as a little
18:11
bit of memories you could use this for
18:13
- you could also use this for like
18:16
continuing your task list you could use
18:18
it for things like you know you want to
18:20
do tomorrow so you could have your tasks
18:22
up here and then as things come up
18:24
throughout the day somebody says oh I
18:25
need remember I need to get this
18:26
remember I need to get this you could
18:28
use this as kind of like a little
18:29
holding spot for the things you want to
18:31
get done tomorrow but this is basically
18:34
how I plan my days is I sit down every
18:38
Sunday and I figure out which tasks I'm
18:41
going to get done for the week and these
18:43
tasks all come from my quarterly plan so
18:46
I'm not like spending a ton of time
18:48
trying to figure out every day or every
18:51
week gosh what should i do what should I
18:52
do
18:52
that's a huge time waster for me I sit
18:55
down for a couple of days every quarter
18:58
so I'm about to do that since we're
18:59
about to start quarter two of the year
19:01
and I'm gonna plan out everything I'm
19:03
doing for April May and June so then I
19:06
don't really have to put much thought
19:07
into it other than at the beginning of
19:09
the week which ones of those things do I
19:11
have to do it takes so much stress off
19:13
my plate it takes so much like confusion
19:16
what am I gonna work on I don't have to
19:18
sit around wondering I don't waste time
19:21
I don't come into my office every day
19:22
going I don't know what to do what
19:24
should I spend my time on and then
19:26
allowing my attention to get fractured
19:28
between what other people are demanding
19:30
of me or what seems like it needs to get
19:32
done or what I feel like doing today I
19:34
can I have so much peace I can't even
19:36
tell you guys I have so much peace now
19:38
knowing exactly what I'm gonna get done
19:40
and like I said I spend a couple of days
19:43
at the end of every quarter preparing
19:45
for the following quarter I figure out
19:47
everything I'm gonna work on everything
19:49
that's gonna move me forward towards my
19:51
dreams and then I every week will sit
19:54
down pick out which tasks go for this
19:56
week and then every day I pick tasks off
20:00
those lists and I you know add them to
20:03
the day and say this is what's gonna get
20:04
done and I'm telling you I'm getting so
20:06
much more done in a quarter than I even
20:09
was getting in a year before you know
20:10
before this so it's just like hugely not
20:15
only like tripled probably my
20:17
productivity but it also has given me so
20:21
much peace of mind of being like I know
20:22
exactly what I'm going to do and that
20:24
alone like I'm a natural procrastinator
20:26
so
20:27
that alone like motivates me to start
20:29
getting stuff done because I don't have
20:31
to like have any excuses of why I'm not
20:33
getting it done this is what's on the
20:35
plan for today this is what I'm going to
20:37
get done and if I had woken up today and
20:39
things had been different than I
20:40
expected like my son was sick or I
20:42
wasn't feeling well which has been
20:43
happening a lot with this pregnancy then
20:45
I would take on only the things I really
20:46
felt like doing but I would still know
20:48
that I've got a few days to catch up and
20:50
by the time Friday or Saturday rolls
20:52
around I need to be making sure I'm
20:54
clicking everything off that list that I
20:56
can so it's been just an amazing program
20:58
for me and I hope that seeing this laid
21:01
out gives you some ideas of how you can
21:03
use your own planner or adopt your own
21:05
planner or if you'd like to pick up the
21:07
HP 90 planner which is more than just a
21:10
planner itself it actually walks you
21:11
through my whole process in terms of
21:13
goal-setting so if you're interested in
21:15
the q2 planner that has actually gone up
21:18
on etsy today there's also an undated
21:21
planner that doesn't have dates so you
21:22
can print it out over and over again
21:23
every time without having to worry about
21:25
the date so you just fill in the dates
21:26
yourself so either one of those they're
21:29
both available on etsy right now and
21:31
also if you want more guidance on how to
21:35
set your goals you want a little bit
21:37
more personal attention from me and to
21:39
see an entire set of videos where I walk
21:41
you through my entire process and this
21:43
is not just like hey how to plan stuff
21:46
it's also like really how to take a look
21:48
at what it is you want for your life and
21:50
how to really start making progress
21:51
toward that so it's a real goal-setting
21:53
course that's going to help you learn to
21:56
figure out what it is you really want
21:58
and how you're going to get there so
22:00
it's a three day bootcamp it actually

23:07
[Music]
hey guys welcome back to heart
0:01
breathing's today we are going to talk
0:03
about a topic that is very near and dear
0:05
to my heart which is how I organize my
0:08
time as a writer so the reason this is
0:15
something that is really near and dear
0:17
to my heart is that when I first started
0:19
self-publishing I was really just
0:21
thinking I want to write and it was all
0:23
that really mattered to me and up until
0:25
that point that have been really my only
0:27
job other than a blog here and there
0:29
like a post here and there getting to
0:31
know some other writers online through
0:33
NaNoWriMo locally and different things
0:35
like that really writing was just my job
0:37
right but then when I started
0:39
self-publishing and this is true even
0:41
for people who are traditionally
0:42
publishing you start to realize that oh
0:45
my gosh there's a lot more to this job
0:47
than just writing there's the marketing
0:50
there's the promotions there's all the
0:52
social media there's the blog posts
0:54
there's you know all these different
0:56
types of promotions that you could be
0:58
doing with like cross promotion and box
1:00
sets and loss leaders and now this is
1:02
different than it was even back when I
1:04
started in 2010 you also have you know
1:07
AMS ads Facebook ads to learn you've got
1:10
to be a newsletter guru you've got to
1:12
know all of these things so when you
1:14
become an entrepreneur and whether
1:16
you're a hybrid author traditionally
1:18
published or self-published it just
1:20
seems like there's more and more things
1:22
getting added to our list so how do you
1:24
do it all how do you organize your time
1:26
and of course I'm super lucky that I get
1:29
to write full-time but this in terms of
1:32
managing what time you have is even more
1:34
important if you're limited in your time
1:37
such as you know I have a six year old
1:39
so he's gone during the day but he's
1:41
home in the evenings and I've got a lot
1:43
to do when like he's in the bath now so
1:45
you may actually hear him making noise
1:47
and I'm trying to record this video
1:48
before I have to go help get him to bed
1:50
but I'm also expecting a baby in August
1:53
and that's going to kind of throw my
1:55
schedule up for a loop because I'm gonna
1:57
have a baby home all day with me as well
1:59
so managing my time becomes extremely
2:02
important if you have a full-time job
2:03
this is obviously a huge issue for you
2:06
because you've only got limited time
2:08
throughout the day when you actually
2:10
have available time to write much less
2:12
do all the marketing and
2:13
motion and you know if you're in this
2:14
you completely understand exactly what
2:16
I'm talking about and how it's important
2:18
to manage your time so what I'm gonna do
2:20
is I'm gonna just give you a glimpse
2:21
into how I manage my time as a writer
2:24
some of this might work for you some of
2:26
it might not but sometimes just seeing
2:27
someone else's process and seeing how it
2:29
works for them can be valuable so let's
2:32
talk about five steps to how I organize
2:34
my time as a writer so this may sound
2:37
like something that you know like why
2:39
would I need to know this but this is
2:41
like the fundamental thing one of the
2:43
most important things that helped me to
2:44
make the shift of like really focusing
2:47
in on where it was most important to
2:48
spend my time which is knowing what I
2:52
want for my life like having this
2:54
overall ideal vision and that may seem
Know Your Vision
2:56
like well how does that help you manage
2:58
your time that's ridiculous like
2:59
spending all this time thinking about
3:01
your long-term vision doesn't do
3:03
anything to help you manage the
3:04
day-to-day but if you think that then
3:06
I'm telling you you're missing out on an
3:08
opportunity because when I sat down and
3:11
I really started thinking what is it I
3:13
want for my life not what do other
3:16
people expect of me what are my readers
3:18
expect of me what do I need to do to
3:20
make other people think that I'm
3:22
successful because let's face it
3:23
sometimes as humans our ego gets in the
3:26
way and we just want other people to
3:28
look at us and think that we're
3:29
successful and to think that we're
3:31
making it you know and we don't want
3:32
anyone to look at us and think that
3:33
we're failing so sometimes that can
3:35
begin to influence our decisions or at
3:37
least that's been the case for me and so
3:40
I had to step back and say you know if I
3:42
take everybody else off the table and I
3:44
just look at Sarah and I say what is it
3:47
that I want for my life if I close my
3:49
eyes and I imagine that ideal vision for
3:51
the future what does it look like and
3:53
once I started to get a very clear
3:55
vision of what my ideal life looks like
3:58
it started to guide all of my decisions
4:01
so every little thing when I was trying
4:03
to decide is this important is this
4:04
something I want to do should I get on
4:06
to this new social media platform I've
4:08
got this new idea for a series should I
4:10
explore that or should I stick to the
4:12
old you know things that I was writing
4:14
should I stick to paranormal or try out
4:15
this contemporary every single question
4:17
that I had became easier to answer
4:20
because I knew what direction I was
4:23
pointed in so knowing the ideal vision
4:26
for my
4:26
life in the long term began to guide my
4:28
decision so that was the really the
4:30
first step I took toward organizing my
4:32
time because the truth is something
4:35
that's super important that you need to
4:36
understand is that there just is
4:38
literally no way that you can get it all
4:40
done you cannot be active on every
4:43
single social media and have hundreds of
4:44
thousands of followers and be posting
4:46
Instagram stories and YouTube stories
4:47
and YouTube videos and Facebook stories
4:49
in a group and a page you just can't do
4:52
it all not by yourself and unless you
4:53
just are independently wealthy and are
4:55
ready to train an entire team of social
4:57
media specialists and add specialists
5:00
and all of that in addition to writing
5:01
your books you just can't do it all it's
5:04
too overwhelming and if you try to do it
5:06
all you're just gonna kind of halfway do
5:08
every tiny little thing and you're going
5:10
to end up with a lot of incompleted
5:12
projects or like oh I've kind of started
5:14
working on my newsletter but I don't
5:16
have that fully in place the way I want
5:17
it to be and I tried to play around a
5:19
little bit with Facebook Ads but I never
5:21
really found the time to dedicate to it
5:22
so you're not gonna be making impact on
5:24
anything and the reason I know this is
5:27
because this was my life I spent several
5:29
years where it was like I was sort of
5:31
dipping my toe into everything because I
5:33
thought I had to do it all and so when I
5:36
finally realized that okay I surrender I
5:40
give up I cannot do it all there's just
5:42
no way it's all getting done I realized
5:44
I had to focus in on what was most
5:46
important so coming up with a very clear
5:49
vision of what my ideal future looked
5:51
like what kind of writer I want to be
5:53
what kind of person I want to be how
5:55
much contact I want to have with my fans
5:56
how much money I want to make what kind
5:58
of lifestyle I want to have in terms of
6:00
spending time with my family having
6:02
another child you know all of those
6:04
things came into play and once I came up
6:06
with a very clear vision of my future
6:08
that like I said began to like guide all
6:13
of my decisions about all those little
6:15
things so once I had that guide figured
6:18
out the number two step that I took was
6:20
I started planning in ninety-day cents
6:22
and I've talked about this on my channel
Plan Quarterly
6:24
before but if you're new here you may
6:25
not be familiar with this so I plan
6:28
quarterly so March or January February
6:30
March is q1 of this year
6:33
you know I'm in the third month of this
6:35
quarter of this 90 days and it's coming
6:37
up on where I'm about to do a review of
6:39
the
6:39
quarter take a look at my goals and how
6:42
everything went how well I did and then
6:44
I'm gonna start planning for April May
6:46
and June which is the second quarter of
6:48
the year and I do this you know
6:50
throughout the year every single quarter
6:53
where I review how things went before I
6:55
really and where I'm going how far I've
6:58
gotten you know on how much progress
7:00
I've made on my goals like am I making
7:02
the amount of money I want to make do I
7:04
want to focus more on like my contact
7:07
with my fans do I want to focus on my
7:09
newsletter and I can take all those
7:11
things that seem like they're so
7:13
important and I can say okay here's how
7:15
much time I can realistically look at
7:17
how much time I have over the next 90
7:18
days and I can begin to focus in on
7:21
what's actually gonna get done what are
7:23
my main projects what are my main goals
7:25
and actually I start with goals and I
7:27
set three goals every 90 days and then
7:30
underneath those goals I set projects so
7:33
if I say my goal is to make twenty five
7:36
thousand dollars a month then I would
7:37
set projects underneath that goal that
7:39
are going to help me to make more money
7:42
so it could be you know usually it
7:44
involves writing more books because
7:46
that's going to be one of the number one
7:47
things that brings in more money and it
7:49
also becomes about my promotions and
7:51
things that are happening you know
7:53
behind the scenes like with Facebook Ads
7:54
and so forth that are going to increase
7:56
my income like applying for bookbub ads
7:58
and running other types of advertising
8:00
for my books so I would decide what
8:03
projects I have time for that are going
8:05
to help me increase my income and then
8:07
once I have my projects figured out I
8:09
break those projects down into tasks so
8:12
my goal like spread would look something
8:15
like you know to increase my income to
8:17
$25,000 per month would be the goal then
8:20
the project might be to publish and
8:22
promote book 11 of my shadow demon saga
8:25
and then another project under that
8:28
might be to implement a new Facebook Ads
8:31
campaign and I'm just making all this up
8:33
as I go so these are not well they're
8:35
close to my actual goals and projects
8:36
then I would take the project of like
8:38
implementing a new Facebook Ads campaign
8:40
and I would break that down into smaller
8:42
tasks so I would say you know I need to
8:45
come up like brainstorm ad copy you know
8:47
create new images talk to friends about
8:50
what's been working come up with
8:51
comparable authors to target on
8:53
Facebook Ads you know might even mean
8:56
hiring a Facebook Ads manager who could
8:57
help me with my Facebook Ads I've never
8:59
done that before but I might be doing
9:01
that in the future so if that became a
9:02
project for me or a task I would do that
9:05
so basically what I'm doing is I'm
9:08
taking a realistic look at my next 90
9:11
days and my schedule and I'm figuring
9:13
out what projects are going to help me
9:15
reach my goals and then I'm breaking
9:17
those projects down into tasks and you
9:19
can see a little sliver of it here and
9:21
I've talked about this extensively on my
9:22
channel so you can go looking for some
9:24
of those videos and I'll link some of
9:25
them down for you below but once I have
9:27
all of those tasks figured out I
9:29
separate those main three goals and I
9:32
give them a color so you can see right
9:34
now I've got kind of like a blue green
9:36
and pink are my main like business goals
9:39
the yellow is my personal goal so that's
9:41
kind of a separate thing but those three
9:42
first three goals are my big ones for my
9:44
business and every single task that I
9:47
plan to complete in the next 90 days
9:49
goes up on that Kanban board and
9:51
throughout the 90 days I'm moving stuff
9:53
down into what is called the done column
9:55
and if you're interested in more about
9:56
the Kanban board like I said I'll link
9:58
that below so I don't have to go into it
10:00
too much here in this video since I've
10:01
covered it before part of the key here
10:03
is remember I started with that vision
10:06
for my life and that vision guides all
10:09
of the decisions that I'm making when it
10:11
comes to my projects so the main two
10:13
things that I consider when I'm setting
10:15
my goals projects and tasks for the
10:17
quarter is what's a realistic view of
10:19
how much I can actually get done so I'm
10:21
not biting off more than I can chew
10:22
because I used to constantly take on too
10:25
much and I always felt like a failure
10:27
because nothing was getting done so when
10:29
I step back and I become realistic about
10:31
my time then it allows me to be
10:33
successful and to actually complete
10:35
projects so at that point I can go ahead
10:38
and get everything done that you know
10:41
that I have time for in that quarter and
10:43
they usually don't clear everything off
10:44
my board you can see with only a month
10:46
left I'm Way behind it this time because
10:48
I had pretty severe morning sickness the
10:50
first part of my pregnancy and that's
10:52
just how it goes sometimes sometimes
10:54
life gets in the way but I've still
10:56
gotten significant things done and I'm
10:57
getting close to finishing another book
10:59
so I'm always moving forward and that's
11:01
part of how I focused my time and
11:03
organize my time every day when I come
11:05
in here I know exactly
11:07
I'm working on and that is huge so the
11:10
third step is that when a quarter begins
11:13
I kind of look at my schedule and I do
11:15
some block scheduling I haven't ever
Block Schedule
11:17
done a video on like calendar blocking
11:20
but there are plenty of videos out there
11:22
I will actually link one from Amy Amy
11:24
Landy know where she talks about how she
11:26
calendar blocks and this will give you
11:27
kind of a good idea but I'll just give
11:29
you a basic overview of what I do
11:31
so if I decide that 9:00 to noon every
11:33
day is my writing time then I would
11:35
block that off in my planner as this is
11:38
my writing time from 9:00 to noon and I
11:40
basically schedule my days in big blocks
11:43
of time because what I don't want to be
11:45
doing is being distracted throughout the
11:48
day and having my attention pulled from
11:49
one thing to another so I don't want to
11:51
say well I'm gonna be writing and then I
11:54
write for 30 minutes and then I do a
11:55
little bit of email and a little bit of
11:57
advertising and then I switched to you
11:59
know phone call and then I get back to
12:02
writing because the more I'm switching
12:04
that's called context switching and the
12:06
more I switch from one activity to
12:08
another the more focus I lose and the
12:11
more productivity I lose so hopefully
12:14
that makes sense but basically you get
12:17
more done it's proven psychologically
12:18
that you get more done if you focus on a
12:20
single task for a longer period of time
12:22
there's also a book out there by Cal
12:24
Newport called deep work where he sort
12:26
of talks about this like taking away all
12:28
the distractions and focusing on this
12:30
one project or tasks for a long period
12:33
of time so I block out my schedule in
12:35
that way and I try to do things in
12:37
batches so I try to write every day
12:39
usually in the morning sometimes it
12:41
becomes an evening thing depending on
12:43
the day and then my afternoons are
12:44
blocked off for things like recording
12:47
videos and instead of recording just one
12:49
video at a time I often will batch my
12:51
videos and try to do two or three on a
12:53
certain day so this is actually the
12:55
third video that I've done today and you
12:57
might my son is being kind of loud in
12:59
the back so you might hear him because
13:00
here I am at 8 o'clock at night and I am
13:02
still recording but that's because this
13:04
was my batch day to do it and that means
13:07
that tomorrow I can batch my edits and
13:08
get things uploaded and it just overall
13:11
is more productive for me to spend a 3
13:13
hour or 4 hour chunk of time recording
13:16
because then I can put my makeup on I
13:18
can get my hair done and then tomorrow I
13:20
focus in on the editing and it's that
13:22
repetition of that specific task that
13:24
becomes important to me so what you
13:26
could do is you could set aside a block
13:28
of time for your writing and then set
13:31
aside another block of time for your
13:33
social media on maybe every Monday you
13:35
could schedule out your social media for
13:37
the entire week instead of taking five
13:39
minutes here and there throughout the
13:40
weekend getting distracted throughout
13:42
the week you could also set aside 30
13:44
minutes every morning for email and
13:46
things like that but the more you begin
13:47
to set aside specific chunks of time
13:50
when you can get really deep into the
13:52
work that you're doing instead of you
13:55
know doing like I said a little bit of
13:56
this task a little bit of this one a
13:58
little bit of that one it helps so much
13:59
with your focus if you can say okay this
14:01
is my two-hour block and I'm gonna work
14:03
solely on social media on Monday on
14:06
Tuesday during that two-hour block I'm
14:08
going to work on this newsletter project
14:10
that I have going on and every Tuesday
14:12
that's what I work on and then every
14:13
Wednesday what I work on is you know
14:16
answering my emails and going in and
14:18
responding to fans comments so you could
14:20
kind of chunk out your work so you
14:22
instead of doing a little bit every day
14:23
you have these very focused productive
14:26
periods of time where you kind of
14:27
calendar blocking alright so the fourth
14:30
thing that I do that adds to success
14:32
when I'm organizing my time is that
14:34
every Sunday I sit down with my planner
14:37
and I decide what tasks I'm going to
14:40
tackle for this week so you remember how
14:43
I said I had it all figured out at the
14:44
beginning of the quarter what I'm gonna
14:46
do like I have all my tasks up on the
14:48
Kanban board I know what projects I'm
14:50
working on in that sort of thing so
14:51
every Sunday I sit down and I say okay
14:53
you know I've got this birthday party on
14:55
Saturday I've got a meeting on Tuesday
14:56
here's what time I actually have how
14:59
many projects or how many tasks can I
15:01
tackle realistically this week how many
15:04
words can I get written or am I on the
15:06
editing phase and I kind of take a look
15:08
at what I've got going on this week I
15:10
also take this time to sort of review
15:12
how last week went am I on track with my
15:15
goals how are things going in terms of
15:17
like how do I actually increased my
15:19
income at all this month you know am I
15:21
on target to clear my convoyed or am i
15:23
behind and if I'm behind what can I
15:25
throw out so that I focus on the most
15:27
things and if you're really interested
15:29
in seeing the review that I do every
15:31
week then that is inside my HP 90
15:34
planner that is a custom planner that
15:36
I've done for writers I created it
15:38
myself and it is up on Etsy and of
15:40
course it's a quarterly planner so its
15:43
q1 is what's up on its Etsy right now
15:45
and I believe it's about ten dollars
15:46
because it's a little bit on sale since
15:48
we're almost through the quarter but I
15:50
also have an undated version that you
15:52
could just print and use over and over
15:53
and over and then the q2 planner will be
15:55
going up in the next two weeks so be on
15:58
the lookout for that
15:59
but that planner is what I use and it's
16:01
what takes you through the whole review
16:03
of last week and then it gives you a
16:05
chance to so I'll pop in a little bit of
16:07
video here where you can see kind of
16:09
what I do each week but I have three
16:11
columns one for each of my tasks or each
16:14
of my projects and I decide which tasks
16:17
I'm going to conquer this week and then
16:19
I go into my weekly overview and I
16:21
schedule those out like I'll say okay if
16:23
I'm gonna be working on this newsletter
16:24
project and I'm gonna read this book and
16:26
take notes and work on my reader magnet
16:28
then I'm gonna schedule out like I'm
16:30
gonna read the rest of this book on
16:31
Monday and then I'm gonna do the reader
16:33
magnet on Tuesday or if Tuesday is my
16:35
day to do the entire newsletter project
16:38
then I'm gonna schedule out what tasks
16:39
I'm gonna get done this Tuesday in
16:41
relation to that project every Sunday I
16:43
do my review of the previous week and
16:45
then I go in and I decide what tasks I'm
16:49
going to tackle this week and I schedule
16:51
them out according to my calendar
16:52
blocking or according to my schedule for
16:55
the week and that is basically how I
16:57
organize my time there is a fifth piece
17:00
to this and it's very important and
17:02
something that should not be overlooked
17:03
and the fifth piece is that I also
Schedule Time
17:05
schedule time that I consider me time
17:08
and this is stuff for gaming I play
17:10
World of Warcraft with my husband I also
17:12
have some ps4 games that I play I spend
17:15
a lot of time with my son we read
17:16
together every night we go on walks we
17:19
live just a couple miles from the beach
17:21
so we go out to the beach when the
17:23
weather is nice at least a few times a
17:25
week I like to go shopping sometimes by
17:27
myself even if I'm just window shopping
17:29
I enjoy that like a trip out to
17:31
Michael's to go look at washi tape and
17:33
that sort of thing those sorts of things
17:35
refill my well and I also will binge
17:37
watch stuff on Netflix or here on
17:39
YouTube but I always make sure that
17:41
have time sometime usually in the
17:43
evenings for an hour or two that is just
17:45
for me to refill the well because I
17:47
often found that I was pretty much
17:50
filling up every set of like every spare
17:53
minute of free time with work because
17:55
it's so easy to feel like you're not
17:58
getting enough done because there's just
17:59
this huge massive amount of things that
18:01
we feel like we need to do so I think
18:04
that we can feel prone as authors to
18:06
feel guilty when we're doing something
18:09
that's just for fun but don't fall into
18:11
this trap because that's exactly how you
18:13
end up burned out and unable to write we
18:16
need life experiences we need something
18:19
to like refill our joy and focus on joy
18:21
we need to spend time with people that
18:22
we love we need to spend time doing
18:24
things that just are just for fun and
18:26
not for profit and not for work you know
18:29
there's always time to hustle and
18:30
sometimes we're on deadlines but in the
18:32
Monday and day today be sure to schedule
18:35
some time just for you so that you can
18:37
really relax and sort of exactly what I
18:41
said refill the well and get back to
18:43
work and really focus when it's time to
18:46
work so that is basically how I organize
18:48
my time I set my you know have a very
18:52
clear picture of what I want long-term I
18:54
set up my goals projects and tasks on a
18:56
90 day basis and like I said as soon as
18:58
this quarter is wrapping up I'm gonna
19:00
already be going through my entire
19:02
planning process to plan the next
19:04
quarter and figure out what goals I'm
19:06
gonna tackle what projects I'm going to
19:08
tackle in q2 of the year then every
19:11
Sunday I go in and I look at those task
19:13
lists and I figure out what I'm going to
19:15
do this week and then I do to the best
19:17
of my ability get those things done and
19:19
that helps me organize my time also the
19:22
calendar blocking is pretty huge if you
19:23
guys want to see a dedicated video on
19:25
how I choose themed days and how I do my
19:28
calendar blocking please comment below
19:30
and let me know because I can do a more
19:32
dedicated video on that but today I just
19:34
wanted to kind of give you an overview
19:35
if this sounds like magical to you the
19:39
idea of being able to organize your time
19:41
walk into your office or your space and
19:43
know exactly what you're doing every day
19:45
to stop feeling so overwhelmed by this
19:48
mountain of things you need to do and
19:50
really take control of your time
19:52
and your emotions when it comes to
19:54
feeling like you know what you're doing
19:56
you know that everything you're doing is
19:57
moving you forward towards your goals
19:59
then I highly encourage you to sign up
20:03
for my HP 90 bootcamp this is a class
20:05
that I developed last year because I had
HP90 Bootcamp
20:08
so many people asking me how I was
20:11
getting so much done
20:12
last year I published five books wrote a
20:14
sixth book that hasn't been published
20:15
yet I started this YouTube channel and
20:19
put out almost 80 videos I am racing a
20:22
six year old and you know of course I
20:24
managed all of those other things I give
20:26
a big speech at rwa so I got a lot done
20:28
last year and so a lot of people were
20:29
asking me how did you get it all done
20:31
and the truth is I got it all done with
20:34
record amount of time for myself and
20:37
feeling happier and more in control of
20:39
my career than I ever have and it's
20:41
really not some magical thing it's just
20:43
a matter of taking those steps that I
20:45
just took you through and if you're
20:47
interested in going through that process
20:49
with my support and what having me walk
20:52
you through exactly how to take control
20:55
of your career then sign up for my HP 90
20:58
bootcamp it has just open registration
21:00
is just opening today and I am going to
21:03
give you guys $50 off the price so it's
21:06
normally 199 dollars and you can sign up
21:09
today for 149 dollars if you click click
21:11
the link down below I will leave it in
21:13
the description box this time for the
21:15
first time I'm also going to be opening
21:17
up a payment plan for those of you that
21:19
can't quite swing 150 dollars at once so
21:22
feel free to take advantage of that
21:24
payment plan as well this is a three-day
21:26
boot camp technically it has starts with
21:28
a live kickoff call on Thursday night
21:30
where you're gonna get a big 1 hour long
21:32
pep top from me on a live video and then
21:35
the actual videos will come out late
21:37
Friday or late Thursday night so you'll
21:39
have Friday Saturday and Sunday the
21:41
course will be technically running from
21:43
March 22nd 23rd and 24th and even if you
21:46
can't attend to the course live once you
21:49
purchase it you will have access to it
21:50
forever some people have not been able
21:53
to go through the whole amount of videos
21:55
in 3 days but it's ok because once you
21:57
pay for it you have access forever so
22:00
even if it takes you 2 weeks to go
22:01
through all the content you can go
22:03
through it over and over again
22:04
so I
22:05
really I'm excited about this course a
22:07
lot of people have said it already that
22:09
has been life-changing for them and
22:11
along with the course you get access to
22:13
a Facebook group that is just from the
22:15
alumni of the course and you're going to
22:18
get weekly support from me and
22:20
accountability support from me and that
22:22
comes free with the class also you get a
22:24
free planner one of my free HP 90
22:26
digital download planners for q2 you
22:28
will get that for free as well so this
22:31
course only opens four times a year and
22:32
I'm not even sure I'm going to open it
22:34
four times this year because I do have
22:36
this baby that is coming in August so
22:38
I'm not sure if I'll be able to run a
22:39
September course this year so we'll just
22:42
have to see
22:43
so maybe only a couple times this year
22:45
this is your chance to get in I would
22:47
super love to have you if this KY type
22:49
of organising appeals to you and you
22:51

[Music]
hey everybody welcome back to
0:02
heartbreathings I am having a low energy
0:05
day and I know that for some of you who
0:09
have PCOS or chronic illness or you're
0:12
just tired or you fight anxiety or
0:14
depression sometimes we have days
0:17
sometimes more often than not depending
0:19
on the cycle that we're in in our lives
0:21
where we wake up and we just
0:24
don't feel our best I am definitely
0:27
having for lack of a better term
0:29
a PCOS flare-up today where I can feel
0:32
everything in my body is swollen I'm
0:34
having some pain and aches my eyes are
0:37
constantly watering it's typical
0:39
symptoms I'm having lots of anxiety and
0:42
there are things that I wanted to get
0:44
done today so how do you find this
0:47
balance between I need to take care of
0:50
myself and I also want to get stuff done
0:53
and keep working towards my goals so I
0:55
thought instead of doing what I plan to
0:57
do today which is more higher energy
0:58
weekly reset clean the whole house do my
1:01
planning that I would just sit down and
1:03
talk to you for a few minutes about how
1:05
I handle it when I'm low energy so let's
1:08
have a little chat foreign
1:10
[Music]
Rest Without Guilt
1:16
is if you wake up and you're not feeling
1:19
great no matter what else needs to get
1:21
done assess whether or not you would
1:24
benefit right now from rest
1:26
because rest is so vital when we're
1:30
dealing with flare-ups when we're
1:32
dealing with anxiety or difficult days
1:34
or just stress that comes out of nowhere
1:36
and trying to force ourselves to be as
1:39
productive as possible really just
1:42
avoids whatever's causing the stress or
1:44
amplifies it and makes it worse over
1:46
time
1:47
but a lot of times the act of resting
1:50
can also bring on feelings of guilt and
1:53
shame because we feel guilty that we're
1:55
not getting as much done or we feel
1:57
guilty that maybe it's the third day in
1:59
a row that we've needed rest or you feel
2:01
shame because we think I'm just being
2:03
lazy I'm not going after everything
2:04
everyone else in my house or in my life
2:06
is working harder than I am and
2:09
truthfully those feelings of guilt and
2:11
shame are useless they're less than
2:13
useless right they don't help us in any
2:16
way all they do is prevent us from
2:18
getting the needed rest that we from
2:21
getting the rest we actually need so
2:24
that we can show up better tomorrow or
2:26
next week or whenever we've gotten that
2:27
rest all it does is cause more stress
2:30
and if you're like me where this chronic
2:33
flare-up is coming from some other kind
2:36
of stress on your body or your mind it's
2:39
not going to help to just keep piling
2:40
that on even if you're laying down in
2:42
bed and taking a break if you're
2:45
mentally continuing to build to beat
2:48
yourself up you're just going to be
2:49
building up those toxins and that stress
2:51
in your system so
2:53
deep breath give yourself permission to
2:56
take a rest in my hb90 boot camp which
2:59
starts tomorrow by the way if you want
3:01
to come join us it's time to plan for Q4
3:04
I always recommend building in a lot of
3:07
buffer time and you know better than
3:09
anyone how often you need that and
3:12
there's no shame there's no guilt in
3:14
needing more rest than some other people
3:17
around you or needing more rest in this
3:19
period of your life than you did in a
3:21
previous month or a previous year or
3:23
whatever we are always going through
3:26
changes in our lives in different cycles
3:28
and if you're in a cycle where you just
3:30
need more rest it's okay to do less and
3:33
in fact if you can create a plan for
3:35
yourself where you've already planned
3:37
that you're taking 10 days off this
3:39
month or 10 days off this quarter or
3:41
whatever then you don't feel any guilt
3:43
because you know you've already planned
3:45
for that time off and so today is going
3:48
to be a lower energy day and that's okay
3:50
because I have those buffer days stacked
3:53
up waiting for me kind of like sick days
3:55
and I know that I can take them without
Eliminate, Delegate, & Revise
3:57
feeling guilt so number two is to really
4:00
eliminate or delegate or really make
4:04
some changes to your plan so that you're
4:07
only focusing on things that absolutely
4:10
have to get done by you so take a look
4:13
at your schedule or whatever is
4:15
stressing you out or you feel like needs
4:17
to get done what can you just completely
4:18
eliminate doesn't need to get done today
4:20
you can do it next week like is that
4:23
Instagram post really going to make all
4:24
that much difference probably not let's
4:27
just do it on Monday it'll be fine but
4:29
then there may be some things that
4:32
really are important to keeping things
4:34
going like you need to clean up the
4:36
kitchen the kids clothes have to get
4:37
washed because they've got school
4:39
tomorrow and they've got to have their
4:40
uniform whatever it may be there might
4:41
be some things that have to get done so
4:43
ask yourself can I delegate this to
4:45
someone else can I ask for help because
4:47
there's also no shame in asking for help
4:49
even if you need help quite often that's
4:52
what our partners are there for that's
4:54
what our friends and our family
4:55
hopefully are there for and if you don't
4:57
have anyone else maybe you can hire
4:59
someone or you can just not let the
5:01
laundry get done or just do the bare
5:04
minimum and it it's okay no matter which
5:06
of those situations you're in it's okay
5:08
to do just the oh like the things that
5:11
absolutely have to get done and not beat
5:13
ourselves up like the dishes can stay
5:15
dirty for a couple of days maybe the
5:17
uniforms need to get washed so
5:19
prioritize like what has to get done and
5:21
what has to get done by you
5:23
and if you come across something that
5:26
just needs to get done by you or you
5:27
know you're gonna feel regret or you
5:29
know that it just really was something
5:31
that was important to you then how can
5:33
you do it in the most low energy way
5:36
possible like the it's going to take the
5:38
least away from you so today for example
5:41
I had wanted to record an entire house
5:43
reset I was going to do my weekly reset
5:45
my plan with me clean up the whole house
5:48
like record the whole thing
5:50
I don't have the energy for that and
5:52
that's okay but I still wanted to have a
5:53
video up today because hb90 starts
5:56
tomorrow and I wanted to remind people
5:57
and I wanted to get out there so I just
6:00
checked in with my intuition and said
6:02
what can I use this at low energy not
6:05
feeling great sort of chronic flare-up
6:07
day to say that would be super easy and
6:10
chill so I'm just sitting down for 10 or
6:13
15 minutes to talk to you here about
6:16
how I deal with this kind of day super
6:18
super low energy low effort but I still
6:21
get the video up so eliminate it if you
6:23
can delegate it or ask for help if you
6:26
can and if not do what feels good to you
6:29
in the most low energy low stakes way
Low Energy Tasks
6:32
that you can number three is exactly
6:35
going back to that low versus high
6:36
energy is identify if you can what tasks
6:40
on your list for this upcoming week or
6:42
however long you need to rest are high
6:45
energy task versus low energy task this
6:47
is really something that you can have
6:50
figured out even on a good day so I have
6:53
an entire workbook if you're on my
6:55
newsletter list that's called the energy
6:57
audit and you can I will leave it in the
7:00
description for you below as well if
7:02
you're not on my list and you want to
7:03
sign up for that to get it for free we
7:05
have tons of resources in the
7:07
heartbreathings resource library for
7:09
free that you can download and print or
7:11
use on your iPad and one of them is an
7:13
energy audit and I go through this
7:15
process there of choosing and writing
7:18
down your high energy tasks versus your
7:20
low energy tasks so if you're somebody
7:22
who is just at a point where you're like
7:24
I need to keep moving forward I don't
7:26
want to lose my momentum I do want to
7:29
get some stuff done and I'm not
7:31
completely like out of it and I don't
7:33
need to just rest all day but I do need
7:35
to kind of take it easy because there
7:36
are going to be some days where you just
7:38
need to rest and you don't get anything
7:39
done and that's okay but some days maybe
7:42
you're like I know I can do some stuff
7:43
that's where I am today but I want to do
7:45
something more low energy so you could
7:47
scrap your plans and stay flexible but
7:50
choose something off your list that's
7:51
more low energy this could be different
7:53
for everyone like your list may look
7:55
very different from mine like for me
7:57
planning gives me energy it makes me
7:59
feel better but for some people planning
8:01
is just like exhausting to make all
8:03
those decisions for some people
8:05
answering emails is super easy and low
8:07
energy and for other people like my
8:09
husband it's like the most stressful
8:10
thing to have to answer emails and make
8:12
sure they're worded exactly the right
8:13
way so this list is very personal to you
8:16
what is a low energy task what's
8:18
something that's low hanging fruit
8:19
something you can easily get done and if
8:22
you have planned with something like the
8:23
hb90 system those tasks are going to be
8:26
up there on your kanban board or on your
8:28
list anyway like on Trello so it can be
8:30
helpful when you're making those plans
8:32
to go ahead and separate out or identify
8:35
which ones are really low energy and
8:37
which ones are high energy so that when
8:39
you wake up and you're having a bad day
8:40
you can just pick from the low energy
8:42
tasks and keep moving forward number
8:44
four is really to have some type of
Non-Negotiable Self Care
8:47
non-negotiable self-care that you always
8:50
put into your schedule so this is a
8:51
little bit more preventative and it
8:54
doesn't solve everything obviously
8:55
you're still going to have days where
8:57
you have flare-ups or anxiety or other
8:58
things but a couple of years ago I was
9:01
dealing with debilitating anxiety really
9:04
at the beginning of this year I was
9:06
dealing with some debilitating anxiety
9:08
some days where I would get out of bed
9:10
and immediately as soon as I woke up I
9:12
was having like shaking stomach aches
9:15
feeling like a pain panic attack and so
9:19
part of what I had to do like in that
9:21
moment I had to do whatever I needed to
9:22
do to deal with that for myself take
9:24
some breaks you know help myself in the
9:27
Panic of the moment but once I calmed
9:30
down and I started realizing this was
9:32
happening more often than was really
9:35
healthy for me I decided I needed to put
9:38
in some non-negotiable self-care things
9:40
and reduce my stress overall as a
9:43
preventative measure and it has
9:44
literally changed my life so if you've
9:46
been in this channel for a while you
9:48
know that one of the things I started
9:49
doing was actively getting back to a joy
9:53
of writing and that has been massively
9:56
Game Changer I cut down on the number of
9:58
courses I'm running this year I cut down
10:00
a little bit on the number of videos
10:01
that I've recorded and I have gone
10:03
really deep into
10:06
like quarter sort of romanticizing my
10:09
writing getting back to this love of it
10:11
the things that I loved about it in the
10:12
first place and sort of indulging myself
10:14
in reading books in
10:17
uh creating an office space that feels
10:21
good drinking tons more water which I
10:24
know doesn't sound like it's related to
10:26
writing but it's just those
10:28
non-negotiable self-care things that
10:30
allow me to feel and be more creative
10:32
keeping my house more tidy putting
10:35
reminders and affirmations up on my
10:37
mirror keeping like making my bed every
10:40
morning getting up at the same time
10:42
every single day establishing a
10:43
nighttime routine we got some smart
10:45
lights in our bedroom and we got one of
10:48
those Google hubs like I think it's
10:49
called a Google home hub or whatever and
10:52
it plays relaxing rain sounds but it
10:54
also I can set it up with a morning
10:56
routine now where it gradually turns on
10:58
the lights in my bedroom and I wake up
11:00
at the same time every day these kind of
11:02
things have been completely game
11:04
changing for me and it's not really a do
11:06
this today kind of thing it's a slowly
11:09
ease into these routines over time but I
11:12
do encourage you to start integrating
11:14
and thinking about some routines that
11:16
are non-negotiable so self-care
11:19
bubble baths walks meditation just
11:23
taking a little bit of that stress off
11:25
your plate therapy more water more
11:27
sunlight whatever that list looks like
11:30
for you start doing as much of that as
11:32
you're capable of on a daily basis as
11:36
often as you can start bringing these
11:37
things into your life and you're going
11:39
to start to see a big difference in the
11:40
long term and the final tip that I try
Systems For Ease
11:43
to integrate as much as possible is to
11:46
begin developing and creating systems
11:49
for ease and effortlessness in your life
11:52
so my friend Denise stuff Phil Thomas
11:55
has a book called chill and prosper
11:57
which I highly recommend all
11:59
entrepreneurs read I'm actually quoted
12:02
in this book by the way if you happen to
12:03
grab it but she talks about having a
12:07
keyless life and in that book she kind
12:09
of discusses how when she got her first
12:11
car that had keyless entry you know it's
12:13
like all the cars have it now but for a
12:15
long time you had to actually physically
12:16
put a key into the car but now almost
12:19
all cars come with keyless entry and in
12:21
fact my Tesla doesn't even have a key it
12:23
just opens from my phone which is just
12:25
so wild but you just press the button
12:28
and the car unlocks right and what she
12:31
started to understand was if she could
12:34
create as much ease in her life in all
12:38
ways in her meal prep in her business in
12:41
the way that she interacts with the kids
12:43
teachers or all of these different
12:46
things like which areas of her life
12:48
could she make keyless meaning so easy
12:51
at the touch of a button it's done for
12:53
you and of course some of this takes
12:56
money which she is a millionaire so she
12:58
has built up her life to be able to do
13:00
that but some of these things are also
13:02
somewhat easy so for me one of the
13:04
things that I do is routines so I plan
13:08
out my entire week of meals it used to
13:11
be super stressful for me to figure out
13:12
every single night for dinner what are
13:14
we gonna have what's happening the kids
13:16
are arguing all this stuff and it caused
13:17
a lot of stress in my life what I do now
13:19
is every Saturday or Sunday I sit down I
13:22
make a meal plan for the entire week and
13:24
it's often just the same things repeated
13:26
over and over on a rotation I have it
13:29
all in any list on my phone and then I
13:33
just put that grocery list into my HEB
13:36
app order the groceries and it's done
13:38
and that feels pretty darn keyless
13:40
because I have my typical Monday night
13:42
already set up I just click order
13:44
groceries dun dun dun dun dun go and
13:47
pick it up the next morning and that has
13:49
made things a lot easier than every day
13:51
looking through the pantry trying to
13:53
figure out what I'm gonna eat running to
13:55
the grocery store you know all those
13:56
kind of things that felt more chaotic
13:58
and so I have been looking pretty
14:00
consistently for how can I create that
14:03
level of ease that sort of keyless life
14:05
in all areas of my life in my business
14:08
in my relationships in my meal prep and
14:11
the way that I run my house
14:13
it's a Saturday so the kids are out
The Golden Goose
14:15
there getting ready for lunch so another
14:17
concept that she talks about in that
14:18
book that really stuck with me this is a
14:20
little bit uh Gory for a fable so just a
14:25
little bit of warning you can skip to
14:26
the time stamp on here if you don't want
14:28
to hear this because I know it might
14:30
upset children I don't know even though
14:31
it's probably a children's story but
14:33
there is a esop's fable called the
14:35
Golden Goose and it's about maybe like a
14:38
farmer and his wife who have this Goose
14:40
or sometimes it's a hen or a chicken or
14:41
something who every day lays a golden
14:44
egg like just made of pure gold and of
14:46
course that's riches right there but
14:48
they start to get greedy and they think
14:50
you know what if we just cut this
14:51
chicken open or this Goose open we could
14:54
get all the gold out of it all at once
14:56
and so they do that but of course when
14:58
they cut it open they find that it's
15:00
just like a normal Goose on the inside
15:01
and now they will never because they've
15:04
killed it have more golden eggs so sorry
15:07
for the Gory nature of that explanation
15:09
but it really stood out to me because in
15:12
our businesses is as writers
15:14
entrepreneurs sticker owners Realtors
15:16
moms like whatever it is that we're
15:18
doing we are the Golden Goose like
15:21
things don't get done the money doesn't
15:23
get made the books don't get written
15:25
without us and so if we tear ourselves
15:28
apart trying to get all the work trying
15:31
to squeeze every tiny moment of work out
15:34
of ourselves we're just going to find
15:36
that there's no more eggs left to give
15:38
there's no more gold there's no more
15:40
abundance in order for us to continue to
15:43
produce these golden eggs these books
15:45
these great creative ideas these
15:48
life-changing like works that we're
15:51
doing in our lives we need that rest
15:53
cycle to be able to rest and then
15:55
produce and rest and produce and really
15:58
one of the biggest keys to finding
16:00
success in our lives is on an individual
16:02
basis figuring out what we need to help
16:05
support us in producing our most
16:08
creative and best work and it rarely is
16:11
about pushing ourselves Beyond a level
16:13
of good health
Closing Thoughts
16:15
so that's it for today just a simple
16:17
discussion some tips that have made a
16:19
difference for me head down to the
16:21
description to grab that energy audit
16:23
workbook if you're not already on my
16:24
list if you are on my list then I've
16:27
sent you an email today with a reminder

16:35
you're taking care of yourself come join
16:37
us in the hb90 boot camp I promise you
16:39
it can be life-changing to create a plan
16:42
where you know you have buffer days
16:44
where you know you have low energy
16:45
versus high energy tasks and you've
16:48
gotta you don't have to plan every day
16:49
you just have to plan for the quarter
16:51
and now you always know and you have
16:53
Clarity on what you can get done
16:55
throughout the quarter so let's plan
16:57
together for an amazing end to 2023 I
17:01

17:11
[Music]


hello everyone and welcome back to heart
0:02
breathing's today we are going to talk
0:04
about something that has been requested
0:05
by many of you in several of the video
0:07
comments which is what in the world is
0:10
going on with that board back there and
0:12
am I using it as a story board well the
0:14
answer is actually no it is not a story
0:16
board for me but it is actually a
0:19
business planning board this is how I
0:21
plan my year how I planned my task this
0:23
is how I get everything done even though
0:25
I'm a mom to a five-year-old I'm writing
0:27
several books a year managing a
0:29
six-figure business and now I've started
0:31
this sort of second business of coaching
0:34
other authors and giving out tips and
0:35
tricks so this is how I get it all done
0:37
is with this little board back there so
0:40
I'm going to show you all how I do it so
0:42
[Music]
0:45
the key to how I'm getting everything
0:48
done is that I'm actually not getting
0:51
everything done there would be
0:52
absolutely no way that as an indie
0:55
author with I don't have a personal
0:57
assistant anymore you know I'm doing
0:59
this pretty much all by myself there
1:01
would be no way for me to get every
1:03
single thing done
1:04
because it feels like everyday there's
1:06
somebody else posting on Facebook hey
1:08
have you tried this new program have you
1:10
done this new social media why aren't
1:11
you over here on Twitter being active in
1:13
this Twitter chat and it could just go
1:15
on and on and on there's just a million
1:16
things I would love to try I would love
1:18
to be more active on Instagram and my
1:20
Facebook and trying this and doing this
1:22
with my newsletter but as you well know
1:24
if you're an entrepreneur or if you're
1:26
an author who is an indie author you
1:28
know just as well as I do that there are
1:29
so many things that pull our focus and
1:32
we could just have an endless to-do list
1:35
that we would never ever accomplish or
1:37
get done but we do need to know the most
1:41
important things in our business that
1:43
move us forward instead of doing all of
1:45
these busy work tasks that really don't
1:47
get us anywhere like I learned very
1:49
early on that like Facebook parties and
1:51
author takeovers don't really work so
1:53
well for me so when someone asks me hey
1:55
would you do this author take over on my
1:57
blog Facebook page no I don't have time
2:00
for that it doesn't mean that that blog
2:02
isn't greater that that blogger isn't
2:04
great but that hasn't worked to
2:05
translate into enough sales to make up
2:07
for the two to three hours of time that
2:08
I lose and that's something that you
2:10
begin to
2:11
over time it's like what works what
2:13
doesn't work but in order to know what
2:15
works and what doesn't work you have to
2:16
actually be getting in there and trying
2:18
the things that you most want to try the
2:20
things that are truly your priorities
2:22
and where I found that I was making a
2:24
huge mistake is that I wasn't even
2:26
really setting my own priority what I
2:28
was doing is I was just throwing
2:30
spaghetti at the wall I was like well
2:31
she's doing this so I'm gonna try it or
2:33
he said to do this so I'm gonna try that
2:34
too and I was just you know trying
2:36
everything and what would happen is at
2:39
the end of a year I would have had like
2:41
all these goals and all these things I
2:42
would have wanted to accomplish and I
2:44
would have written less books than I
2:45
meant to which let's face it writing the
2:48
books and putting the books out is the
2:49
number one things that actually makes me
2:51
money and grows my career so to ignore
2:53
that in favor of like Facebook parties
2:55
or conventions was not the smartest
2:57
thing that I could have done and I
3:00
started to understand that over time you
3:02
know I was getting less books written I
3:04
was doing less of the more important
3:06
marketing things that needed to get done
3:07
and I was really feeling super
3:11
overwhelmed because I had all these
3:13
projects that were started and very few
3:16
that were actually being completed I
3:18
knew that I had to change what I've
3:19
started doing that has really really
3:22
changed everything for me over the last
3:23
year is I am planning my year instead of
3:27
like sitting down like I used to and
3:29
trying to like in December planning out
3:31
my you know goals for the entire year
3:33
and like constantly redoing it when I
3:36
found out I was behind like every 30
3:37
days I would redo that plan what I
3:39
decided to do was to plan in quarters or
3:42
in about 90 day segments so January
3:45
February March
3:46
q1 I set three main goals and then
3:51
underneath those goals I set projects to
3:53
help me achieve those goals and then
3:55
every project has a list of tasks and if
3:58
that sounds a little bit confusing I
3:59
will walk you through it in just a
4:00
minute but I said those main goals then
4:04
I set my projects that I wanted to
4:05
complete and then I set my tasks and
4:07
everything else everything that was not
4:10
in that 90 day plan was just something I
4:14
didn't worry about for this quarter for
4:16
example I have really really badly
4:19
wouldn't been wanting to do some things
4:21
on Wattpad because I
4:23
have a lot of success there with my
4:25
beautiful demons books that are up and
4:27
I've got a lot of followers like over
4:29
2,000 almost 3,000 followers there and
4:31
I've really wanted to do something fun
4:33
to see if I could engage more people
4:35
over there to see if I could offer more
4:36
free things from my core fanbase and see
4:38
if they would enjoy reading it over
4:40
there it's just something I've wanted to
4:41
try but I did not have time in quarter
4:44
one and once I set out my plan and I set
4:46
my priorities I understood okay that's
4:49
something that's just gonna have to wait
4:50
so happily it is now in my quarter to
4:53
plan but I didn't spend any time quarter
4:55
one stressing out about that task it's
4:58
just off my plate off my shoulders and
5:01
it leads to so much less overwhelm for
5:04
me to just say I don't have to worry
5:06
about that now I'm gonna worry about
5:08
that later
5:08
so like I said I choose three main goals
5:12
now if you'll notice on the board behind
5:13
me there are four different colors of
5:16
sticky notes up there well the yellow is
5:18
my personal goals that's just totally
5:21
personal things like weight loss books I
5:23
want to read for pleasure
5:24
going to the beach saving for Disney
5:26
that kind of stuff that's not
5:27
necessarily on a 90 day plan that's just
5:29
stuff I want to remember for myself so
5:31
that's all the way on one side and those
5:34
are just part of my personal goals the
5:36
other three colors are my business goals
5:40
and this is where I am laser focus if
5:42
something does not go on this board it
5:45
does not get done it does not get
5:47
worried about I don't spend time on it
5:48
don't even think about it because
5:50
otherwise it can lead to overwhelm and
5:52
it can lead to not getting the things
5:53
done that are truly my priority it is a
5:55
problem for so many of us who are
5:57
artists and never expected that we would
6:00
actually have to become entrepreneurs
6:01
when we took on this business and you
6:05
know as I learn more about managing my
6:08
business I understand that because I'm a
6:09
free spirit
6:10
I really need to know exactly what I
6:12
want to focus on so that I can be
6:14
creative with when it comes to my art
6:16
but I can be focused when it comes to my
6:18
business if you'll notice from previous
6:21
weeks those of you who have been
6:22
watching my channel the board has been
6:24
mostly cleared because we are about to
6:26
start a new quarter quarter to is going
6:28
to be April May and June of this year
6:31
I have my three goals set out now these
6:32
are just blank ones
6:34
wanted to make sure that these sticky
6:35
notes were gonna stick up there the
6:37
colors have changed because
6:38
unfortunately I could not find the same
6:40
colors of post-it notes that I was using
6:42
before so I went by Walmart and I found
6:44
these little sticky notes cubes here's
6:47
how I go through the process I set every
6:50
quarter three main goals no more than
6:55
three it could be less if I had just one
6:57
main goal like if I was just focused on
6:59
publishing my books then I would just
7:01
focus on one main overarching goal but I
7:05
usually have three I don't ever have
7:07
more than three other than including my
7:09
personal I only have three business
7:11
goals and the reason for this is because
7:13
if you start getting four or five six
7:15
business goals that are like you know
7:17
and--but a business goal is not just
7:18
necessarily you know finish a rough
7:21
draft I'm talking about overarching
7:23
business goals and I'll walk you through
7:24
what mine are for this next quarter so
7:26
you can kind of see what I'm talking
7:27
about
7:28
these are big goals and the more you add
7:30
the more you've got on your plate and
7:31
you really will learn over time how much
7:34
you can handle in one quarter or one
7:36
segment of time okay so I set three main
7:39
goals and then once I know exactly what
7:41
those goals are I start to figure out
7:43
and think for each goal what's going to
7:45
get me to that goal
7:47
what things are going to move me in the
7:49
right direction and if I think about
7:51
something like putting a book up on
7:53
Wattpad if that task or that project
7:56
doesn't move me toward the goal that I'm
7:59
trying to achieve
8:00
then it gets X tile it becomes something
8:02
that is not a priority so I will walk
8:04
you guys through kind of how I plan or
8:07
what this looks like later but I have a
8:09
ton of these like happy planner disk
8:11
notebooks and I punched out some of my
8:14
own great paper and just started writing
8:17
out my own goals so I will show you a
8:19
close-up of this in just a minute
8:21
but the first goal for me this year and
8:25
this is my blue goal on the post-it
8:27
notes is to publish and promote both new
8:30
and backless titles to increase my
8:32
average income - and I always put a good
8:35
better and best 15,000 20,000 or 30,000
8:41
dollars a month by June 30th which is
8:43
the end of this quarter so that is my
8:46
blue goal and when
8:47
think about this goal is to publish and
8:49
promote brand new books and my backless
8:51
title books to raise my income up so
8:54
that is the goal in a nutshell and then
8:57
when I start to look at what I can do to
9:00
achieve that goal that's when I start to
9:04
put out my projects so my projects for
9:06
this goal are things like publish
9:08
sacrifice me outline and publish
9:11
deceiving darkness which is book ten in
9:13
my series outline which is Mark this is
9:16
not going to be published this quarter
9:17
but it is will a harbor book and I'd
9:19
like to have it outlined and potentially
9:22
the rough draft done paperbacks reformat
9:24
my remaining paperbacks because I have
9:27
old covers on those ads and promotions
9:30
for my backless titles and
9:32
ding-ding-ding I'm going to be posting
9:35
deaths awakening one of my backless
9:36
titles to Wattpad so those are my
9:39
projects and if something does not fall
9:41
within those projects then it does not
9:43
get done under this goal if there was
9:45
something else that I wanted to do like
9:47
for publisher promotions like I'm gonna
9:49
reach out to bloggers so I'm gonna do
9:51
this I'm going to do that it would go on
9:52
my next quarter system because I have to
9:56
stay focused within what is going to get
9:58
me to my goals this 90 days then I take
10:02
that project so for example publish
10:05
sacrificed me is project to number one
10:07
under goal number one so then I take
10:09
that project so for example publishing
10:12
sacrifice me is project number one under
10:14
goal number one of making $15,000 a
10:17
month this SEC cycle so under that I
10:21
have tasks the tasks are what gets
10:23
written I actually have that wrong I'm
10:27
actually realizing that I have those up
10:29
there wrong because the purple tasks are
10:31
my Sara Canon writing tasks but anyway
10:33
so I take each one of those tasks and I
10:36
put them on a purple sticky note so it's
10:39
not the project or the goal that goes up
10:41
on the board it's the actual task so for
10:45
example underneath sacrifice me I've got
10:47
you know finished the rough draft to
10:49
publish part one of the cereal finalize
10:52
the edits send it to betas publish part
10:55
to format my arcs and them to my arc
10:57
team create teasers and post one per
10:59
week send out my
11:00
newsletter apply for a book bub on for
11:03
two so I've got everything I need to do
11:06
to publish and promote sacrifice me goes
11:09
on one of these sticky notes and it will
11:11
go up on the board now my second goal
11:15
for this quarter is the blue ones so I
11:19
do need to switch those around increase
11:21
fan engagement on social media the blog
11:23
and my newsletter by 10% 15% or 30% so
11:27
those are my good better best goals and
11:30
underneath that I will write out the
11:32
projects that I'm going to use to get me
11:35
to that goal for this 90 days let me
11:38
know if you guys have any questions
11:39
about how I've set these things up but
11:41
hopefully you understand the structure
11:42
is I've got the main goal to increase my
11:46
fan engagement then I have the project's
11:49
underneath it like a facebook live
11:51
strategy newsletter strategy you know
11:54
different things like this then
11:55
underneath each one of those projects I
11:57
have the specific tasks that are going
11:59
under and the tasks are where you really
12:01
drill down to the minutia the small
12:03
things that need to happen on a daily
12:05
basis and having that stuff actually
12:07
written out is what really really makes
12:10
things for me and that's the things
12:12
those little minor details are the ones
12:14
that go up on the board for me and I'm
12:16
going to show you in just a minute how I
12:17
actually use those but first I'm going
12:19
to go through goal number three so goal
12:20
number three for this quarter for me is
12:23
to grow heart breathing's with quality
12:24
consistent content to a thousand
12:27
subscribers on YouTube and my newsletter
12:30
and then underneath that goal I have a
12:33
list of projects that hopefully will
12:35
help me get to that magic goal like
12:36
1,000 subscriber number so that is my
12:40
entire focus all of those things are my
12:43
entire focus for the upcoming 90 days
12:45
and if it doesn't fall into those 90-day
12:48
goals then it doesn't even follow my
12:50
shoulders if there's an emergency
12:52
situation that it's like oh my gosh I
12:54
completely forgot to do this then I will
12:56
work on it but there's other things like
12:58
I really am starting to consider getting
13:00
my books more of my books into audio
13:02
it's something I think could be a really
13:04
good moneymaker for me and it could
13:06
promote my back list but right now I
13:08
don't have time to add
13:10
to my plate so it will go on to a list
13:12
of things I'm considering doing for
13:14
quarter three but it's just such a
13:16
relief off my chest to not have to worry
13:20
about that this 90 days I know it's
13:22
important but I cannot do every single
13:24
tiny little thing the more I stay
13:26
focused the better off I'm going to be
13:28
so that is the first part of this video
13:31
for the second part of this video I'm
13:32
going to show you how I actually use the
13:34
board behind me okay so here is the
14:06
Virgen board there is almost nothing on
14:09
it you'll see that there are some yellow
14:10
stickies that I'm carrying over from
14:12
last time but this basically is just a
14:15
dry erase board that I got off of Amazon
14:19
it's really like wallpaper dry erase
14:21
board it's not like one that's on a
14:23
frame and I just cut it up exactly the
14:25
dimensions that I wanted and I printed
14:28
it up with some ribbon and a bow up here
14:32
and then I added some washi tape and
14:34
some of it is gonna be easy to see and
14:36
some will be a little bit harder but as
14:37
you can see I've got this top part here
14:40
that says master plan and then it's
14:42
numbered one two three and four and if
14:45
you can see like right here I also have
14:47
a little strip of white washi tape to
14:49
just delineate the three and four goals
14:53
here then in the middle I have a section
14:55
that says get it done and then at the
14:58
bottom it says awesome job the way I use
15:01
this board is I set my three goals that
15:06
I walked you through earlier for my
15:07
90-day plan the one two and three goals
15:10
that are over here at the top those are
15:12
my three business goals for this 90 days
15:14
and what I'm gonna do here in a minute
15:16
is I will write out all of my projects
15:18
and tasks on sticky notes of different
15:21
colors and I will put them in
15:23
to either goal number one goal two or
15:26
goal three and they will all start up
15:28
here at the top of the board then as I
15:31
begin to work on something I will move
15:33
it to this middle get-it-done section
15:36
where that will be the tasks that I'm
15:38
working on at the moment and then once a
15:41
task is completed it will move to
15:42
awesome job this is actually a board
15:46
that's called a Kanban board I think is
15:48
how you say it's K a and B a n and it is
15:51
a you know business or personal
15:53
development tool to help you manage your
15:55
projects and so I sort of adapted it to
15:58
my own 90-day plan and I will show you
16:00
how I set it up at the beginning of each
16:02
90 days okay so what I have here are all
16:05
of those tasks that I was talking about
16:07
in my color-coded system
16:09
I've got goal number one is purple two
16:12
is blue and three is pink and I've
16:14
written down all those tasks that I'm
16:16
going to complete over the next 90 days
16:18
and now I'm just going to put them up on
16:19
the board
16:23
[Music]
16:38
[Music]
16:45
this was goal number one about polishing
16:48
promoting my backless titles and this is
16:51
by far as you can tell from the number
16:53
of tasks this is where I'm going to be
16:55
spending most of my time and the reason
16:57
for that is because that's where most of
16:58
my money comes from and I know this over
17:01
the course of the past several years so
17:02
that's where I want to focus my time I
17:04
also go really granular on this so I put
17:07
like formatting every single thing
17:09
sending it to beta readers sending it to
17:11
our Creed are finishing 10,000 words
17:13
because it makes me feel better than
17:14
more things I can move down and as I
17:16
explained before this is my master plan
17:18
these are all my goals and tasks then
17:21
I've got to get it done which is this is
17:23
what I'm currently working on and then
17:24
down here awesome job is what I've
17:27
already completed so for example I've
17:29
already moved sending Part one I've
17:31
sacrificed me over here to beta readers
17:34
this is already on my getting done
17:35
because this is my next task to complete
17:37
with my second goal which is my like
17:41
Sarah Koenig marketing goal which is to
17:43
increase fan engagement I will take a
17:46
look at the beginning of every week and
17:47
say ok what thing am I going to focus on
17:49
this week and I'll move that stuff down
17:51
so probably the first thing that I'm
17:54
gonna be focusing in on is I'm going to
17:58
rebrand my newsletter
18:00
welcome tej and then I'm gonna create an
18:02
ad on Facebook targeting my fans to
18:05
increase engagement there then when it
18:07
comes to heart breathing's which is my
18:09
pink goal this is getting my subscribers
18:12
up to a thousand people I'm going to
18:14
look here and I'm gonna say okay first
18:16
thing that I need to do is to create my
18:19
April images which is for the first 30
18:22
days
18:22
and I need to write the April content
18:25
for my blog and record my April videos
18:28
so once I've got these goals and these
18:30
tasks up here I know at the beginning of
18:33
each week I can select the things that
18:34
I'm gonna focus on and work on this week
18:36
and they get moved to this second
18:38
section of the board then when
18:41
something's done like once I'm done
18:42
creating April images for the blog I
18:44
move it down here to awesome job and I
18:46
know that it's done and as this begins
18:48
to fill up over the course of the
18:50
quarter
18:51
it just really starts to make me feel
18:52
super accomplished I know exactly what
18:54
needs to be done exactly what hasn't
18:56
gotten done yet and exactly what I'm
18:58
focusing on this week which for me helps
19:00
clear out so much overwhelm because I
19:03
feel like okay if it's not in this
19:06
middle section I don't have to worry
19:07
about it this week as long as it's still
19:09
up here it's not on my plate yet and
19:12
then when as I start moving things down
19:14
I can see that okay this is exactly what
19:16
I'm focusing on and that helps me to
19:18
really like focus my time be much more
19:21
clear about where I'm spending my time
19:23
and overall it helps me get a lot more
19:24
done so this is my 90-day Kanban board
19:28
that is for my productivity for my
19:31
business okay so I'm just gonna show you
19:33
real quick how I make a principle 90 day
19:36
plan that looks really good that has the
19:38
30 60 and 90 day goals to it I just go
19:41
to Google slides and this is free it's
19:43
the way it's sort of like PowerPoint
19:44
presentation that you can start a new
19:46
presentation you could do something like
19:48
this inside of word also but I just like
19:50
the way it looks in Google slides and
19:52
you can see here that I've got a q1 90 I
19:55
plan and my q2 90-day plan so I
19:58
originally just opened my q1 and made a
20:01
copy and then I went in and Bri
20:03
organized this one so you can see up
20:07
here Sarah cannon 90-day plan and I just
20:09
formatted the slide to be
20:10
eight-and-a-half by eleven sheet of
20:12
paper in the orientation and then I
20:15
won't take you through exactly how I did
20:16
this unless you guys are interested to
20:18
see how I set it up but I just created
20:19
some tables here and then colored them
20:21
in so they look really nice and pretty
20:23
and it's kind of branded to my heart
20:25
breathing's colors but my theme for this
20:28
90 days
20:29
embracing ass-kicker sweetie and that is
20:31
just a nickname that my husband has for
20:33
me
20:34
evil sweetie is when I am being really
20:37
down on myself and ass-kicker sweetie is
20:39
when I'm kicking ass so I am going to
20:42
kick ass this 90 days and you can see
20:45
here I've got my outcome goals in this
20:47
left column so there's that to publish
20:50
and promote both the new and backless
20:51
titles to increase my average and come
20:53
to fifteen twenty or thirty thousand
20:55
dollars a month by June 30th then the
20:57
second goal increased fan engagement
20:58
across social media blog in my
21:00
newsletter and then the final goal this
21:02
quarter is to launch my new heart
21:04
breathing's website and oops I need to
21:06
change that because this is still
21:07
wording from last 90 days so I'm going
21:11
to just go in and change that to quality
21:20
content to grow my list or YouTube to 1k
21:27
1,500 or 3 K subscribers by June 30th
21:30
and all this stuff is just editable so
21:32
then I export it as a PDF then what I
21:36
have here is for each outcome goal I
21:38
have my 30-day milestone my 60-day
21:41
milestone and my 90-day milestone this
21:44
is not every single task that I have to
21:47
do over the 90 days but these are just
21:48
kind of like the bigger parts of the
21:50
projects that I want to have done so
21:53
that way like at the end of April the
21:55
first 30 days I can look and I can mark
21:57
these off if I've done them or I can see
21:59
that I am behind at the end of April I
22:01
will reevaluate this and I will check
22:03
off any of these things that I have
22:05
completed or I'll put an arrow into the
22:07
next 60 days for things that I have not
22:09
yet completed and I have those 30 60 and
22:11
90 day milestones for each one of my
22:14
three goals then beneath this I have a
22:17
little goal check card which these are
22:20
the same goals goal number one is the
22:23
same one goal number two goal number
22:25
three but these are my 30-day goals
22:28
these are the same things that you see
22:29
up here in the 30-day column it's just
22:32
now I put them all on this one sheet and
22:35
then this is my 60 day goals and my
22:37
90-day goals and I will show you in just
22:39
a minute how I use that and I just
22:42
print those out and put it up on my
22:43
bulletin board so that I can check those
22:45
off as I go if you guys would like to
22:48
get a free copy of my 90 day plan so
22:52
that you can have this as a template and
22:54
just fill it in for yourself let me know
22:56
in the comments below and I will get
22:58
that out to you so one final thing I
22:59
want to show you I can't show you the
23:01
entire bulletin board because it does
23:03
have some of my covers on it that are
23:04
not revealed but I have this one section
23:07
of my bulletin board where I have my
23:09
90-day milestones and I've made these
23:11
little printables that say 30 days 60
23:14
days 90 days then I've taken those
23:16
Google slides that you saw me create
23:18
earlier and I've printed them out cut
23:20
them to size and I have put them on my
23:23
bulletin board so that I can check these
23:25
off as I go where I know well their goal
23:27
one goal two and goal number three stand
23:30
every 30 60 and 90 days and that stays
23:33
front and center I also have print out
23:37
of that first slide there that was my
23:40
entire 90 day plan I printed out like
23:42
this and I put it beside my desk and
23:44
then I also printed out in like 75
23:46
percent size and I put it in my planner
23:50
for the 90 day okay so that concludes
23:52
this like super epic video about how I
23:55
plan my 90 days but I really hope that
23:57
you guys can see that once you set your
23:59
main goals and you figure out what your
24:01
main priorities are it really does take
24:03
a lot of the overwhelm out of the
24:05
equation because I know that over the
24:07
next 90 days starting April 1st all I
24:09
have to do is exactly what's on that
24:11
board and I'm going to move closer to my
24:14
goals it takes away a lot of the like
24:16
guessing work in terms of well what's
24:19
gonna help me increase my income what's
24:20
gonna help me increase my fan engagement
24:23
in my newsletter list and more people
24:24
clicking and opening it I have done the
24:26
work up front I have taken like I
24:29
usually take at least two or three days
24:31
of really deep thought on okay what's
24:33
worked in the past really looking at
24:36
okay people are loving the Facebook live
24:38
so I'm gonna do more of that this other
24:40
thing maybe didn't work out so well so
24:41
I'm going to do less of that or I'm
24:42
going to cut it out entirely it takes
24:44
like really looking strategically of the
24:47
things that have worked best for you in
24:48
the past and then taking the upfront
24:51
time to figure out where your goals are
24:54
where your priorities
24:55
are for the next ninety days or whatever
24:57
segments of time and then figuring out
24:59
what your game plan is then at the end
25:01
of this 90 days when most of these tasks
25:03
are done if I still haven't hit my goals
25:05
then I can reevaluate and say okay why
25:08
didn't I hit my goals is it because I
25:10
didn't finish everything that I intended
25:12
to finish or is it because these things
25:14
didn't work and if they didn't work then
25:15
I'm gonna choose something else for the
25:18
next 90 days and I continue to optimize
25:20
my process optimize my business and to
25:23
focus on the things that are the most
25:25
important for growing the business in
25:27
the way that is most important to me I
25:29
know this has been a long video but
25:31
thank you for sticking with it I hope
25:32
that this will help you also learn to
25:34
plan your own business and to help you
25:37
focus in on the things that are most
25:38
important if you enjoyed this video and
25:40
would like to see more like it let me
25:41
know down below in the comments and if
25:43
you guys would like a free template of
25:46
the Google slides 90 day plan that I
25:48
have please let me know and I will add
25:50
that as a free download in a future
25:53
video and I just really appreciate you

of you who have also suggested some
26:02
future videos and I will be taking those
26:04
requests into account and hopefully
26:06

26:07
in the coming weeks alright thanks so
26:09
much you guys
26:10
have a great weekend bye
Planning For Writers
0:00
hello everybody I am so excited to share
0:02
with you this the supplies that I have
0:04
been using to annotate my books how I'm
0:07
keeping them organized and how I'm
0:09
actually using them inside the books to
0:12
get more out of my reading and I can't
0:13
wait to share this with you so let's get
0:15
started
0:20
so today I'm going to share how I'm
0:23
annotating books on writing but you
0:26
could use this for any type of
0:28
non-fiction I also plan to use this in
0:31
some fiction as well as I learn to
0:34
continue to pick apart and study how
0:37
others have written books what parts of
0:39
them really resonate with me how like
0:41
sometimes you can hear someone explain
0:43
how something works but when you
0:45
actually see it in action you learn a
0:47
lot more from it and I want to do this
0:49
with intention and when I first started
0:52
out as a writer
0:54
gosh I guess I started really getting
0:56
serious about writing in 2007 I spent a
1:00
lot of time reading books on writing
1:03
just about everything I could get my
1:04
hands on and a lot of that has stuck
1:06
with me a lot of those books I plan to
1:09
revisit now that I have a different
1:11
perspective after writing almost 30
1:14
novels of my own but I also got so busy
1:18
with my family and YouTube and other
1:20
things that I fell off from reading a
1:23
lot of books on writing and as I have
1:25
been sort of Romancing my writing again
1:29
part of that process has been going back
1:31
to read books on writing because one of
1:35
the best ways to learn how to be a
1:37
writer is to like if you've ever heard
1:41
of the term slipstream it's basically
1:43
taking someone who's already like a
1:45
mentor who's already learned all the
1:47
things you want to learn and then using
1:49
their knowledge to move yourself along
1:51
faster and of course if all we had was
1:54
studying fiction we could eventually
1:56
figure it out and a lot of us are
1:57
already intuitively writing stories the
1:59
way that we've learned just by consuming
2:01
stories but for me something that puts
2:05
me in a slipstream or gets me
2:07
faster results in my learning is reading
2:11
books on writing and I have a huge stack
2:15
of them that I have only read a handful
2:18
of I've actually read the heroine's
2:20
journey by Gail carragher once and I'm
2:22
reading it again but I have I think I
2:25
bought maybe 20 new books on writing and
2:27
I've only read two or three of them so
2:29
I'm going to make a point during this
2:31
preptober National novel writing month
2:33
time this last quarter of the year
2:36
to really start reading more books on
2:38
writing and part of that process that
2:41
sort of romanticizes it makes it more
2:43
fun and makes it more effective is
2:45
annotating
2:47
this is something I haven't really done
2:49
since college so I've been consuming
2:52
lots of other videos on how people are
2:54
annotating both fiction and non-fiction
2:56
and I started to just dive into it so
2:59
let me show you what I'm using and how
3:01
I'm using it in these books so first
My Pen Case and Supplies
3:04
things first I just have a simple pin
3:07
case from moving option nomadic maybe
3:10
something I think I got this from
3:11
jetpens years ago I just have a little
3:13
tokidoki unicorn charm and then I got
3:16
this i got this I think just somewhere
3:18
in a little shop in downtown Dallas it's
3:20
like a little boba tea charm that I put
3:23
on here not that that matters to my
3:24
annotating but the cuter something is
3:27
the more I want to reach for it I know
3:28
it's silly but it's true so I love this
3:31
pin case it has a big wide open space
3:33
that I can keep my note cards I can keep
3:36
my highlighters and my Sharpie pens and
3:39
stuff like that in here I have all of my
3:41
page flags and then this also has a spot
3:44
that opens up here where I can keep more
3:47
page Flags some sticky notes and some
3:49
other like white out and things like
3:51
that so this stays with the book that
3:55
I'm currently working on and so if I
3:57
decide I'm going to go read I just
3:59
pulled this out what I was trying to do
4:01
when I started reading more books on
4:03
writing this year was I was trying to
4:05
just read through them and instead of
4:07
marking in the pages I was writing down
4:10
my notes in a separate notebook but I
4:13
found that that was really holding me
4:14
back because I can't go sit on my back
4:16
porch for example and have both a book
4:19
and be juggling a hardcover notebook and
4:22
a bunch of pens so it became something
4:25
that I could only use when I was sitting
4:27
down at a desk and I realized I just
4:28
don't have time to do that I need
4:30
something that I can do while I'm just
4:32
casually like hanging out with the kids
4:34
or out at a baseball game and I've got a
4:37
little bit of time or like waiting in
4:38
the line to pick the kids up from school
4:41
so I decided that I was going to
4:44
actually write in my books and I know
4:46
that this feels almost like a huge taboo
4:49
for some people so I apologize if
4:51
writing in books is not your thing but
4:53
there are other options than actually
4:55
writing in your books which I'll go over
4:57
in just a minute but I don't mind
4:59
writing in my books I haven't yet done
5:01
this with fiction but I will share what
5:03
I'm going to be doing in some of my
5:05
fiction to basically learn different
5:08
like how different authors handle
5:10
different story elements with a choice
5:12
few books but right now I'm just
5:13
starting with my non-fiction and I'm
5:15
making my way back through the heroine's
5:18
Journey which is such a great read I
5:20
highly recommend this book and let me
5:22
know in the comments if you guys would
5:23
like to see a video for nanowrimo or
5:26
coming up in preptober
5:28
on this channel about what I consider my
5:31
favorite must read books on writing
5:34
novels because I definitely have a list
5:36
so here's what I've been doing I have in
5:41
terms of supplies I have these simple
5:44
page Flags I know I'm sorry for the
5:46
glare here I'm going to just kind of
5:47
move that book so it doesn't get so bad
5:49
these I got from Amazon and
5:52
I have basically two sets of them so I
5:55
have these simple ones and then I also
5:58
have this set and these I have been
6:01
using in my actual plotting notebook
6:03
which is this notebook here
6:06
and you can see I use I have page Flags
6:10
everywhere in my house right now I feel
6:12
like so I've been using these in my
6:15
plotting so you can kind of see some of
6:18
these Pages here and I like this set
6:20
because I love to make sure that
6:24
whatever I use for color coordination
6:26
basically has a matching pin and it's
6:30
easy to find matching Post-its for it
6:32
because when I choose color schemes like
6:35
something more like this I find it very
6:37
difficult to find like all these
6:39
different gradients of blue but it's
6:40
easy enough to Find Post-its and pins
6:43
that are has a green one a yellow one an
6:45
orange one a red one a blue one a purple
6:47
one a green one like that's pretty easy
6:49
so I choose an easy to find color
6:52
palette so I know I can always find
6:54
highlighters pens and other supplies
6:56
that match my color palette
6:58
so I'm using that again in theory here
7:01
in my annotating supplies and I actually
7:04
have
7:07
I have an example here because I took
7:09
this notebook and put and put them in
7:11
here so I've been just kind of using
7:14
this one up but this is the one that I'm
7:17
planning to use in my annotating and I'm
7:21
not using all of these different colors
7:22
because these two are kind of similar in
7:25
shade so what I'm using is this top
7:28
purple one blue green yellow orange pink
7:31
so I'm not really using the second
7:33
purple one but I'm using all the others
7:35
I'll find another use for this like in
7:37
my plotting besides it's always the
7:39
purple one that goes first because
7:41
that's usually my heroine's color so
7:44
then I started looking on Amazon to see
7:46
if I could find highlighters that looked
7:49
similar in terms of color scheme because
7:53
sometimes you get highlighters and
7:54
they're too neon or they're too mild or
7:57
they're too dark
7:59
and I wanted to find one pack of colors
8:01
that I felt like I could match with one
8:03
pack of sticky notes and I actually like
8:05
it's ridiculous kind of how much time I
8:07
spent doing this because the matching is
8:10
important to me and so I went even into
8:13
people's comments where they had done
8:14
color swatches and even though these
8:16
look more pastel I knew from the color
8:19
swatches that they actually would match
8:21
pretty well so if you want to see those
8:24
swatches it's these page flags from
8:26
Amazon I'll link these down below and
8:29
then it's these
8:31
zayer highlighter that are macaron color
8:34
these are the ones that I got and it the
8:37
colors match
8:39
I mean literally almost perfectly the
8:41
only one that's off I would say is the
8:43
blue looks kind of more green but I
8:47
think it's good enough
8:48
for me
8:49
so then I went through and I looked for
8:52
these are off Brands so this is like van
8:54
pad or something these are not Post-it
8:57
notes now if you're doing a kanban board
8:59
like I do with my hb90 system highly
9:01
recommend that you get the actual
9:02
Post-it brand but
9:04
for purposes of just putting things into
9:07
books when you're not going to expect
9:09
them to like stick on a wall or
9:11
something these are perfectly fine and I
9:13
was able to find a pack of sticky notes
9:16
that had basically the same color so
9:18
you've got the purple the blue green
9:20
yellow orange and pink so this turned
9:23
out perfectly I will link all these
9:25
supplies none of them are very expensive
9:27
which is nice also so I have
9:30
the page Flags to basically
9:34
Mark any pages that I find something
9:37
that I want to call out then I have the
9:40
highlighter for when I want to actually
9:42
highlight an item or a section to draw
9:45
attention to it
9:47
then I have the sticky notes for if I
9:50
want to expand on my thoughts but I
9:52
don't really have enough room inside the
9:54
actual book now sometimes I have been
9:56
writing like a little exclamation point
9:58
or something like that but for the most
10:00
part I don't have like a ton of room
10:03
inside the book to write long notes
10:05
about my thoughts so I will use these
10:08
page flags that coordinate with the or
10:10
these sticky notes that coordinate with
10:11
the page Flags to write more detailed
10:13
notes so these are the main supplies
10:16
that I've been using now in this same
10:19
little
10:21
case here that I feel like I've had this
10:23
case for so many years it's even got
10:25
like pen marks in it because I've had it
10:27
for so long probably 10 years but I have
10:30
a Sharpie this is like a fine point
10:32
permanent marker Sharpie because these
10:35
will write on page Flags if you try to
10:37
take just like a gel pen and write on
10:39
the page Flags it's gonna smear like
10:41
crazy but if you use a Sharpie or
10:44
something like a lumo color or a dry
10:46
erase marker they'll write on top of the
10:49
page Flags just fine I also like to keep
10:52
just a regular gel pen in here for
10:55
writing in the margins I like sometimes
10:58
when I have like a particularly
10:59
interesting thing that I want to look up
11:01
I will underline it as well so I like to
11:04
have a black pen I have white out here
11:07
although I haven't needed to use it but
11:09
it's in there just in case but this is
11:12
really the core of the items that I have
11:14
page Flags sticky notes highlighters and
11:18
Sharpie and a regular pen now what if
11:21
you don't want to write in your book so
11:24
I do have some example let me pull this
11:27
out over here
Alternatives To Writing In The Book
11:29
so
11:30
you can actually get clear sticky notes
11:33
on Amazon so if you just can't bring
11:36
yourself to actually write in a book
11:39
that's fine especially if you want to
11:41
like resell it or whatever like I tend
11:43
to hold on to all of my books on writing
11:45
well all my books in general so what you
11:48
could do is you could just place this
11:52
over the top so that you're not actually
11:54
writing in the book and then you can use
11:57
this Sharpie or you could use colorful
11:59
Sharpies now highlighter is going to
12:02
just rub off on this type of plastic but
12:06
you could underline if you wanted to
12:08
excuse me so you could do this and
12:11
there's lots of colors of these Sharpie
12:12
pens and you could leave likely yourself
12:14
a little note here if you wanted to like
12:16
why did she do that you know or whatever
12:19
um
12:20
and you could write in it another option
12:23
is if you wanted to you could use a
12:26
combination of these page flags that are
12:29
colorful and the clear ones so
12:33
you could Mark your page but you could
12:35
also use these as highlighters basically
12:37
so you could go in with your green try
12:41
to just get one and you could just
12:43
highlight this with
12:45
the green
12:46
and if you don't like obviously this
12:49
isn't going to take up the entire width
12:51
of this but if you just wanted to make
12:52
sure you were highlighting a certain
12:54
section you could put this here and then
12:56
you could put the clear one underneath
12:59
it and you could underline the portions
13:01
that you wanted to keep and then you
13:03
could still put the green tab on the
13:05
side so there are ways to get around it
13:08
if you don't want to actually Mark in
13:10
your book now what am I actually marking
13:14
down let's talk about that
My Annotating Key
13:16
so I spent a little bit of time thinking
13:18
about what did I want to do to create as
13:22
a key ideally I would love to find my
13:25
own system and use the same key
13:27
throughout all of my books on writing so
13:30
that I can always say oh if there's a
13:31
definition then it's always going to be
13:33
green or if there's a key idea or a list
13:36
or something that's researched I know
13:38
what color to look for but I figure I'm
13:40
going to give myself a little bit of
13:41
time to develop that system because I'm
13:43
going to use it and then I'm going to
13:44
figure things out but I'm going to mark
13:47
my key at the beginning with the
13:49
highlighters I started out with purple
13:51
as a quote to remember
13:54
but in this book I didn't really have I
13:57
realized like quote to remember became
13:59
really key ideas so for this particular
14:02
book I changed purple to the when she
14:05
explains the differences between the
14:06
hero's journey and the heroine's journey
14:08
so I don't know how this will translate
14:10
to other books like the next book that
14:12
I'm planning to use this on is wired
14:14
price but wired for Story by Lisa cron I
14:17
loved her bookstorey genius so I'm
14:19
excited to read this as well and so it
14:23
purple is probably going to be something
14:24
different and I'll develop that as I go
14:26
but for now it's something specific to
14:29
the book's content which is the
14:31
difference between here on heroine's
14:33
Journey green is all the definitions so
14:36
when she defines a concept like the
14:38
heroine's journey what does it mean that
14:40
is a definition and so I have it in
14:43
green
14:44
so let me show you an example of that a
14:46
definition is here she's got a section
14:48
on writing terms and she says what is a
14:50
beat so beats form the component parts
14:53
of a story structure so I know that this
14:55
is one of the writing terms I wanted to
14:58
remember but really this entire section
15:00
so I went back and just highlighted this
15:02
is a series of terms right so it's all
15:05
definitions but this was one that I
15:07
really liked the way she explained it
15:09
all of the blue ones are examples or
15:11
references to other things so examples
15:14
of the heroine's journey so she goes
15:17
through Demeter's story I've got a blue
15:19
one here this is isis's story there's a
15:22
few more that she goes through like the
15:25
myth here or
15:27
um here she talks about Wonder Woman is
15:29
an example of the hero's journey and
15:31
even though Wonder Woman is gendered as
15:34
a woman it's still a hero's journey and
15:36
not a heroine's journey so it's really
15:38
interesting so I highlighted the
15:40
examples or references that I might want
15:42
to refer back to or
15:44
um you know just remember from this key
15:47
ideas and lists so there's a lot of
15:50
these here and I'm sometimes I'm like
15:52
maybe I don't want to use yellow for
15:55
this because it's not my favorite color
15:56
but like I said we might adjust so for
15:59
example here's a list of the heroine's
16:01
journey basic beats and I also have a
16:05
yellow page flag on the heroes Journey
16:07
basic beads and so if I ever want to
16:10
remember them I know that I can find
16:12
them in a Yellow Page flag
16:15
orange is further research so whenever
16:17
she mentions something like uh myth or
16:21
another book on writing or here she says
16:24
check out the concept of this or
16:27
um the hero with a thousand faces which
16:29
is I have you know I've looked into and
16:31
I have this book a fire in the mind
16:33
talking about the biography of Joseph
16:35
Campbell but I haven't read it yet so
16:37
that's a reference that's something like
16:38
another book that she references that I
16:40
would like to research more and then I
16:42
wasn't sure what I was going to use this
16:44
pink for but as I began to read this it
16:46
became very clear to me that I wanted to
16:48
Mark places where I just really loved
16:51
Gail's Voice or she made me laugh or she
16:54
said something really interesting or she
16:56
said something that I have agreed with
16:57
or I was like yes yes yes so I just
17:00
marked it as I love this so an example
17:03
of that is
17:07
well it's just funny I don't want to
17:09
show that as an example
17:11
oh my gosh but it was so funny
17:13
um so here for example she says these
17:17
narrative elements are tools of clarity
17:19
like the rules of grammar and similarly
17:21
it's best to know the rules before you
17:23
break them and I say this all the time
17:25
about story structure is you know people
17:27
will say I don't want to learn how to
17:29
plot or I don't want to learn story
17:30
structure because it's going to keep me
17:32
in a box but I always say like
17:34
if you know the rules then you know how
17:37
to break them but if you don't know the
17:39
rules at all you're just like throwing
17:41
spaghetti at a wall and so I think it
17:42
gives you power and here she echoed what
17:45
I feel like giving you Clarity it's just
17:48
more tools you got to know the rules and
17:49
then you can play with them so I was
17:51
like I love this I marked it there's a
17:53
lot of those pink pink flags so I'm
Table of Contents
17:55
doing this I am also going in and making
17:59
my own table of contents of key Concepts
18:03
here in the front of the book now this
18:05
is something that I cannot remember now
18:07
the name of the guy that I learned this
18:09
from but it was on Thiago Forte's
18:11
YouTube channel so I will link that and
18:13
his website down below where he was
18:16
talking about when he reads books one of
18:18
the ways that he gets the most out of it
18:19
is he will underline or go through and
18:22
annotate his books but also even though
18:25
you have a table of contents in the
18:27
front that is just giving you chapters
18:30
but he goes in and he makes his own
18:32
table of contents so here I've got uh
18:34
definition of the heroin heroine's
18:36
Journey five elements of a hero versus
18:38
heroine terms and definitions the hero's
18:41
journey beats and the heroine's journey
18:42
beats so that I know these are the key
18:44
Concepts I want to keep coming back to
18:46
and I have them not just tagged or
18:48
flagged but I also have them in my own
18:51
little table of contents here now what
18:53
he says he also does is when the book is
18:55
finished he will go through into this
18:57
back flap and he will write down his key
19:00
takeaways in his own words from the book
19:02
so I'm excited to use that as well and I
19:04
love that some of these books have
19:06
multiple pages of Blank Space here for
19:09
me to use so that is how I am using my
19:12
annotating
19:14
and it's helping me absorb the material
19:16
faster it's helping me learn and
19:18
remember and it's also making it easier
19:21
when I need to come back and reference
19:23
some of this now what I also plan to do
19:25
is after I've finished reading a book I
19:28
want to go through to the key ideas and
19:31
Concepts this Yellow Page flag and I
19:34
want to add those key ideas or
19:37
definitions and some of these main
19:38
points that I have flagged and put them
19:40
into my reading Journal so this is where
19:42
my actual notebook that I had started
19:44
before will still become useful for me
19:46
but I don't have to fill it out as I'm
19:48
reading which really was slowing me down
19:50
instead now I will fill it out once the
19:52
book is done and I'll go through and
19:54
pick out the page flags that I thought
19:55
were most important and be able to
19:57
distill that down into some major points
20:00
in the book so that is what I'm doing
20:03
I'm reading the heroine's journey next
20:05
is wired for Story by Lisa cron and I'm
20:07
going to also revisit pep talks for
20:10
writers by my friend Grant Faulkner who
20:12
is the executive director of nanowrimo
20:15
this is really good and you can see I
20:17
had started years ago when this first
20:18
came out to sort of Mark my favorite
20:20
sections but this is just full of pep
20:23
talks ideas how to get unstuck and
20:26
things like that so I wanted to go back
20:27
through it and these are really short
20:29
reads just a few pages each so if you
20:32
started now you could finish this even
20:34
if you just read one tiny little chapter
20:35
or a couple pages every day before Nano
20:38
I will link these below but again if you
20:40
would like to see
Final Thoughts
20:42
a more in-depth video on how I'm
20:44

20:51

[Music]
21:45
thank you
everybody I am back for another video
0:06
and today I'm going to be doing my first
0:09
plan with me this is going to be the
0:12
month of March and I'll just show you
0:13
quickly how I go through the planning
0:16
process when I'm setting up for the
0:18
month to come so I did a video earlier
0:22
about my hobo Nietzsche planner that is
0:24
inside my chic Sparrow a5 traveler's
0:27
notebook so I will link that for you
0:30
down below if you'd like to see it but
0:33
I'm going to basically just open this up
0:35
and go straight to the back here where I
0:38
have my hope and Nietzsche and I did
0:40
actually have someone asking me about
0:42
the covers like where did I find
0:45
notebooks like this for my hobo
0:47
Nietzsche or for my travelers notebook
0:48
that were covered and I'll just quickly
0:51
mention that I bought just very plain
0:54
notebooks you can actually see them when
0:56
I pull it apart from Goulet pins and I
0:59
covered them in scrapbook paper so if
1:01
you if you're interested in seeing kind
1:02
of how I did that and how I made these
1:04
dashboards for the planner I can show
1:06
you that another time but just so you
1:08
know that's how I made the inserts for
1:10
my planner and then the hobo Nietzsche
1:12
has just stucked in to the secretarial
1:15
pocket in the back of the a5 travelers
1:18
notebook but I'm going to move this to
1:20
the side because I'm just going to be
1:23
working inside the hobo Nietzsche today
1:25
to do my plan with me so the first thing
1:28
that I do is I open up to this index
1:30
page in the beginning here and I take
1:35
these rows here for each month and this
1:39
is where I kind of keep track of my word
1:41
count for the month and any kind of
1:44
little things that I want to remember or
1:45
instead of doing a full-blown habit
1:47
tracker like a lot of people do with
1:49
their bullet journals I just do this one
1:52
page and I never could keep up with a
1:56
lot of the work that goes into a bullet
1:59
journal personally I love them and
2:01
they're beautiful to look at but it's
2:02
just was too much work for me so I have
2:06
kind of found a way to marry the two
2:09
styles so I just right over the top of
2:12
that three I'm ready March
2:13
and then I color it in with a pretty
2:17
color and now I get started so up here
2:22
at the top I have three little pieces or
2:25
three little spaces here to write down
2:27
my main goals for the month and my main
2:30
goals for the month of March are that I
2:34
am going to finish sacrifice me which is
2:37
the current book that I'm working on so
2:39
I just write that here so I can check it
2:41
off hopefully by the end of the month
2:44
and then second I want to continue
2:48
working on heart breathing's which is
2:50
you know this channel that you're
2:52
watching now and I have a blog that goes
2:54
along with it and I want to finish my
2:58
self-publishing course so that will be a
3:02
course that I'll be launching at the end
3:04
of March to hopefully teach some of you
3:08
that are interested in learning the
3:10
process of how to self publish it's
3:12
going to be basically everything that
3:14
you need to know from you know planning
3:16
your series and coming up with your
3:18
strategy of what you're going to publish
3:19
all the way through how to upload how to
3:21
market how to get cover art and
3:23
everything else so it's going to be kind
3:24
of self publishing like crash course or
3:27
a boot camp there I don't have a name
3:28
for it or an exact date but I'm hoping
3:30
to have it finished by the end of March
3:32
so that I can start with beta so those
3:34
are my my main things so I can actually
3:36
go back to February 2 and I had launched
3:41
the blog insight which I did so I can
3:42
check that off record and began my
3:45
YouTube channel
3:45
yeah I did that and then write
3:47
sacrificed me part 1 which I also did
3:50
complete so I got all of my main goals
3:51
done for the month of February and you
3:55
can see here this is where I was doing
3:56
my habit tracking I'll just kind of pull
3:58
it up here hopefully it'll focus well
4:00
but I was doing don't break the chain
4:03
bright lines which is how I eat
4:04
professional development and blog work
4:06
were the things that I'm tracking and
4:08
I'm going to track the same things this
4:10
month so I'm just going to go ahead and
4:11
write them in on the side here
4:19
okay so every day that I do those things
4:22
I go through and I make just these
4:25
little pretty hashtag kind of looks so
4:27
that I can kind of see at a glance what
4:29
I did well that's basically all I fill
4:31
out just in the beginning I make sure
4:33
that I write down those main three goals
4:35
and what I'm going to be tracking and
4:37
then this middle bar is where I'll write
4:39
in and calculate my word count for each
4:42
week of the month so I don't really fill
4:44
a lot of this in until you know as the
4:46
month goes by but I do set that up then
4:50
I have my monthly tracker and this is
4:55
what I'm mostly going to be working on
4:56
today okay so this is the month of March
4:58
and what I've done so far is just a few
5:02
of the months here I've already written
5:04
out things that I know I have coming up
5:06
and I might cover them with something
5:08
prettier but for example I've got
5:11
there's a Business School by Marie
5:13
Forleo that's called b-school I actually
5:16
did this back in 2014 and it was amazing
5:21
and one of the cool things about
5:23
b-school is that once you've paid for it
5:25
once you can take it again and now that
5:27
I've kind of started the second business
5:28
that I'm going to be doing courses I
5:30
want to take it again so it's starting
5:33
March 5th so that's kind of already on
5:36
my schedule I wrote out what weeks are
5:38
going to be going on with that I've got
5:40
a parent-teacher conference week and
5:42
some other things for another group that
5:43
I'm in called freshly implemented that I
5:45
already put into the schedule so just as
5:48
things come up I will write them in here
5:51
and then I'll make them hopefully look a
5:53
little bit prettier as I go okay so now
5:55
I'm just going to go ahead and set up
5:56
some pretty things I set up already my
6:00
color scheme for the month so one of the
6:02
things I do is I just go ahead and sort
6:04
of decide what colors I'm going to be
6:06
using so if you can see here I'm going
6:08
to be using grey sort of a teal or mint
6:12
green and pink this month so I grabbed
6:14
some washi tapes from my collection that
6:16
matched that I also have my scissors
6:19
here with me a few pins I've been using
6:21
this pilot drawing pin lately I just got
6:24
it in from jetpens and I love it so I'm
6:26
going to be using that I also have the
6:29
happy planner girl collection the goal
6:31
getter
6:32
this is the mini sticker book because I
6:34
find that the mini stickers are gonna
6:35
fit a little bit better into the small
6:37
boxes here of the hope and Ichi but you
6:39
can see that's why I drew my color
6:40
palette from is this sticker book and
6:43
unfortunately I don't think these are
6:44
available any longer because they were a
6:47
limited edition then in a dish in
6:49
addition to that I made some of my own
6:52
stickers in the same sort of color
6:55
palette as I'm gonna be using these are
6:59
from Aaron Bradley designs on Etsy and I
7:03
will link her shop down below but I just
7:05
bought the graphics and then what I do
7:07
is I set up the things that I want to
7:09
use like all of the graphics and I've
7:11
cut them out with my Cricut just on like
7:14
Avery mailing the like sticky mailing
7:19
paper full sheets and then I cut them
7:21
out myself but you could always just buy
7:24
stickers if you wanted to and then I
7:25
have a few other little boxes that I'm
7:27
not sure if I'm going to use those or
7:29
not so I'm going to get started and just
7:32
make this a little bit pretty and
7:34
decorate the base line
7:38
[Music]
7:53
[Music]
8:10
now that I've added some washi tape I
8:13
will just note you don't have to add
8:14
washi tape and make things pretty I just
8:16
find that the prettier things are for me
8:18
like the more I like looking at them the
8:20
more I'm actually likely to look at it
8:24
and play with it and plan with it
8:26
instead of just leaving it and never
8:30
looking at it I've had planners in the
8:31
past where I just did not I would
8:35
decorate them but I wasn't really happy
8:38
with how they looked or I didn't
8:39
decorate them and then it was just like
8:41
I never looked at it so now that I've
8:43
found kind of a way that I enjoy
8:45
decorating I find that I spend more time
8:48
actually looking at it and making it
8:51
useful that's just me some of you may
8:53
not need that at all but I do like it so
8:55
I'm just going to deal with some of the
8:57
things that I already have on here I'm
8:59
not going to mess with this b-school
9:00
thing but some of these others I kind of
9:02
wrote in kind of sloppy so I'm going to
9:05
cover those up with other stickers so on
9:13
the 22nd I have 11 a.m. power hour and 2
9:16
to 4 open studio and I'm just going to
9:19
write that in here
9:30
one thing about these these Avery type
9:34
stickers where I'm using them is I
9:36
didn't place it totally perfectly and
9:38
now you can kind of see parts of this
9:39
over here but you can't really lift
9:41
these up a lot of the stickers you buy
9:43
from the shops on Etsy you can lift them
9:45
up and move them and I think a lot of
9:47
the happy planner ones are like that too
9:49
but you can't do that with these so you
9:52
place them once and then you hope for
9:53
the best
9:54
alright so now I'm just kind of looking
9:56
for another sticker that I can place
9:59
here on the side so I'm going to take
10:00
this long to do sticker and I'm going to
10:03
put it right here at the top where I'll
10:09
write in some of my to do's then I'm
10:12
also going to grab this little laptop
10:14
sticker here and I'm going to put it
10:16
right here
10:24
[Music]
10:26
I'm gonna be working on season two of
10:29
sacrifice me part two so I've written
10:32
that there so I know and I'm gonna write
10:34
out my goal for the month I always find
10:36
that it's hard for me to pre-plan in
10:39
terms of well what I did for years was I
10:42
tried to actually plan my entire year
10:44
out like oh I'm gonna write this many
10:46
warrants this month and this many words
10:47
and I tried to plan out my entire
10:49
publishing schedule and it got way too
10:51
overwhelming so I stopped doing that and
10:53
what I do instead is I just take it one
10:55
month at a time so my goal for this
10:57
month is to write at least 60,000 words
11:01
and having that goal front and center
11:05
for me here kind of just reminds me that
11:07
this is what I'm gonna try to do now I'm
11:10
down here at the bottom I will write out
11:12
my actual like word count and everything
11:15
as I get it
11:16
another thing that I do is I have these
11:20
three goal sheets and I set this up at
11:23
the beginning of every 90 days and I
11:25
won't really go into everything but if
11:27
you guys are interested in seeing kind
11:28
of how I plan all this I can show you
11:31
later but what I do is I plan in 90 days
11:37
so quarter one of this year is my first
11:39
90 days then what I do is I break that
11:42
90 days down into 30-day goals 60-day
11:45
goals and 90-day goals and I have these
11:47
kind of milestones that I want to hit so
11:50
that I can get to my overall 90-day goal
11:52
it sounds more complicated than it is
11:55
but these are my 30-day goals and you
11:58
can see some of the stuff that I got
11:59
done some of the stuff I still need to
12:03
mark off that I did so I'm actually
12:06
gonna grab a thicker pen so this was in
12:15
my first 30 day goal so all of this
12:17
stuff should have been done by the end
12:18
of January but it wasn't because things
12:21
don't always go like that but I did end
12:23
up getting the 10,000 words done I did
12:25
outline the plot for sacrifice me too
12:28
goal number two has to do with my author
12:31
marketing stuff and I did not get all of
12:35
my newsletter stuff done
12:37
so I'm gonna leave that one free I did
12:40
finalize my web design and launched my
12:42
site and I did write content for January
12:45
and February posts I didn't actually
12:46
launch it in January so that still
12:48
counts so I've got just one thing kind
12:50
of lingering from that thirty days then
12:52
this is the sixty day so this should be
12:54
everything that was done by the end of
12:56
February and it didn't completely all
13:00
get done but I'm gonna go ahead and look
13:03
at what did get done so I still need to
13:05
format my back list in paperback I need
13:09
to set up my promo for sacrifice me one
13:11
I haven't done my cover reveal and I
13:13
haven't finished the draft so a lot of
13:15
that is still ongoing
13:16
I did start posting I have not written
13:20
all my content for March
13:22
I've not outlined the course or begin
13:24
recording it and I haven't done all of
13:30
this stuff here so I've got quite a bit
13:32
of things left to go so I'm gonna write
13:34
some of that here on on this sheet for
13:36
my monthly so let me see what I've
13:40
gotten done out of this any of it
13:45
so this will be hopefully stuff that
13:48
will be done so what I do is I take
13:50
these two sheets that kind of live on my
13:51
bulletin board behind me and I use them
13:54
to write down like my to do's and my big
13:56
goals for the month and I kind of use
13:58
that as my guiding post so to speak so
14:02
over here in the to-do section I'm gonna
14:04
focus on the things that I think I can
14:06
really get done now I have yet to hit in
14:08
ninety days where I finished everything
14:10
on my list cuz I tend to like want to do
14:12
more than what I actually can do and I
14:15
think that's actually pretty common for
14:16
a lot of us but that's okay I don't beat
14:19
myself up over it
14:22
[Music]
14:38
[Music]
14:50
so those are my like main goals
14:53
introduced that I want to hit by the end
14:54
of the month and then I have my goal for
14:57
how many words I want to write now what
14:59
I do is I just basically go through and
15:01
fill in anything else that I know I have
15:04
for the month so on the 26th I have a
15:08
speed masterminding signup and I don't
15:10
really want to cover that up but I do
15:12
want to remember it and draw attention
15:15
to it so I'm just going to take this
15:17
little gray flag here and I'm going to
15:20
point it down toward that so that I know
15:22
I've got something coming up there I'm
15:25
also going to I have these little coffee
15:29
cups they're teeny tiny but every
15:33
Wednesday I've been going to Barnes &
15:38
Noble here locally to meet up with some
15:41
local writers that I met at NaNoWriMo so
15:44
actually I can't do it that week so I'm
15:46
going to write it here and I put it here
15:58
so I'm Iranian those appointments
16:01
Barnes and Noble and the reason that I
16:02
can't do it this week is because my
16:05
friend Karen is coming to visit so I
16:08
want to mark that as well so I think
16:10
what I'm going to do is I'm going to use
16:11
this green washi and I'm actually going
16:17
to snip off a piece of that because it's
16:21
kind of wrinkled and I'm going to mark
16:29
she's actually coming on Monday but I'm
16:31
going to mark off Tuesday I'll just let
16:36
it cover the crease there Wednesday
16:38
Thursday and Friday because we are going
16:41
to be going on another writing retreat
16:43
and we're going to go to Hilton Head to
16:46
write so I'm going to mark that here and
16:48
then I'm going to write it down
16:58
now I'm gonna look at anything else I
16:59
know that I have parent-teacher
17:00
conference coming up this week but I
17:03
don't know what day because they haven't
17:04
had sign ups yes so I've got to leave
17:06
that blank but I also have another
17:08
standing meeting every Thursday with my
17:12
accountability partner so I'm just going
17:15
to use these little reminder stickers
17:19
from this happy planner goal getter okay
17:44
so I've got that meeting marked down
17:47
then just another thing that I've been
17:50
trying to remember is that every Monday
17:54
in this group that I'm in called freshly
17:56
implemented we write down we in it we
17:58
have a Facebook group where we put in
17:59
what our goals are for the week and then
18:01
on Friday Saturday or Sunday we go in
18:03
and we tell them how we did for the week
18:06
so I always remember to put my goals in
18:08
but what I don't always remember is to
18:12
tell them how I did
18:16
[Music]
18:28
okay so it's starting to fill up a
18:30
little bit the other thing is now that
18:33
I've got this blog going I need to
18:35
remember every time I need to post and
18:39
everything like that so I am going to
18:42
put these pink circles on the Mondays
18:46
because I'm going to be posting
18:48
something to my blog every Monday then
19:01
I'm going to be posting a new video so
19:03
you can see I have these tiny little
19:07
video camera stickers I'm going to be
19:11
posting a video every Wednesday and
19:14
every Saturday
19:17
[Music]
19:27
so those will remind me of the posts and
19:31
I don't have my list with me of every
19:35
little topic that I'm going to be
19:36
covering so I'm not gonna fill that out
19:38
but what I do what I will do later is
19:40
I'll just go through with my pin and
19:42
I'll write down something to remind me
19:44
of exactly which post is going up when
19:46
because sometimes I'll record I plan to
19:49
record them kind of in a batch like do a
19:51
lot on one day and then I'll post them
19:53
later so I'll just come back in and fill
19:55
that out later but that is pretty much
19:58
everything that I know I have for the
20:01
month now I also do plan to write every
20:06
single day that I can write so I do when
20:09
I go through and I do my weekly spreads
20:11
I use these little pencils to say my
20:13
writing time but I don't want to go on
20:16
every single day of my monthly spread
20:18
because it would start to get really
20:19
cluttered if I put in exactly when I was
20:22
planning to write but I am gonna
20:23
actually take this little clipboard here
20:25
and I'm gonna pop it down here to just
20:28
kind of make this a little bit cuter and
20:32
I'll put my final word count down there
20:34
when I'm done and then I'm just gonna
20:36
look through so I'm just gonna pull this
20:39
one here because I like the way it looks
20:40
I'm gonna put it right here work like a
20:42
boss okay so Friday's are also going to
20:49
be a day that I'm going to start doing a
20:51
live video in my Facebook group so I see
20:55
these little stars I was just kind of
20:56
looking through I think I'm going to use
20:58
these stars to put this little note here
21:06
[Music]
21:16
okay so I'm gonna be doing a Facebook
21:19
live in my either my Facebook group or
21:21
on my Facebook page for my second and
21:23
author career on Friday night so I'm not
21:25
sure if I'm going to do one that night
21:26
because I'm gonna be gone that week so
21:28
I'm just gonna leave it blank and I'll
21:29
decide later
21:31
and then the other thing I forgot to put
21:34
on here was I'm going to be sending out
21:36
a newsletter for heart breathing's once
21:40
a week so I'm going to take these tiny
21:42
little little mail envelopes and I'm
21:46
gonna put that up here too
21:53
I'm also going to be doing a cover
21:56
reveal and release day announcement for
21:59
sacrificed me part 1 and I'm not exactly
22:02
sure which day I'm gonna do that on so I
22:05
have these stickers that I won't really
22:09
show you too much but I have these
22:11
stickers that had made from Erin Condren
22:14
that have pieces of my book cover on
22:16
them so even though it's not revealed
22:17
there's a piece of it in my facebook
22:19
group and they've seen this before so
22:21
I'm trying to decide exactly which date
22:24
I'm going to be revealing that cover but
22:29
you know what I think I'm gonna hold off
22:30
on that because I'm not sure so this is
22:33
my monthly spread and that's all I'm
22:36
going to add to it now I will go back to

hey guys it's Sarah from heart briefings
0:09
and it has been a few weeks since I've
0:11
been able to upload a video but I
0:13
apologize for that it has been a wild
0:16
and crazy couple of weeks I have
0:18
published three books in the last month
0:20
and our two books in the last month and
0:22
I'm halfway through a third so it has
0:24
just been a little bit crazy and I
0:26
needed a break so I am actually just
0:29
getting around to editing some of the
0:30
videos that I recorded earlier and this
0:32
is a plan with me that was from last
0:35
week so it's a little bit behind but I
0:37
figure still worth it to go ahead and
0:39
show kind of how I planned that week
0:41
with a writing retreat at the beginning
0:44
I did kind of show off that I have
0:45
switched into my new traveler's notebook
0:48
from chic Sparrow it is Odyssey Athena I
0:52
believe it's the pink color and it's got
0:54
the coffee stuff and all of that I'm
0:57
also showing here I got these new pins
0:59
these state-law pick pigment fineliners
1:01
and they come in Oh point one point
1:04
three point five and point seven and the
1:06
point three is my favorite that's the
1:09
one I use the most because it's it's
1:11
fine but it's not like ridiculously fine
1:14
and the point 5 has been useful for kind
1:16
of thickening lines I also got this new
1:19
happy planner sticker book with the
1:21
colorful boxes I'm gonna use some I just
1:25
kind of grabbed some because I knew I
1:26
wanted to do some rose gold so I grabbed
1:30
like the glam girl the color story and
1:32
some of the other ones that I knew used
1:34
rose gold stickers and then I grabbed
1:37
some of my favorite rose gold washi
1:39
tapes and black and white and some blue
1:42
and it's kind of a blueish green or like
1:45
a mint color that I thought I would be
1:47
using I also have some just sort of
1:49
random stickers here that I might use
1:52
and some of my favorite pumpkin paper Co
1:56
ones and my favorite stencils that
2:00
you've probably seen me use before the
2:02
hobo Nietzsche stencil and then another
2:04
stencil that I got from Michael's that I
2:05
use all the time alright so now I'm
2:09
going to start kind of speeding things
2:10
up a little bit and I am
2:12
a little from what I did last time it
2:15
didn't think it was kind of close enough
2:17
so here I am I'm using the 0.3 of the
2:22
fineliners and I'm just putting down
2:24
some basic washy at the bottom and these
2:28
two colors don't actually like perfectly
2:29
match but I think when they're not like
2:31
right up close to each other you can't
2:33
really tell and I'm just taking this
2:36
heart section of the rose gold and
2:38
putting a little bit of that on there
2:40
and what I'm doing is if you didn't
2:43
follow my previous plan with me in the
2:46
hobo Nietzsche cousin there is a daily
2:49
page and a weekly and a monthly page so
2:52
I used the sunday daily page as sort of
2:55
my planning page for the rest of the
2:58
week and what I do is I just you know
3:02
this is not a Sunday planning page this
3:04
is just a weekly planning page so I take
3:06
that like Monday through the following
3:09
Sunday and then I write out what my
3:11
goals are for that week so again I
3:14
apologize this is a week getting
3:15
uploaded I actually did record it on
3:19
time but it's just been insane the last
3:22
couple of weeks so here I found these
3:25
stickers like super clearance at
3:26
Michaels and they were like $0.99 or
3:29
something and then I think it was like
3:31
an additional 20% off all sale items and
3:34
they have some rose gold checkmarks and
3:37
then these pretty kind of blue flowers
3:39
that I decided to use for just sort of
3:41
like the bullet points so here what I'm
3:43
doing is I'm writing out my goals for
3:46
the week starting with 30,000 words on
3:49
my work in progress which is a lot for a
3:51
week but I did a writing retreat last
3:53
week and then seen plotting for which is
3:56
Mark and brainstorming for deceiving
3:58
darkness which is my next shadow demons
4:01
book so I've got a lot of things kind of
4:02
going at once and this year it's really
4:04
important to me to be writing as quickly
4:06
as I can but to keep the quality up so
4:09
it's good for me to just sort of keep an
4:10
eye on what's coming up and spend some
4:13
of my free time in the afternoons after
4:14
my writing is done working on plotting
4:17
and sort of brainstorming that sort of
4:19
stuff so I'm also doing some marketing
4:21
stuff some basic ads one
4:24
to do a Facebook live but that did not
4:25
get done also I worked on my newsletter
4:28
a little bit getting some gdpr stuff if
4:30
you're not familiar with that just be
4:32
happy that you don't have to deal with
4:33
it and then heart breathing's just kind
4:36
of wrote out what I plan to do for this
4:39
and recording some new videos and
4:41
editing them it has been about almost a
4:45
month since I've had a chance to really
4:46
get a new blog post up and record and to
4:49
be honest that just is gonna happen
4:51
sometimes because there's there's no way
4:54
that I can keep this going like two to
4:56
three videos a week and be writing you
5:00
know two books in a month it's just I'm
5:02
trying to do a lot more than I've ever
5:03
done before and it's great but it's also
5:06
like I have to give myself a break
5:08
sometimes too so okay so now that I've
5:11
written down my goals for the week now
5:13
I'm going to the actual weekly spread
5:16
and I'm gonna start decorating so I just
5:18
took some of those stickers that sort of
5:20
match my color scheme covered at the
5:23
monthly view box because I don't
5:25
typically use that and I apologize I see
5:27
that you know some of this is below the
5:30
frame I was trying to zoom in a little
5:33
bit so you could see my writing a little
5:35
bit better this time and it looks like I
5:37
can sort of cut off the bottom so par
5:39
for the course on these weeks that
5:41
everything was just so busy it's a
5:44
learning process so you know give myself
5:46
a little bit of leeway there I know that
5:48
I pull it up later so you'll see it but
5:50
I just took some kind of striped rose
5:52
gold washi and put it along the bottom
5:55
and also sort of scalloped mermaid look
6:00
of rose gold and I covered that mint
6:03
there at the top also just to give it a
6:07
little bit more of that rose gold feel
6:09
now I'm looking back at last weeks and
6:12
just kind of seeing like how did I do it
6:15
was there anything I need to carry over
6:17
just grab a couple little stickers there
6:19
too you know to make it look nicer now I
6:21
have these like bolder bond roads and I
6:26
love these I actually need to order more
6:28
because I've used some of the favorite
6:30
colors of them I probably probably need
6:31
like all black but so I did this writing
6:34
retreat in Athens
6:36
with my friend Bella and so I wrote out
6:39
like the time that I plan it to be on
6:41
the road to Athens and we were smoothly
6:43
spending the entire week in Athens up
6:48
till Thursday writing and this for me is
6:52
a really good chance to get everything
6:55
done to get a little bit ahead and if I
6:58
was not doing these writing retreats I
7:00
think it would be really difficult for
7:02
me to have already published three books
7:03
this year it is absolutely not normal
7:06
for me like the last few years I've only
7:09
written two books per year so to already
7:12
have three out by May is a pretty big
7:15
deal for me and you know I'm really
7:18
having to be very cautious of not
7:21
burning out because it really does seem
7:24
like honestly working this hard and this
7:29
many hours per week I've had some weeks
7:31
that I've worked probably 70 plus hours
7:34
a week between heart breathing's and my
7:38
writing and the marketing and things
7:39
that go into the writing and I honestly
7:42
just started to feel like I was getting
7:45
super burned out even falling into like
7:47
a mild depression I would say like when
7:50
I would have a few hours to do something
7:53
that would be considered fun I honestly
7:56
couldn't think of anything that sounded
7:58
fun everything just kind of sounded like
8:01
I don't even know how to explain it just
8:04
like I don't want to do that I don't
8:07
have any not even gaming or you know
8:10
anything like that could get me excited
8:12
all I wanted to do was go to bed and
8:14
then once I was in bed it was kind of
8:16
hard to get up so I started noticing
8:17
those warning signs and thought okay I
8:19
need to take a break so that's why
8:21
there's been a little bit of a break
8:22
from heart briefings but I'm back now
8:25
and I'm feeling much better so thank you
8:28
for your patience I hope you guys are
8:29
still with me and watching this so I
8:33
just wrote down that my goal was 10,000
8:35
words for that first night and then now
8:38
I'm writing just the words writing
8:40
retreat over the top
8:42
previously on some writing retreats what
8:44
I used to do was try to actually keep my
8:47
writing sprint
8:50
marked down on this weekly page but then
8:53
really since the hobo Nietzsche also has
8:56
those daily pages I didn't really see
8:58
any point in writing them in both places
8:59
so I just covered that entire thing with
9:02
the words writing retreat and I'm gonna
9:05
write down that my goal for you know
9:08
each day also is going to be 10,000
9:11
words and spoiler alert I did not quite
9:16
hit that goal because the first day I
9:18
ended up doing a lot of plotting and
9:20
brainstorming and then Bella also had
9:22
some brainstorming that she needed to do
9:23
on her story so we we did work really
9:26
hard that first day but I did not get
9:29
the full 10,000 words those two day or
9:32
that first day and then the second day I
9:33
got about 8,000 words and the third day
9:36
I did hit the 10000 so I did not quite
9:40
get as many words as I had hoped but it
9:43
was still a really great start and
9:44
definitely worth it to sort of get away
9:47
and have some time to focus completely
9:50
on the writing rather than having to
9:54
also focus on you know keeping the house
9:57
clean and all those other things that go
9:59
with staying home now I do when I go on
10:02
these retreats I really do miss my son I
10:04
have a five year old son and so we do a
10:07
lot of video chatting and things like
10:08
that and my husband does not work a
10:10
normal job either so he you know can
10:13
step in and do a lot for my son when I
10:16
need to be writing which I know is a
10:18
luxury and I'm very grateful to it to
10:21
him for that but it's the only way that
10:23
I'm getting as many books I actually set
10:26
probably the biggest writing goal for of
10:29
my life for this year trying to get
10:31
ahead on series that I got behind on
10:33
when I really burned out the last couple
10:35
of years so I've been working on that a
10:37
lot and as you'll see here on Thursday I
10:40
decided to head home and then I was
10:43
going to work on my paperbacks which I
10:45
got a little bit of work done on that I
10:47
did unpack and do my laundry and then we
10:50
did head to the beach for a little bit
10:52
and as always when I get back from one
10:55
of these retreats where I haven't really
10:57
slept much and I'm really
10:58
hired we went out to dinner so the this
11:02
I planned this stuff before so I'm kind
11:04
of giving you an idea of what happened
11:06
afterward but yeah I did get a lot of
11:10
that stuff done and it really has been
11:13
helpful to me to have this planner where
11:18
I've got pretty much like it is an
11:20
hourly planner and I do sort of like
11:23
that was the times that I was driving
11:25
home but then I just put those bullet
11:26
points out for the evening even though
11:29
that's not the time I wanted to get it
11:31
done so I'm not like really strict on
11:33
okay this says it's done at two o'clock
11:36
so I've got to work on it at two o'clock
11:38
I just more use it sort of as a to-do
11:40
list with some time I guess like
11:44
guidelines there but I don't follow it
11:46
strictly to a tee so this I'm pulling
11:49
from the glam girl sticker book and they
11:52
have some rose gold of they're like
11:55
happy planner asterisks so I'm just
11:57
writing down that I had planned to
12:00
record a few more things
12:02
I've got a few videos coming up that
12:05
I've already outlined but I did not
12:08
actually get a chance to do that because
12:09
I was so exhausted when I got home on
12:11
Thursday that I spent most of Friday
12:13
just sort of decompressing and taking
12:16
some time off and then I spent most of
12:18
the weekend with my family so I didn't
12:20
get that work done and that's okay
12:22
sometimes we just need that break but on
12:26
Friday afternoon I had plans to edit
12:29
videos and create some images for heart
12:33
breathing so I got all this stuff
12:34
written down and it didn't end up
12:36
getting done but he's like I said that's
12:38
okay I've actually moved it already to
12:40
getting done this week and you know this
12:44
is one of the big things about being a
12:45
creative entrepreneur and being someone
12:48
who sets their own schedule I think that
12:51
you have to you know make the best plans
12:54
that you can but you have to really pay
12:56
attention to whether or not you're
12:58
feeling burned out whether or not you
13:00
feel like you've kind of reached a limit
13:02
and make sure that it's not like you're
13:04
self sabotaging like oh you're getting
13:06
so close to this level of success that
13:07
you're just gonna push yourself down but
13:10
that you know it's
13:12
really like time for a break time to
13:14
take a step back because I think that a
13:16
lot of us who are creative entrepreneurs
13:18
it's like we enjoy the creative side of
13:22
it we enjoy the creation but then
13:25
there's also so much marketing and
13:28
headache that goes into just letting
13:31
people know that it honestly exists like
13:34
letting people know that your product
13:38
exists or that your books are out there
13:40
or whatever it is like whatever kind of
13:42
entrepreneurial business you're in it's
13:45
it's really tough because some of us
13:48
like we really would rather just do the
13:50
creative part but there is a marketing
13:52
side of it and it can get pretty
13:54
exhausting sometimes so I think it's
13:57
just super important I can't stress
13:58
enough like how important it is to pay
14:01
attention to what's going on in your
14:04
life and whether or not you know you
14:07
feel like you're up to working as hard
14:10
as you've been working and when you
14:11
really need a break because sometimes I
14:14
think if we push ourselves past the
14:16
point where we really needed a break
14:17
we're really going to be in trouble and
14:20
we're gonna miss a lot of extra time
14:22
because of it all right so now I have
14:25
finished most of the week I did add some
14:29
things that I wanted to work on with
14:30
paperbacks and some of that stuff has
14:32
also gotten moved to this week because I
14:35
didn't get it fully done we also took my
14:37
son to a birthday party it seems like
14:39
the kind of time of year where
14:41
everybody's having a birthday party
14:43
where even my son's birthdays in June so
14:45
we're having a party for him too so it's
14:47
like every weekend there's some kind of
14:49
party and it's fun and we get to see the
14:51
parents but sometimes it's like oh my
14:53
gosh another party but this one was
14:55
really cool it's like out in the woods
14:56
in John's Island and it was just kind of
14:58
a neat party to go to and then we kind
15:01
of watched a family movie night and went
15:03
to the beach again on Saturday afternoon
15:05
and then on Sunday I did my weekly
15:08
planning I had planned to do like I said
15:10
a Facebook live but that did not get
15:12
done and we watch Silicon Valley and
15:15
West world every week and Silicon Valley
15:20
is sadly is over for the year so
15:24
episodes of that one if you haven't seen
15:25
that show it is freaking hilarious
15:27
Westworld is also really really good
15:30
it's kind of like a science fiction sort
15:33
of alternate not alternate future but
15:36
like a science fiction sort of thing as
15:38
you can see like I had this empty space
15:41
on Thursday morning and I was trying to
15:43
think how do I fill it I thought about a
15:44
little box there are some other things
15:46
and then I finally just grabbed some
15:47
flour and wrote the word joy so I can
15:50
remember cuz I think that that ends up
15:52
being honestly like the worst thing for
15:54
me is that I don't it's not that I don't
15:57
remember to have fun but it's just that
15:59
I need to keep my eye on why I'm doing
16:02
this because otherwise it is easy to get
16:04
burned out when you kind of forget your
16:06
reasons behind why you're doing this
16:08
career because you know it's all good
16:10
and fun when you're making a lot of
16:12
money or when things are going really
16:14
well but once you start to have a few
16:16
tough days or a few tough months I think
16:19
the most important thing is to really
16:21
remember why you're doing it instead of
16:24
you know thinking about the money and
16:26
stuff like that that's why I always
16:28
encourage people to write books that you
16:29
love rather than books that just seem
16:32
trendy because in the end to stick with
16:35
such a really tough and emotional career
16:38
it is so important to be writing
16:40
something that like turns you on that
16:42
makes you feel passionate and so that's
16:45
kind of my little soapbox there alright
16:47
so now I have moved over to the daily
16:49
pages and this is the Monday page so I
16:53
just am writing some things out because
16:55
I know I'm gonna be on this retreat the
16:57
following week and what I do usually is
16:59
I tend to decorate every day of that
17:03
week in the same colors of washi and the
17:05
same basic color scheme that I did my
17:08
weekly layout so I've carried that same
17:11
sort of mint green and rose gold over to
17:13
the days and then I've used this stencil
17:16
to mark out some just different icons
17:20
like marketing is a coffee cup my
17:22
writing is usually this little book and
17:24
I used to start for Wattpad because I'm
17:26
uploading my book deaths awakening to
17:28
Wattpad three chapters a week so just
17:30
kind of a reminder that chapter 21 went
17:33
up on
17:34
day and then I'm going ahead and writing
17:36
out those sprints and I had planned or
17:39
hoped to get at least ten Sprint's done
17:41
every day so I wrote out you know eleven
17:44
just in case and then a place to mark my
17:46
total and like I said in the end this
17:49
did not get filled out with a bunch of
17:51
sprints it got filled out with a bunch
17:53
of hours of talking through the story
17:56
which sometimes is just as important so
17:59
here I am just kind of marking those
18:01
same colors and you can just sort of see
18:03
how I decorate the daily pages and carry
18:07
that color scheme over from week to week
18:10
it's easier than like trying to come up
18:13
with a brand new color scheme every week
18:14
and it kind of is just a visual cue that
18:17
these days all sort of belong together
18:20
so I'm also using some of those same
18:23
stickers from I think this is the glam
18:25
Girl sticker book and it's got that
18:27
pretty rose gold in it the rose gold
18:29
doesn't show up as well on camera as I
18:31
wish it did but it really is a beautiful
18:34
sticker book with some pretty rose gold
18:36
foiling on it and I love it but I don't
18:39
think that the glam girl sticker book is
18:41
available anymore I think it was like a
18:43
special edition like once they're gone
18:44
they're gone but you might be able to
18:46
find them online at me and my big ideas
18:49
calm so again on Tuesday I'm just going
18:52
back and writing in sprints and
18:54
numbering them and I was hoping that
18:57
maybe I would get at least you know 10
19:00
to 14 sprints done that day and I think
19:03
I ended up with maybe eight Sprint's
19:06
that day seven or eight and you know
19:08
like I said I've been feeling like extra
19:10
tired lately so I feel like it is still
19:13
a huge win for me to have gotten about
19:15
8,000 words that day and then I wrote
19:18
Sprint's again on Wednesday and did
19:21
spend most of that day writing sprints
19:24
and I got through the first act of my
19:25
story and so it was good progress and it
19:29
is a good thing to have I think these
19:31
daily pages whereas if I was using like
19:33
an Erin Condren or a happy planner I
19:36
think I would have liked not enough room
19:38
to write out all the times that I'm
19:41
sprinting and stuff like that so this is
19:43
why I love having the hobo Nietzsche
19:45
that has so much space on
19:48
so that is basically the entire plan
19:51
with me I just had a retreat total and
19:54
then I left most of the rest of the week
19:56
blank just kind of wrote out what time I
19:59
was driving home and that's as much as I
20:01
setup and that's actually a little bit
20:02
more than I will normally set up but you
20:04
kind of get an idea for how I use my
20:05
daily plate pages and I'll probably go
20:08
back and use that Saturday empty page as
20:10
a journaling page just a real quick view
20:13
of my May monthly and I'll take you back
20:16
through and let you see a little bit
20:18
closer up of the entire design thank you
20:21
guys so much for hanging out with me
20:23
with a plan with me this week on the
20:26
hobo neat even though it is a week late
20:28
let me know if you like these types of
20:29
videos and would like to see more of
20:31
them please don't forget to subscribe
20:34
and comment make sure to give this a
20:36
thumbs up if you enjoyed it and I am
20:39
sorry that it took me a few weeks to get
20:41
back to you but now the videos are
20:43
coming strong so hopefully there'll be a
20:44
few coming up this week and every week
20:47
from now on throughout the summer thanks
20:49
so much guys and I will see you in my
20:51
next video
hey everybody its Sara back with another
0:03
plan with me you guys really seem to be
0:05
enjoying these so I thought I would go
0:07
ahead and show you how I set up my June
0:09
calendar I'll be using these pigma
0:11
micron pins
0:12
it's just various sizes of those also
0:15
these paper mate players I think these
0:16
are from the candy pop colors I've also
0:20
just picked out some of my favorite
0:22
washy that I thought I would use for the
0:25
color palette this month and also I've
0:29
got these like acrylic stamps that I got
0:32
from Tuesday morning they're Heidi Swapp
0:34
and they're really cute but they were
0:35
like $0.99 and then an additional 30%
0:38
off so they were super cheap and then if
0:40
somebody told me that these versa
0:42
magic tanks do not bleed in the hub
0:46
Aniki they do take some time to dry so I
0:48
did pick up some of those and I'm gonna
0:50
try using them today I've got the create
0:53
365 sticker books and Miami sticker
0:55
books and then I got these cute little
0:57
stickers that were a dollar at Michaels
1:00
and then they were 25% off with a coupon
1:04
from last weekend so they were super
1:06
cheap so I'm gonna just pull my hope and
1:08
Nicci out and get started with a plan
1:11
with me so as you can see I tend to
Monthly Spread
1:20
bring out like everything I might
1:21
possibly use and then don't use half of
1:24
it but that's okay it's all part of the
1:26
process and I actually don't put a ton
1:28
of stuff on my monthly planner and as I
1:31
go like you know throughout the previous
1:33
months I will just sort of pencil in or
1:35
what I should do is use those friction
1:37
pins that I could erase but instead I
1:40
just use a regular pen and then I cover
1:42
them with other things as I go so I've
1:45
already gotten some things written on
1:47
here but I'm gonna kind of make it a
1:48
little bit prettier but I don't
1:50
typically use this monthly spread to put
1:52
like everything I'm doing over the
1:55
course of the month it's really just
1:56
something I look back on every once in a
1:58
while and go okay these are the big sort
1:59
of the big-ticket items and one of the
2:02
strange things about this hope andg
2:04
paper is that like sometimes the ends
2:06
tend to sort of coil up so like or curl
2:10
up once I put the washi on so you have
2:12
to put it on
2:13
really straight so everyone smile you
2:14
see me pull it up and try again
2:17
and I just picked up you know some of
2:20
these colors and decided to put them
2:23
down the washi tape first so that I
2:25
could go ahead and sort of establish the
2:27
colors and something else that I did
2:30
because I don't love the way that the
2:33
dates look on the Hoban Ichi it's just
2:37
kind of it's very Japanese and it looks
2:39
fine but it's just I would love
2:40
something that just looked a little bit
2:42
prettier I guess so I used my Cricut to
2:46
use like a handwritten written font I
2:49
think this one is called Wonderland it's
2:53
just from a different like handwriting
2:55
bundle I think I got off creative market
2:57
and I just made these little stickers
2:59
and this is the first time I've tried
3:01
something like this to put these little
3:02
day-of-the-week stickers at the top and
3:04
I actually really like the way it turned
3:06
out I think it just sort of adds a
3:09
little bit of beauty to the monthly
3:12
spread I don't know tell me what you
3:15
guys think but I really like it it takes
3:17
some of the plane this away and you'll
3:18
see I'm just kind of playing around with
3:20
different ideas for what to do with the
3:21
washi and end up not really adding more
3:23
then you can also see this sticker sheet
3:25
I knew what colors I wanted to use so I
3:27
took some of my favorite icons that I've
3:29
shown in photos before our videos before
3:32
and I made them in a color that matched
3:35
my washi with my Cricut so I'm going to
3:37
be using those throughout this spread
3:38
and as you can see there like I covered
3:41
up something I already had written and
3:43
I'm just kind of making it prettier and
3:44
making it stand out so I'm in a group
3:47
called freshly implemented which is a
3:49
business group and we have a theme every
3:51
month and this theme month this month is
3:54
to fail-proof your business and so I
3:56
just went ahead and wrote that fresh
3:58
theme on there because they'll be like
4:00
webinars and what they call power hour
4:02
and stuff like that
4:04
throughout the month sort of focusing on
4:06
that business theme so I like to
4:08
highlight it in my planner for the month
4:10
and then on the 4th I have a pen name
4:15
project of something that I wrote last
4:17
year that I'm finally gonna be
4:18
publishing under a pen name so I am
4:21
working on the cover art have that
4:23
booked for Monday June 4th so I went
4:25
ahead and
4:26
noted that then I have a what's called a
4:28
back pocket TLC with my business mentor
4:30
amber McHugh on Tuesday so I marked that
4:33
as well and then I'm getting coffee with
4:36
a new business friend of mine she's a
4:38
local graphics designer on Wednesday so
4:40
I wrote that in and then on the seventh
4:43
is that Power Hour and everything I was
4:45
talking about for freshly implemented
4:47
but I can't attend because my little guy
4:49
my son andrew is graduating from
4:52
basically from the primary of Montessori
4:56
if you're not familiar with Montessori
4:58
it's they go in grade level instead of
5:01
like kindergarten first second third
5:03
grade they go in age group so three
5:05
through six year old is the first like
5:07
primary and he'll be graduating from the
5:09
three to six and moving up to elementary
5:12
but it's basically like a kindergarten
5:13
graduation for him so that is on
5:15
Thursday and it'll be his last day of
5:17
school and I'm actually getting a little
5:19
bit nervous because he's been in
5:22
Montessori since he was two and he'll be
5:26
six on the twelfth and every summer he's
5:30
been in school and so has a writer I
5:33
haven't had my son home with me for like
5:35
two months in a row so it's going to be
5:37
a real challenge and maybe I'll do a
5:39
video on how to stay productive even
5:41
when your kids are at home or you've got
5:43
a lot going on because as of Thursday
5:46
next week he will be home with me all
5:48
summer and I'm a little bit nervous
5:49
about my productivity but we'll see how
5:52
it goes if you guys have any tips for
5:53
how to keep working even when your kids
5:56
are home let me know so I also sorry
5:59
it's kind of out of the shot I'm still
6:01
kind of learning here how to zoom in and
6:03
still keep everything in the shot but
6:05
you can see like a gold full sticker
6:07
there that I used from the colorful
6:08
boxes of the Mandy and it's just marking
6:11
that my son has his birthday party at a
6:14
trampoline park here in the area on
6:17
Saturday so I marked that for him and
6:19
then on the week of the 18th my sister
6:22
and her girlfriend are coming to visit
6:24
for most of the week I believe so I
6:26
marked that off with washi because I do
6:28
not anticipate getting a lot of writing
6:31
done that week she does know that I'm
6:33
still going to be working but they were
6:35
supposed to come Memorial Day weekend
6:37
and couldn't come because the weather
6:38
was really bad so you know we had to
6:42
postpone that trip and so now they're
6:44
coming in June so I'm hoping that I can
6:45
get my current work in progress finished
6:49
and then sort of take that week off and
6:51
okay so what you can see here is I
6:53
bought one of those like acrylic blocks
6:55
and I'm using the stamps that you can
6:59
put on the blocks and these are like the
7:01
Heidi Swapp stamps that I really
7:03
genuinely got for like sixty-five cents
7:05
at a Tuesday morning it was insane and
7:07
I'm going to put happy birthday on the
7:10
12th because that is my son's sixth
7:14
birthday he's my only child and so we're
7:16
gonna probably be doing a lot of really
7:18
fun stuff with him over the next week or
7:20
so as we celebrate so I was just kind of
7:23
like playing around with where I was
7:24
going to place that and since I had
7:27
already written something on there I
7:28
covered it up with washi and just to
7:30
kind of make it a little bit less
7:32
standout and then I'm practicing
7:34
stamping that on to make sure I'm
7:36
getting this versa
7:37
magic ink on it's like a chalk based ink
7:39
so it doesn't go on the same way like
7:43
normal inks do so I'm just kind of
7:46
testing it and there it goes on and I
7:48
think it actually turned out pretty good
7:50
then I've got these honest company baby
7:52
wipes and that's what I use to clean my
7:54
stamps if if you do use these sort of
7:57
like acrylic and rubber stamp
7:58
combinations then I think that you would
8:01
like using baby wipes to clean them off
8:03
because it really gets all the ink off
8:05
of it which is nice alright so I took
8:09
just a little planner icon and wrote
8:13
down playing with me Jun which is what I
8:14
was filming and we'll be getting out
8:16
today and I also put a little girl stamp
8:22
up there that said Bristol's party cuz
8:23
we had another birthday party to attend
8:26
this past weekend then I'm also marking
8:29
down the days of this month that I'm
8:31
planning to actually film I try to batch
8:33
film my videos like do several in a day
8:37
so that I'm not filming like every
8:39
single week or all the time and I know
8:40
I'm gonna have to batch film because my
8:42
sister's coming to visit and I just
8:43
won't get anything done but then I'm
8:45
planning to also do a plan with me for
8:47
July toward the end of the month so I
8:48
went ahead and marked that down as well
8:51
if you guys enjoyed these videos let me
8:53
know so that I know to keep doing them
8:55
and what you can see here is like I
8:57
noticed that underneath that washi you
8:59
could still see what I had written
9:00
Andrew's birthday so I just like peeled
9:03
it up and put some whiteout on it so you
9:05
couldn't see it now what I'm doing on
9:07
this left-hand side here is I'm just
9:10
putting in my work in progress I have
9:12
three projects that are partially
9:14
finished so this is not like all words
9:16
that I want to get in the month of June
9:18
but it's just projects I would like to
9:19
finish up so I'm writing three different
9:22
projects which is Mark is book 7 in my
9:24
Willow Harbour series which is under my
9:26
main name and the other two things are
9:29
partially completed pen name projects
9:32
that I'm not going to mention here in
9:34
terms of the actual names but those are
9:36
things I would like to finish up so I'm
9:38
hoping actually for about 80,000 words
9:40
this month which is pretty beefy
9:41
especially with my sister coming but
9:43
we'll see how it goes now what you'll
9:46
see next is I actually feel like I need
9:49
an editorial calendar so what someone
9:52
suggested to me was like I was wanting
9:54
to kind of go and get an Erin Condren
9:55
but somebody was like if you don't know
9:57
if you're gonna use it why don't you go
9:58
get a recollections calendar from
10:00
Michael so they're very similar to the
10:02
Erin Condren and I grabbed an
10:05
eighteen-month because they had them on
10:07
sale for only $10 and we'll see if I end
10:11
up using it it does have some cute
10:13
stickers in the back but what I realized
10:14
when I got home was it doesn't start
10:16
until July so I can't really use that
10:21
just yet so I decided to do something
10:24
different for the month of June and I'll
10:26
show that to you guys in just a second
10:29
because you might find it interesting I
10:31
did go and just pick out another sticker
10:34
to kind of make that look nice and then
10:35
you can also see here how at the
10:37
beginning of June in the actual daily
10:39
pages I just glued down what my goals
10:43
are from that 90 day planning goal which
10:45
I'll pop in a link to here okay so I'm
Bullet Journal
10:48
gonna slow this down and show you what
10:49
I've decided to try for the month of
10:51
June which is more of a bullet journal
10:52
spread and this is tomo river paper so
10:56
it is very thin and you can see through
10:58
it so if that bothers you might not want
10:59
to do it but I've written out a calendar
11:01
I have a growth checker there so that I
11:03
can say like
11:04
how much my social media has grown I've
11:06
also got a habit tracker and then I've
11:08
written out this is the purple is for my
11:11
Sarah Canon career which is my main pen
11:13
name so I've written out that I want to
11:15
blog do a blog post every single week
11:17
and then I would also like to post on
11:19
social media everyday so what I've done
11:22
is I've written out 30 days and I'm
11:23
going to actually make a note here of
11:26
the different social media posts that
11:31
I'm going to make then I've got a word
11:32
count tracker here that I would like to
11:35
get at least 80,000 words this month if
11:38
I can get to a hundred thousand-plus I
11:40
would love to do that and I have
11:42
actually done that twice this year but
11:44
we'll see how that turns out I'll be
11:47
very very happy with eighty thousand I
11:49
feel like that's really pushing it as it
11:51
is but I'm gonna try that bullet journal
11:53
spread then I also have in my pink one
11:56
I've taken the same sort of spread and
11:59
I'm using it for heart breathing's which
12:02
is this YouTube channel and my blog I've
12:04
got another growth truck are there to
12:05
the side a habit tracker and then my
12:08
June editorial calendar which is to do a
12:10
video that's just a video like maybe a
12:14
planning thing once a week and then a
12:15
video and a post once a week as well so
12:18
two videos total one blog post and then
12:21
a social media post every single day so
12:23
we'll see how well I keep up with it in
12:25
this bullet journal spread if you like
12:27
that sort of lavender look that I've
12:29
drawn on the pages that comes from
12:32
Amanda wretchedly or Amanda etch doodles
12:35
I think is her name here on Instagram
12:38
but I will link her channel down below
12:40
cuz I kind of got that idea from her may
12:43
bullet journal so I've gone back to the
12:47
purple one which is Sarah cannon I made
12:49
a set of icon stickers that match the
12:53
purple and what I will do over time is I
12:57
will go in with the purple for Sarah
12:59
cannon the pink color-coordinated for
13:02
heart breathing's and I will go on to
13:04
this main calendar and I will put like
13:06
the days I'm planning to film the days
13:08
that I'm planning to write blog posts
13:10
and kind of keep it as an editorial
13:12
calendar this is I'm afraid it going to
13:15
be like too much to keep up with
13:17
but I want to see how it works since I
13:19
can't use that recollections planner
13:21
until July anyway I figured this can be
13:24
kind of an experimental month to see how
13:26
that works for me so I'm just going to
13:29
go ahead and mark down here the days
13:32
that I'm planning to put up a video like
13:34
Sunday is actually today which I will be
13:37
posting this plan with me on Sunday so
13:39
that's going up and then there will be
13:42
you know more videos hopefully going up
13:44
every Wednesday and Sunday for the rest
13:46
of the month so I'm going to just go
13:47
ahead and mark that here so while I'm
13:50
putting those down I'm speeding it up
13:52
just a little bit so you don't have to
13:53
sit and watch what I will actually do
13:55
later is go back in and fill in the
13:57
topics that I'm plan to cover in each
13:59
one of these videos I do already have
14:01
that kind of planned out but I just
14:02
didn't want to include it in this video
14:04
because I didn't want to make it too
14:05
long then I've also got some little
14:08
filming things here some little cameras
14:12
that I'm putting on to remind myself of
14:14
which days I'm gonna actually be filming
14:16
and then later I'll actually add in the
14:18
days that I'm actually going to be
14:21
writing the blog post and that sort of
14:24
thing because I think that now that I'm
14:26
managing a couple of different pen names
14:28
as well as you know this business on the
14:33
side of heart breathing's where I'm
14:35
putting in some YouTube videos I'm
14:36
working on developing a course I've got
14:39
blog posts coming in and I'm kind of
14:40
learning a whole new business when it
14:42
comes to sort of marketing myself as a
14:45
youtuber and someone who teaches then I
14:49
really need more organization I've also
14:52
marked down some little cameras here to
14:54
mark down the dates that I want to work
14:56
on my images for social media because I
14:58
would also like to like learn how to
15:00
batch those really well so I'm not like
15:02
taking pictures every day for Instagram
15:04
but I'm taking like three days a month
15:06
you know ten pictures each that I can
15:08
choose from that sort of thing and
15:11
you'll see I don't go in and actually
15:12
fill this entire thing out right here
15:14
but I will go in and probably do that
15:16
later this afternoon so that I have it
15:18
all planned out
15:19
and if you guys are interested when it
15:21
gets to be July I can go back through
15:23
and show you sort of how this worked and
15:26
whether or not this type of bullet
15:28
journal spread worked for me and
15:29
actually if you're interested in
15:30
seeing me actually like draw out instead
15:34
of just showing you the finished product
15:37
I would be happy to film that as well
15:39
just to show you how I drew out the
15:41
bullet journal spread for this month but
15:44
just let me know if you think this is
15:46
something that could be interesting this
15:48
is one thing that I love about the
15:50
travelers notebook is that I can have
15:52
you know four notebooks as well as my
15:54
hope in each e-all-in-one space so that
15:57
I can continually flip back and forth
15:59
that's why I'm not sure that
16:00
recollections planner is going to work
16:02
for me because it will have to be
16:05
outside of this travelers notebook so I
16:07
might not be able to carry it with me
16:08
the biggest downside is that it can
16:11
start to get kind of bulky to carry this
16:14
much like in your purse so you know
16:17
might not work for everybody you might
16:19
need something a little bit more small
16:22
but anyway so here is the final monthly
Final Spread
16:26
spread I need to go in and fill out that
16:27
checklist with my top goals but at the
16:30
time of filming this I hadn't really
16:31
decided exactly what my top goals were
16:33
for the month so I will fill that out
16:34
later I will love to show you guys as
16:38
this month progresses like how well this
16:40
bullet journal spread worked for me in
16:42
addition to the hobo Nietzsche we'll see
16:45
how it goes I'm always willing to
16:46
experiment and see what is gonna help me
16:49
be a little bit more productive but if
16:51
you guys enjoyed this please subscribe
16:52

16:58

[Music]
Welcome To Preptober!
0:45
okay so it's technically still September
0:48
but I wanted to get a jump start on it
0:50
so our new preptober planner is ready to
0:53
go so I'm going to tell you how to get
0:55
that I'm going to share with you all the
0:57
tools and things that I'm using and what
0:58
I'm writing and all the good stuff so
1:01
let's get started
1:07
okay so for anybody who is new to
1:11
nanowrimo and you're like what the heck
1:12
is this it is National novel writing
1:15
month which we shortened down to
1:17
nanowrimo and it happens every single
1:19
November it's a non-profit organization
1:22
that not only helps Youth and has lots
1:25
of programs for youth to get into
1:26
writing and creativity but it also
1:28
brings together hundreds of thousands of
1:30
writers across the globe every November
1:32
and throughout the year to write a 50
1:36
000 word novel in just 30 days and so
1:39
it's really about Community it's about
1:41
sitting down and actually putting your
1:43
ideas on paper and finding that extra
1:45
motivation now I know that it can sound
1:47
really daunting to write 50 000 words in
1:50
30 days that's basically
1:52
1667 words per day for 30 days and it is
1:57
hard it can be such a challenge that's
1:59
why it is a challenge and there's
2:00
goodies and certificates and all kinds
2:02
of fun stuff but before we get started I
2:05
do want to just encourage you to say
2:07
that you don't have to to actually even
2:09
aim for the 50 000 words to participate
2:11
in nanowrimo I've been doing this for
2:14
more than a decade and I've only won
2:16
about half the time and that's okay it's
2:19
about the community it's about making
2:20
progress and as long as you move forward
2:22
on your work in progress you're still
2:25
winning because you're moving forward
2:26
and the 50k in 30 days is really just
2:29
about timing so if you can release some
2:31
of that stress from yourself and just
2:33
have fun I think for the most part
2:35
you'll find that you're more successful
2:37
so that is what nanowrimo is and on this
2:40
channel heart breathing's I do daily
2:42
Vlogs every single day for the month of
2:45
November so that's coming up that'll be
2:47
called the nanowrimo Diaries but
2:49
preptober
2:50
is really what we lovingly call the
2:52
month of October where everybody starts
2:54
to get ready and prep their novels for
2:57
this writing marathon in November
3:00
because it is difficult to just sit down
3:02
and write 50 000 words without any kind
3:04
of planning or prep sometimes you're
3:06
having to find extra time in your
3:08
schedule to make room for that you're
3:10
having to plan these write-ins and
3:12
Sprints and different things like that
3:13
or you need to figure out what in the
3:15
world you're writing and what's going to
3:17
happen in that novel so that's kind of
3:19
what preptober is all about and you will
3:21
find a thriving Community here on
3:23
YouTube where people are sharing
3:25
preptober videos so your homework right
3:27
now is to go into the comments and let
3:29
us know another authortube channel that
3:31
you follow that has some great preptober
3:33
content that's coming out this year
3:36
because we'd love to you know spread the
3:38
love let's follow everyone's Channel and
3:40
let's get ready for nanowrimo so last
How To Join NaNo
3:43
year and the year before I believe I did
3:46
videos on how to join nanowrimo so I'm
3:49
just gonna link that as well as my
3:51
previous preptober playlist for you
3:54
basically you just go to nanowrimo.org I
3:57
will put that link down below you sign
3:58
up for an account if you've never had
4:00
one and then you can create a profile if
4:02
you already have an account you just
4:03
need to set up a project and when you go
4:05
to set up your project you will
4:07
associate it with an event and there'll
4:09
be a drop down box that allows you to
4:11
associate this particular goal with
4:13
nanowrimo 2022 and it's that easy so if
4:18
you have any questions about it or you
4:19
can't seem to figure it out just leave a
4:21
comment down below and I'll try to get a
4:23
little bit of help in there but rather
4:24
than go through it again here I'm just
4:26
going to link to those previous videos
4:28
that walk you through the process and
4:29
just switch out the year so on those
4:32
previous playlists you will find some
Previous Preptober Playlists
4:34
really good information that is still
4:36
going to be true to this day stuff like
4:39
how to choose which idea you're going to
4:42
write and how to actually stick with it
4:44
throughout the month instead of going
4:45
for that shiny object syndrome how to
4:48
develop your idea into a novel or a plot
4:51
how to stay motivated during nanowrimo
4:54
by creating a creativity toolbox how to
4:57
write faster so that you can get those
4:59
words in during Nano and how to use
5:02
index cards for how to plot I also show
5:04
you walk throughs of my own writing
5:07
planner there are lots of free things
5:09
that you can get that might help you
5:10
with your planning and plotting process
5:12
so if you're not on my newsletter yet
5:15
come join the hearties heartbreathing
5:16
newsletter one of the things that you're
5:19
going to get is this brand new preptober
5:21
planner so for those of you that are on
5:23
my list this just hit the resource
5:25
Library so check your email because you
5:27
have a link to go and download this it
5:29
only comes in letter form and I'm going
5:31
to be doing a full walkthrough of this
5:33
44 page free Planner on Sunday so be
5:37
sure to come back for that full
5:39
walkthrough and I'll kind of walk you
5:40
through all of the process and the math
5:42
and other things like that and this year
5:44
it is a little bit different so I think
5:46
you're gonna like it because it's I
5:48
think it's new and improved but once you
5:51
join the newsletter you will also get
5:52
access to my entire resource Library
5:54
where I share things like uh entire
5:57
printout on how to plot your novel or
5:59
how to plan your series or how to create
6:02
index cards and how to write scenes and
6:05
different things like that there's over
6:06
I think 20 resources in there totally
6:09
free to help you plot and plan your
6:11
novel or organize your life now let's
6:13
talk about the videos that I have coming
6:15
up this year I've got an entire schedule
6:18
for you and it is packed and I think
6:20
these are going to be some really good
6:21
videos now we'll also say that I know
6:24
not everybody on my channel and in my
6:26
community loves to participate in Nano
6:28
because for some people it's a little
6:30
bit of pressure or you're in the middle
6:31
of editing a project and you just don't
6:33
have the space for it so that's fine so
6:35
whenever I'm creating these resources I
2022 Preptober Schedule
6:38
do it with a mindset of I want want this
6:40
to be useful for everyone regardless of
6:43
whether you're actually doing nanowrimo
6:45
or not so even if you're not doing
6:47
nanowrimo I still encourage you to take
6:49
a look at the preptober workbook because
6:51
there are word count trackers in here
6:53
including a new like bubble word count
6:56
tracker and some other things including
6:58
like meal planning and plotting pages
7:00
and all kinds of stuff that can be
7:02
useful anytime you're writing a novel so
7:05
I'm hoping the same will be true for all
7:08
of these preptober videos so here's our
7:11
schedule for this year okay I'm so
7:13
excited to go through this schedule with
7:15
you so I will go ahead and let you know
7:18
I'm going to do the very best that I can
7:19
to get all these videos up on time and
7:22
to make them to the very best of my
7:23
ability so on the 2nd of October which
7:26
is this upcoming Sunday we're gonna do a
7:29
full preptober workbook slash planner
7:31
flip through so I'm going to take you
7:33
through how to use it what all the
7:35
little bubbles are for how you use the
7:37
word trackers how you use the meal plan
7:38
we're going to go through all of of that
7:41
then on next Thursday the 6th we're
7:44
gonna have a video on how to plan your
7:46

7:48

7:50

7:53
and my wall and all the planning tips
7:55

7:57
those of you who are pantsers so look
8:00
forward to that on the 9th of October
8:02
I'm gonna share my October planner setup
8:05
this is not so much about preptober but
8:08
I did want to let you know that it was
8:10
coming because I'm so excited for my
8:12
Halloween setup so I will be sharing
8:15
that
8:16
on the 13th I'm gonna do a video about
8:18
how to create a character profile and
8:21
how much of your characters Arc can you
8:24
figure out before you start writing and
8:26
what are some tips to figuring out your
8:28
character story arc and how to implement
8:30
that in your planning
8:31
then I'm also going to do a video on the
8:33
16th about how to plan if you're writing
8:36
a multiple POV story or if you're
8:39
writing a series so I feel like there's
8:41
not as much support out there for people
8:43
who are writing you know five six points
8:45
of view in a series or if you're writing
8:48
book three or book 12 of a series how do
8:50
you prep and how is it different than if
8:52
you're prepping a standalone novel on
8:55
the 20th will be probably the video I'm
8:57
looking forward to the most which is
8:59
prepping your life for writing a novel
9:01
so this is all the non-writing prep that
9:04
I'm excited to share with you like how
9:06
to get your friends and family on board
9:07
for the fact that you're writing a book
9:09
and you're going to be spending more
9:10
time on your laptop
9:13
how to prep your time and your space how
9:16
to even prep your wardrobe and get
9:19
things ready in your house how to plan
9:22
for your meals and do a little bit of
9:24
meal prep so I'm excited for this video
9:26
and I'm hoping it's going to be super
9:27
helpful
9:28
on the 27th I'm going to talk about
9:31
mental health and taking care of your
9:33
mental health during nanowrimo because I
9:35
know that for some people as exciting as
9:37
Nano is it can also be a bit stressful
9:40
and cause some anxiety about whether
9:42
you're hitting your goals or you know
9:44
what happens if you hit mid-month and
9:46
you just don't feel like you can go are
9:48
you a failure you're absolutely not a
9:50
failure and we're going to talk about
9:51
how to handle and take care of your
9:53
mental health during this challenge
9:55
on the 30th right before we start Nano
9:59
just a couple days before we start we'll
10:01
be doing a special live q a on this
10:03
channel where we'll be answering any of
10:05
your questions that you have lingering
10:06
about how to get ready and how to
10:08
succeed during Nano and I will have some
10:11
special guests with me so I hope you're
10:12
excited add these to your calendar get
10:15
excited with me make sure you're
10:16
subscribed if you aren't already and
10:19
let's do this preptober 2022.
10:22
so let's talk writing tools too because
Writing Tools
10:25
this is one of the fun parts for me I am
10:28
kind of a Perpetual student a stationary
10:30
lover and I love getting my sticky notes
10:34
and my pens and everything else together
10:36
so I'm just going to share with you the
10:39
tools that I'm mostly using and then
10:41
we'll continue to expand on this later
10:43
in the preptober series also let me just
10:46
say how grateful I am to have this
10:49
beautiful office to write in and all of
10:51
these gorgeous spaces last year if you
10:53
followed my nanowromo Diaries you know
10:55
that I was living out of airbnbs and we
10:58
had no permanent home and it was a
11:01
challenge to say the least it was an
11:03
adventure that I'm grateful for but a
11:05
challenge and I am so grateful to have
11:07
this space that I can call my own so I'm
11:10
just putting that gratitude out there
11:12
first and I have all of my tools that I
11:15
didn't have with me that were in storage
11:16
while we were on the road one of them
11:18
being this Alpha smart so you might be
11:21
familiar with these you usually they're
11:23
just black and you can get them I think
11:25
they discontinued these like early 2000s
11:28
they used to be just for like word
11:30
processors in schools and they're very
11:34
simple devices they run off of three
11:36
double a batteries and they're just a
11:39
word processor so I took mine apart a
11:42
few years ago and spray painted it so it
11:44
would be this pretty color
11:45
and I also am using one called The Dana
11:49
so there are multiple versions of this
11:51
but the Dana you can put a one gigabyte
11:53
memory card in so that if your batteries
11:56
happen to fall out you don't lose all of
11:59
your work I actually let me know in the
12:02
comments if you have ordered the free
12:04
write Alpha which has just come into
12:07
Indiegogo I have no idea when they're
12:09
planning to ship those but I did back
12:10
that which is kind of an homage to these
12:13
Alpha smarts but you can find these
12:15
still used on like Amazon or Ebay but
12:18
these are really cool and you may say
12:20
but why would you write on that when you
12:23
have a laptop or a computer well the
12:25
reason is because it is totally
12:26
distraction free you have this tiny
12:29
little
12:31
space that you can see your work and
12:34
there's no frills no fuss there's no
12:37
Facebook on here nothing like that and
12:39
so it's just a way to plus it's super
12:42
portable so I can just put this in my
12:44
bag and it runs on batteries so this
12:46
will last for multiple days and I don't
12:49
have to worry about finding a plug-in or
12:51
anything like that but mostly it's the
12:52
destruction free and the keyboard is
12:54
really nice and so I love using this
12:57
especially during Nano when I need that
12:59
distraction free writing time so I have
13:02
this I also always pick up a candle that
13:06
for some reason it's like a mindset
13:09
trigger that says every time I light
13:12
this candle I know it's writing time
13:13
it's a little bit of a ritual that sort
13:16
of invites The Muse in and I found this
13:18
one at TJ Maxx it's called ghost stories
13:21
and it is kind of like a marshmallow it
13:23
says pumpkin spice marshmallows
13:24
caramelized over hickory wood a top
13:26
cinnamon graham crackers I mean but it
13:29
had a picture of a book on it so this
13:31
will be my preptober nanowrimo candle
13:34
and every time I come to write when I'm
13:36
in the house I'm going to light this so
13:38
that I know it's kind of like cozy
13:40
writing time I also love to have all of
13:43
my stationery supplies so I well we'll
13:47
talk a little bit more about what I'm
13:48
writing in a minute but I like to color
13:50
code my povs so most of the novels that
13:54
I've been working on lately are multiple
13:56
point of view novels and so in order to
13:59
plot and plan these books which there is
14:02
a video like I said coming up about
14:04
multi-pov
14:05
I like to color code so I will get these
14:09
like dot markers and Sharpies and maybe
14:13
like some of my favorite pins in the
14:15
color of each of these Post-it notes I'm
14:19
not actually going to be using this
14:20
yellow and I will be using instead uh
14:23
Pink and a black so I try to find and
14:27
create color codes that are based on the
14:29
supplies that I can find easily in like
14:31
Post-it notes and things like this I
14:34
also got this really cool Pomodoro Timer
14:36
it's just super simple from a cloth and
14:39
paper subscription box and so I'm going
14:41
to be using that on my desk so again
14:43
distraction free you can easily use your
14:46
phone but then you're going to be
14:47
tempted to oh I got a text message or I
14:49
got you know a new notification on
14:52
Facebook but with these two tools I have
14:54
zero distractions unless I want them the
14:57
main distraction that I still use my
14:59
phone for though is my music so I think
15:01
I'm gonna have to come up with a
15:03
solution for the music to not get
15:05
distracted did but having a Pomodoro
15:09
Timer separate is really nice I also use
15:12
a lot of note cards oh and the
15:16
prerequisite nanowrimo hoodie you can
15:19
get all the stuff at their store so
15:21
definitely check that out because
15:22
they've got mugs and all kinds of things
15:24
and I use washi tape in my color coding
15:27
and I use index cards now usually I use
15:32
the smaller index cards but this time I
15:34
am going to use these bigger ones
15:35
because I'm going to get a little bit
15:37
more granular about my scenes and if
15:39
you're interested to see what do I put
15:41
on my index cards I will link a video
15:44
for you down below from my recent scenes
15:46
series that explains what I put on index
15:49
cards
15:50
and what I like to do is I will put my
15:53
scenes and my point of view color coded
15:56
on index cards and then I will take
16:00
I think I have it in the other room I
16:02
will take a hole punch in the corner and
16:04
put this little book ring on it so that
16:06
I can just carry my note cards around
16:08
without them getting out of order so
16:10
that's really nice and then of course I
16:12
have like washi tape and some other
16:15
little supplies I do have also my
16:18
Delfonics utility pouch here that I love
16:20
because it is super super roomy and I
16:24
can also display some of my favorite
16:26
pins and things on here which for some
16:29
reason is just like an extra bit of
16:31
motivation to have things that you love
16:33
on there and this will fit these really
16:37
large Post-it or not Post-it notes this
16:40
will fit these really large index cards
16:42
it'll fit my Post-It notes in here and
16:45
all my pins and tools like everything
16:47
you see here except for this will fit
16:49
inside of this Delfonics pouch so then I
16:52
can just grab it and put it inside my
16:53
backpack which is really nice to be able
16:55
to carry stuff with me now a tool that I
16:59
have never used before
17:01
but I blame Holly black for this because
17:04
she was saying how she was using this
17:07
large graph paper and it's been so nice
17:10
for my plotting I've been using this not
17:12
only for plotting my recent book The
17:14
Disappearance of Vanessa Shaw but I've
17:16
also been using it for plotting out my
17:19
year coming up next year so I will share
17:21
with you guys later a little bit more
17:22
how I'm using this graph paper but I got
17:25
this off of Amazon it's it's nice and
17:28
big and it's really really cool so it's
17:30
just got blue kind of graph paper and I
17:33
think you can get these probably at any
17:35
stationery supply store I do also have a
17:38
clip here in case I end up printing
17:39
anything out and wanting to put it
17:42
together like if I'm currently editing
17:44
or working so now that I've kind of
17:47
broached that that I'm going to be
17:48
potentially working on something that
17:50
I'll need to print out let's talk about
17:51
what am I writing for Nano so this is
What I'm Writing
17:54
where things get a little bit more
17:56
complicated because I feel like when you
17:59
are a writer and you're trying to write
18:02
consistently it's very difficult to plan
18:05
your year such that on November 1st
18:08
you're ready to start a brand new
18:09
project but technically
18:12
nanowrimo is supposed to be about
18:14
starting a brand new project and writing
18:16
50 000 words on that new project however
18:19
I want to encourage you because I think
18:21
that some people that join Nano don't
18:23
understand that it's really loose like
18:26
there are technically rules but it's not
18:29
like anybody's coming after you if you
18:31
don't follow the rules to a t so this is
18:33
where Nano Rebels come in and it is
18:36
likely that this year I will be a nano
18:38
Rebel so a nano Rebel is just somebody
18:40
who's doing something a little different
18:42
than the traditional 50 000 words on a
18:44
new project so for you that might mean
18:46
that instead of writing 50 000 new words
18:48
you're going to edit last year's novel
18:51
or you're going to rewrite an old novel
18:53
or it might mean that you're in the
18:55
middle of a project and you're going to
18:56
finish the last 20 000 of that project
18:58
and start a new one and write 30 000 of
19:01
that one you might be writing thirty
19:03
thousand or fifty thousand words of blog
19:05
posts you might be setting a goal of
19:07
only 20 000 words for yourself now for
19:09
Camp nanowrimo you can actually set a
19:12
goal of 22 thousand words on the Nano
19:13
site for nanowrimo proper in November
19:16
the official goal has to be 50k but that
19:19
doesn't mean that you can't participate
19:22
unless you do 50k you can just say okay
19:25
I'll set the 50k goal online but my
19:28
personal goal is going to be 15 000 and
19:30
call that a win and reward yourself for
19:32
that 15 000 and be that Nano Rebel but
19:36
what I am probably going to be doing
19:38
this year is I'm probably going to be
19:41
working on yet again same as last year
19:43
book 12 of My Shadow Demon Saga now if
19:46
you were following me this time last
19:48
year I was trying to start and write
19:50
that book and I did actually write 30
19:52
000 or so words of it that I then
19:54
completely threw away I was too stressed
19:57
too much uncertainty too many things
19:59
going on and I just really didn't get
20:01
good words in and then after moving into
20:03
this new house and everything else I
20:06
just could not work on Book 12 of a
20:09
series that I had been writing for over
20:10
a decade it wasn't flowing it wasn't and
20:12
coming so you may have noticed from
20:15
previous videos if you've been around
20:17
for a while that I actually set up this
20:20
plotting wall so I'm going to show you
20:21
this in a second to start working on a
20:24
book I had started writing several years
20:26
ago called The Disappearance of Vanessa
20:28
Shaw and even though I have not taken
20:30
the time to put my Post-It notes up on
20:32
this board yet it's going pretty well
20:36
I don't know if it's going well enough
20:37
for me to say that it's finished before
20:40
November 1st because really in order for
20:43
me to completely work on Book 12 I'm
20:45
gonna have to finish Vanessa Shaw and
20:48
also be in a plotting place where I feel
20:51
like Book 12 is ready to go so I feel
20:53
like I'm not completely set up for a
20:56
brand new project Fresh Start November
20:58
1st and I'm a little bit nervous so let
21:00
me know in the comments if you also find
21:02
yourself scrambling to finish a project
21:04
so that you can try to start something
21:05
new in November because I feel like I am
21:07
not alone in this and I don't know so
21:10
what may happen is I get good progress
21:13
on Vanessa Shaw but I still have 20 or
21:16
30 000 left to right but not enough to
21:19
do the 50k in that case I will just
21:21
continue on with Vanessa Shaw and when
21:23
I'm done do my best to write an
21:25
additional set of words in another book
21:27
if I finish Vanessa Shaw then I'll work
21:30
on book 12. so it's gonna be a race down
21:33
to the last minute so the question might
21:36
be how do you prepare how do you do
21:38
preptober when you're still working on a
21:40
different novel and you don't know if
21:42
you'll finish it well my plan is to
21:45
continue to do my normal writing
21:47
continue to work on Vanessa Shaw and
21:49
know that I've got enough prepped for
21:51
that that I can at least continue on
21:54
with it when November starts but I'm
21:55
going to focus most of my preptober work
21:58
like in the planner and in my index
22:01
cards and everything else with the
22:03
assumption that I'll be writing Book 12
22:05
by then that way even if I'm writing
22:07
Vanessa Shaw for the first half of Nano
22:09
I have some work and prep done for the
22:11
second half but there's no like perfect
22:13
way to plan when you're in between books
22:16
so you just do the best you can and you
22:19
know keep moving forward and if it means
22:20
that you don't get 50 000 words in
22:22
November it's not really that big a deal
22:24
as long as you enjoyed and you moved
Final Thoughts
22:26
forward okay so that's a really a look
22:28
at the things that I'm doing right now
22:30
to prep but there's so much more that
22:33
I'm gonna share over the next coming
22:35
weeks of preptober if you're
22:37
participating this year in Nano please
22:39
go ahead and comment down below let me
22:40
know what you're writing or if you're
22:42
like me and some things are kind of
22:44
still up in the air or if you just have
22:46
tons of ideas and you haven't decided
22:48
yet what to write be sure to check out
22:49
my video that I did last year on how to
22:52
choose your project for Nano because I
22:54
think some of those tips will be helpful
22:55
also don't forget that I made this 44
22:59
page preptober planner just for you and
23:02

okay writer reset is underway so you kind of saw in the intro some of the
0:41
things that I did earlier this week is tore down the plotting wall that I had
0:46
and I have completely redone it so let me show you kind of what it looks like now and why I did this
0:52
so here is the new and improved plotting wall and I just realized as I'm looking at it that looks kind of like a piece of
0:59
handwriting paper or whatever that it won't look like that for long but so I have instead of putting Act One Horrors
1:07
or vertically I put them horizontally uh which is the way I used to have it for my book fate surrender which was really
1:13
helpful with multiple POV and I don't know why I didn't do it this time I thought the other way would be better
1:18
but this is definitely going to be better so this is act one through the
1:24
pink then all the way down here is act two part one act two part two so the midpoint of the book will be here
1:31
between act two part one and part two and then the third or the final doorway
1:37
into the third act down at the bottom so I'm definitely gonna have to actually sit down but I purposely made this a lot
1:44
bigger than it was before because I want to be able to really use this as I not
1:51
only finish the book but as I I edit it but if you're wondering what's the blue line for this book is written really in
1:58
sort of three separate timelines except it's really two so you have the present
2:03
day timeline and then you have the timeline from the night Vanessa disappeared and really that timeline is
2:11
the summer leading up to her disappearance so you have three sections of the book kind of spread out
2:17
throughout the chapters where you have present day you have the months leading up to that night and then you have the
2:23
actual night she disappeared so I want to be able to have the present day at
2:29
the top and then the reveals and the different scenes and how they're going to be woven together with the past
2:36
timeline down there I really think this is part of what's been missing in the book because right now I have a ton of
2:41
scenes all just in chronological order of what happened that night and then a separate timeline of what happened in
2:48
the present day but I haven't really successfully figured out exactly how I'm
2:53
going to weave those two timelines together in some places it's obvious and in other places I'm like oh where does
2:59
that need to be revealed because part of the tagline of this book it's called The Disappearance of Vanessa Shaw it's
3:05
basically a murder mystery teen Thriller murder mystery
3:10
and the tagline is everyone there had a reason to want Vanessa gone including me
3:17
and so everybody who was there the night Vanessa disappeared had some kind of
3:22
reason to want her gone slash murder her or something so everybody has a secret
3:29
and that is going to come out throughout the course of the book and I'm just
3:34
trying to decide when those Secrets get revealed because I think that's going to be the entirety of the success of this
3:40
book is how well are those twists and turns placed to surprise the reader and
3:46
to make them think oh my gosh maybe this person did it and to really be questioning who who did it and where is
3:53
Vanessa what happened to her so it's going to be fun I think but it's also I
3:59
think this is why I've been avoiding this sort of not avoiding but just but I think this is part of why this
4:05
last section is going to be harder so here's my plan for how to get back into my nanovel which is actually a finishing
4:14
or a revisiting of a book that I wrote when I was pregnant with Evie who just came in the room let me show you this
4:20
little flower she's got a little flower from outside so when I was pregnant with Evie so that
4:27
was like four years ago uh when I started this book and I got I don't know about 18 20 000 words in and then I
4:34
Revisited it last year and wrote a good bit of it during Nano so now I'm
4:40
revisiting it yet again and so if you also are somebody who has put down a book or a story and you've come back to
4:46
it or you have something you wrote for Nano but it feels like a big mess I'm gonna show you how I personally am
4:51
getting back into the story and you've seen this process before but hopefully just saying it again or showing it again will be helpful so one piece of the
4:58
process for me is resetting my tools now if you had a plotting board or you were
5:04
writing notes or anything there's no reason that you have to take it all down or start over but I just realized that
5:10
this particular visual structure would work out a little better I also have
5:15
taken the time to print out some photos of what I think my characters look like what I think the cabin looks like the
5:21
lake you know all of these things just for visuals and those will go up in the board word I also printed out everything
My Reset Plan
5:28
that I have so far in the book so this is about 60 000 words now technically I had more than that however I went
5:36
through already and deleted anything that was just like brainstorming stuff I didn't delete it but I just moved it to
5:41
a different file because that isn't usable editable words it's just me brainstorming and sometimes I count
5:47
brainstorming words during Nano because it's nano so I ended up with about 58 or
5:53
60 000. they're so cute uh I ended up with about 58 000 words so
5:59
what I'm gonna do today is I'm actually going to take my plotting book I'm going
6:05
to take my manuscript that I have printed out my highlighters and everything I actually use tombow dual
6:10
brush pens because I have better colors for the characters this is a big like it's there's a lot of points of view in
6:16
this book and that's another part of the struggle is making sure that people don't get confused about who's who and
6:23
that kind of thing it's a bigger cast of characters but it's not over 12 or 13 books like I've done before it's just
6:28
one standalone book so I want to make sure everybody has their own sort of distinct personalities and and way of
6:35
talking and and all that so I'm going to be making notes about that kind of thing and their personalities and what I have
6:41
so far what I feel like still needs to be written so I'm going to go do that at a coffee shop and I only have about an
6:47
hour and a half before I have to go pick my son up so that'll be a perfect amount of time to
6:54
life I mean Andrew yeah so that'll be the perfect amount no I gotta go by myself
7:00
no what are you gonna do at a coffee shop you're gonna eat cookies is that why you
7:05
want to go to the coffee shop yeah so you can get cookies wow yeah no yeah
7:13
so I am gonna work on that and then when I get home with Andrew I'm gonna do
7:19
Sprints that are alternating so I'm gonna spend 30 minutes working on the final scenes note cards I already have
7:26
some of that figured out so I already know what I'm going to be writing because I need to start writing the ending so I have a completed draft and
7:32
then I'm gonna spend the other 30 minutes working on these decorations here in this room so let me show you
Organizing My Office
7:38
kind of what I've done so far in the organization stage of my writer recent so these are this is the progress I've
7:45
made so far I put black knobs on this so it kind of Fades in and then I covered this in contact paper and
7:53
now it has a white surface so I'm going for kind of a black white and purple theme in this room and I have these
8:00
little stands and they're acrylic and clear so you can't really see them great but it's just uh like a little stand
8:07
that you can put any little figurines or anything else on but I'm gonna actually use it to put these pin cups on and then
8:16
I'm going to arrange all my new pins and everything that I'm using for plotting in this section then I have a section
8:22
with my colorful note cards colorful Post-it notes and that will go here I will also eventually be hanging some
8:29
shelves here and then I'll be decorating that part over there I also did clean off my desk but now it is no longer
8:35
perfectly clean and you can see I have kind of messed up the room a little bit more as I was getting some other things
8:41
ready to go so I will be doing sprints of manuscript then cleaning the room
8:46
management organizing the room and then I also want to spend a little bit of
8:52
time maybe only like 10 minutes just to get myself into it on the movement side of my writer reset and spend about 10
8:59
minutes working through one story question that came up while I was reading uh out at the coffee shop so
9:06
that's my plan for today so the eating part has been going really well and the
9:11
only problem is just some of the changes that I've made in my diet have meant kind of going through a detox phase from
9:18
more regular caffeine and from sugar and some other stuff like that and so I
9:24
think I've been a little bit more fatigued or tired than normal but I know that's just temporary so I'm just
9:29
hanging in there on that so yeah I'm excited I'm feeling the ideas and there's two other things that make me
9:36
aware that this is going really well so one is that I've been dreaming non-stop
9:41
at night and that is usually a sign that my creativity is coming back number two when I was in the shower this morning I
9:48
just started thinking oh but what am I going to do about such and such in in this book and talking about Vanessa and
9:54
I was like it just occurred to me that I my mind wandered off and that was what I was naturally thinking of and I know
10:00
that sounds like such a simple small thing but it's been so long since I just started daydreaming about my story that
10:07
I feel like I just lit up from the inside out because I was just like this
10:12
is exactly what I've been working toward and if I'm already seeing progress in just a couple of weeks imagine how I'll
10:18
feel in a couple of months so it gives me that momentum the excitement the pleasure the
10:24
the good feelings it's it's making me feel happy so let's go to a coffee shop and just keep amplifying those good
10:30
feelings
Coffee Shop Trip
10:36
[Music]
11:00
foreign [Music]
11:16
back at home but I'm not going to be able to follow through with the plan like I thought because we got a
11:22
violation for Andrew's hair being too long so we gotta go get his hair cut
11:27
he's got a baseball practice tonight and a game tomorrow and just some other things so uh yeah
11:35
my bad I should put it on my calendar it's like I plan so many things I need to plan his haircuts because his hair
11:40
grows so fast so we will be heading to get his hair cut in about 15 minutes so
11:47
I got four chapters done with lots of really good notes this book is a bit of a mess but all you can do when things
11:54
are you know you're reading back through it and you realize you have a lot of plot holes or you have a lot of issues
11:59
with the characters in mine I've got this one character has three different names because I renamed him multiple
12:05
times throughout the writing of the book so when you see there's a mess sometimes I think we want to just avoid it we're
12:11
like there's but there could be something brand new I could write that would be a lot more fun than this or this is just too hard and so I'm gonna
12:17
do I'm gonna make another video or I'm gonna do this other thing but if you want to finish the book The only way out
12:24
and the only way to get it done is to actually sit down and untangle the mess
12:29
step by step and so you know some people commented on the last video about like
12:35
like you know all these resets all the things you buy like none of it matters unless you get your butt in the chair
12:40
and you start writing and that is absolutely true but I did want to just make a statement that this isn't about
12:46
forcing myself back into the writing process this isn't about trying to become disciplined enough to like make
12:53
myself do it the writer Risa is about getting back to the joy and the flow and the excitement of the process and I
13:00
firmly believe that for my writing the thing that makes it so lovable and beloved by fans is the passion and the
13:07
story that I put into it and that's not to say that you can't create a great story by being disciplined and sitting
13:13
down every day but it is to say that we all have our own process and it's okay
13:18
to lean into what your process is so if you really resonate and you feel inspired by discipline and it's not
13:24
about waiting for inspiration or loving the process it's just about the discipline of sitting down in the chair and getting it done every day then find
13:31
your satisfaction with that but don't necessarily criticize anyone else who finds satisfaction in the pleasure and
13:39
the joy and the beauty and the stickies and the you know the plotting wall and the visuals I want to make my writing
13:46
fun I want to make it pleasurable and and exciting I don't want it to ever become a slog of like I forced myself to
13:54
sit down because that just doesn't resonate with me and we all have our own ways and our own paths and this is just
14:00
one of them and for me getting back to the Joy means not just being disciplined
14:06
enough to sit down and write which is always going to be part of it but wanting to come right excited cannot
14:13
wait to come and write to where I don't even have to be disciplined because I'm just so excited that's where I used to
14:20
be for years and years with my writing and so I know it's possible and I know that I can get there again but my life
14:26
has changed my circumstances have changed I have changed and so I'm finding my way back to that in you know
14:32
conjunction with the new life that I Live Now now and that's it's fun so what
Pens!
14:38
I'm going to do since I only now have about 10 minutes before we have to go is I'm actually going to do something that's fun and I'm going to take all the
14:45
pins I have this huge thing of 100 different colors of Crayola super tips which is what I like to use to write on
14:51
here because they won't bleed through to the wall and I'm going to fill them into here in
14:56
pretty colors as best I can and then we'll head out for the night and I will come back and get some more work done
15:03
when we get home this evening after I put the kids to bed so always have to be
15:08
flexible as a parent [Music]

A New Day
16:42
it's a new day so it is now Thursday and I'm realizing that it has taken me
16:48
longer this week to get things set up I've had more family things than I
16:53
expected so I still have not written so this week I was meaning to do 10 000
17:00
words and if I want to get this video up by Friday I'm probably not going to hit
17:05
that 10 000 but this weekend we have our quarterly virtual writing Retreat and I'm running Sprints for two hours from 9
17:13
to 11 p.m Eastern every night Friday Saturday and Sunday so my goal is to try
17:18
to get at least 2 000 Words Friday Saturday and Sunday so that'll be at least six thousand uh
17:25
6 000 words so if I want to hit the 10K I need to hit 4 000 words in other
17:30
people's Sprints and between today so I do want to get some writing done today because I do feel like I could procrast
17:38
a plan I could spend all this time like resetting working with my pins doing this kind of fun stuff and never getting
17:44
to the actual writing and there are a couple of scenes that I know what's going to happen so what I'm planning to
17:50
do at this point is continue to cultivate the joy and excitement for the things that are going but I'm also going
17:57
to work on some story questions today and I am going to actually get some writing done on some scenes that I kind
18:04
of already know what's going to happen and I think that'll be really fun it'll get me started because while it is fun
18:11
to do resets and to get ourselves back to Joy and sometimes we just need a break I've had a break from writing what
18:18
I need right now is to actually sit down and get some words on the page to start building my confidence back to start
18:25
building that routine back to get back into the story and so I'm doing a mix of all these things so I have successfully
18:32
set up all of my pins here and I love how this turned out I do
18:37
still have some dot markers and other things that are going to go into these cups but this is just a sweet little
18:42
Buffet of pins and all I have to do so the super tips are all at the top and then every other little cup is a
18:49
complete set so I have like the Emmett markers here and so on so I figure if I'm getting ready to work on like my
18:56
outline I can just grab the pins that most appeal to me out as a set and then
19:01
put them back when I'm done and I think that'll be fun and give me variety and everything else I also have like I said my note cards I have a little tape
19:08
dispenser here and so what I'm gonna do right now is I'm gonna move back to this plotting
19:16
wall and I'm gonna reset it so I'm gonna take all of these things that I printed
19:21
out all the pictures that I printed out as inspiration and I'm gonna put them up where they I kind of see them falling
19:28
here and I still have my uh Post-it notes that I had made previously that
19:33
I'm gonna put where I think they belong now on the new timeline now you can see this room is not completely finished I'm
19:41
still working on getting this room set up the way that I want it to be I still have blinds coming I haven't even fully
19:47
started using this computer or workspace yet but like I said if I wait for
19:53
everything to be perfect I'm never going to get started and I think that the more I delay the writing the more I will just
19:59
perpetuate that delay so I'm trying to find that balance between okay I'm
20:04
reigniting my joy but I'm also getting the work done too in a in a way that is fun and productive and joyful so that
20:10
this month doesn't pass me by without finishing the book so here we go I'm gonna do a little bit of this I also uh
20:18
worked on an outline yesterday and I got through the prologue chapter one chapter two chapter three so I'd like to get a
20:23
little bit more of that done today before I go to bed as well and I wrote
20:29
down a story question that came up just in those first four chapters on a sticky
20:34
note and so I'm going to spend at least 10 to 15 minutes on the treadmill this afternoon before my son gets home from
20:41
school just thinking through that no music in my earbuds no discussing it
20:47
with anyone else no reading no thinking of anything different I'm just gonna spend 15 minutes only thinking about
20:54
that story question and I'm gonna do a little bit of trial and error and see if
20:59
it's more productive for me to just walk and think or if it's more productive for me to walk and talk into my phone so
21:06
somebody asked me what am I using for text to speech or speech to text and I
21:11
just use Google Docs so I'll turn on the speech to text feature and I'll just dictate into it straight into a Google
21:17
doc that I will title like treadmill 420 and that works for me it's free it's
21:22
easy to use so I'll probably do that but that's a lot that I want to get done and it is almost two
21:30
I have been in meetings back to back to back all day long and so I'm going to make the most of this afternoon and
21:36
we'll see how far I can get
Being Productive

22:23
[Music]
22:31
[Music]
22:40
thank you foreign
22:51
there really was a ton of interest in doing a heart breathing's craft book
22:57
quarterly uh like book club so I will let you know more about that as Renee
23:03
and I sort of develop whatever we want to do but I will probably come up with
23:08
one of the books that I am planning to read and then we can give each other time to read it and maybe get on a zoom
23:14
call or something like that for those of you that want to do it or if we have like more than 100 people we'll figure
23:19
out another way to do a book club but I will keep you updated on that and what book and we'll do a poll and some other
23:25
stuff like that so now I am it's past 3 it's 3 20 so my son will be getting home
23:32
pretty soon so my plan now is to actually work with some note cards of
23:37
the ending of my story and then I'm going to write a little bit and that might be all I get to and unfortunately
23:44
it is thundering and it hasn't started raining but the clouds have rolled in so I'm like will there be a game tonight I
23:51
don't know but look how cute this is it's like I don't know if you can see that it's a little button that you can wear
23:58
that has my son's picture on it so I have been wearing this to the games and my husband
24:05
thinks I'm crazy because he's never seen anybody wear buttons of their kids to
24:11
baseball games but growing up in Georgia parents were always wore like families
24:18
always wore buttons of their kids like football players cheerleaders band like
24:23
anything that was having to do with the sport you were going to cheer on they wore especially senior year but you know
24:30
a lot of people wore them all the time I'm the only mom at the ball field who is wearing this so let me know in the
24:36
comments just kind of a totally random aside if where you live people wear
24:42
buttons or some other kind of photo of their player as they are practicing I
24:49
mean other people have to do it or they wouldn't have sold this as part of the package but anyway Andrew thinks I'm
24:55
being silly he's like Mom you're acting like I'm really good at this and I'm like it doesn't matter how good you are
25:00
if you're out there having fun I'm your mom and I'm gonna cheer you on and it's gonna be great but he's actually doing a
25:05
great job he's the only kid on his team that has never played before they've all been playing for years but they've won
25:11

25:17

25:25

Writing Time
25:33

foreign [Music]
26:06
it's about 4 30 we've gotta run I got two sprints in and they were both pretty
26:12
good but also pretty rough so I got a decent word count but I'm not in the flow and I'm not going to worry about it
26:19
I'm not going to stress about it because I know it's going to take time to get back into the flow and I wrote so when I
26:27
looked at my manuscript when I've stripped all the brainstorming and the
26:32
talking to myself stuff out of it I actually was only at 57
26:37
033 words in this current manuscript and then if you can see this I am now at 58
26:45
637 so the way I'm going to track this if it'll show up well on this camera is
26:51
I'm writing down here what was my start after Nano and then this is how I'm
26:56
going to track my Sprints I'm assuming or estimating that I'll finish the book in about 42 sprints
27:04
but I've given myself room for 64 and then if I need to I've got another page
27:09
here that I can use and I am just tracking the date each Sprint and how many words I wrote each one so I got 721
27:16
in my first Sprint and then 883 then I'm totaling those up for the day totaling those up for the manuscript and then how
27:23
many words to go based on an estimate of writing 85 000 words and I'm hoping to
27:28
start filling this in almost on a daily basis fingers crossed and I will also be
27:33
slowly filling in the plot I will share more tips on getting back into an older
Steps To Get Back Into A Book
27:39
manuscript as we move through writer reset but before we go I'm just going to
27:44
run through for you the basics of what I do and what is most helpful for me at
27:50
this stage so number one I usually print out the manuscript now this time there
27:56
was another step because I had written so much brainstorm I think I had almost 10 000 words in my manuscript 8 000
28:03
words something that was just brainstorming it wasn't really words or scenes it was just me talking through
28:09
what might happen in the story so that was my step one this time was to go through each chapter and strip out any
28:15
little brainstorming type things and move them into a separate document so I could see what I'm really working with
28:21
when it comes to my word count number two then was to print out my manuscript
28:26
number three is to go through and re-read the manuscript that I have
28:32
written and when I do this I have to come into it especially if my manuscript is a mess I have to come into it with a
28:40
mindset of we're here to fix the problems we're not here to judge where this is we're just here so I can keep
28:47
moving forward and the only way forward is to figure out where this is going I can't avoid it so I just need to get
28:53
into it because if I go into it with a mindset of this sucks I'm no good I'm not a good writer this is never going to
28:59
come together then it doesn't do me any good right so really I need to always make sure I sit down with that
29:05
manuscript to reread it with a mindset of I'm so proud of myself that I'm getting back into this I'm excited to
29:12
see the good parts of it and I'm not going to worry about the parts that are bad then what I do is I read through the
29:19
entire manuscript chapter by chapter and this does take time but I personally find that the time I spend on this is
29:26
like gold because it gets me back into the story if you have a story that you haven't Revisited for months or
29:33
potentially years you might not even remember some of the relationships some of the conversations some of the
29:39
dialogue some of the conflict that you wrote Into the story even if you had notes so it's helpful to go through and
29:46
actually make notes about this so I'll kind of show you what mine look like so this is what the manuscript looks like
29:52
and what I have done is I have marked whether this is past or present timeline
29:58
because I've got multiple timelines I also have gone through and made notes about anything that I might want to
30:05
change anything that stands out out on the page and has you know something I
30:11
either want to pull through like a thread or something that I might want to change or something like here I had some
30:18
descriptions of my character so I highlighted that or underlined it so I could write that in my outline just to
30:23
stay consistent because I've forgotten some of this stuff then at the end of each chapter I also wrote myself a note
30:30
like I kind of like this but here's some things that are going to change about it any of the present tense like current
30:35
timeline stuff I put this little arrow on so I could wreck you know see it recognize it right away any
30:41
inconsistencies that I started to notice already I started to Circle and
30:46
basically I'm just going through now this one I left a little heart for myself because I actually really liked
30:52
that statement and I try to encourage myself as I'm going through this of okay
30:57
this part was really good this has good moments it can be improved here I think here's how I think I could improve it
31:03
then alternately or at the same time simultaneously I I'm also going through
31:09
my planner and I'm writing out an outline so I read through it I take
31:14
notes when I'm finished with a chapter I come over here to my outline and I say chapter one she arrives at the cabin
31:20
she's unsure it's been a rough few years or one year because I keep debating on whether I want to make it two years in
31:26
the past or one year in the past so I have this just a quick little thing here
31:32
about what happened then I'm also integrating any of the character descriptions and things like that into
31:38
my character sheets over here so that I can remember those things and I will just take it one step at a time one
31:45
chapter at a time and go through it making any kind of notes now I like to leave my notes in color code so that as
31:52
I'm flipping through I can easily see this is a Lorelei chapter because she's purple so I'm going to make sure to take
31:57
notes on her chapters in purple and basically it's just going to be that
32:03
process right and then what I also will do is I'm going to create Post-it notes
32:10
right now I kind of already have them that correspond and those will go up on my wall if you're using index cards you
32:16
could also rewrite index cards with what's available in your story but what I find is that this process of getting
32:23
reacquainted really can't be skipped for me so if I have something that I have
32:29
not necessarily abandoned but have been away from for a while there is no
32:35
greater way to get back into the story than to reread it and for me actually printing it out putting pen to paper
32:42
putting my thoughts on the page is the most helpful thing because I'll I'll
32:47
certainly find right now I've only made it through the prologue in the first few chapters so I'm like 15 20 20 pages in I
32:54
certainly will find things that are great things that are terrible things I want to keep things I know I want to
33:00
throw away but I'll also remember the characters remember the dialogue remember all the issues that had come up
33:07
in the conflicts and I'll remind myself of this story and that is the best way to get me thinking about it because
33:13
it'll be top of mind again and that is the most powerful way to get back into a story after a break now like I said the
33:19
danger though is if you've been feeling down and feeling down on yourself because it's been too long away you feel
33:27
like you should have been working on it you feel like it's not as good as you remember that's where the mindset work really has to come in and you have to
33:34
keep reminding yourself or finding your ways to find joy in the process and say okay here's the parts that are really
33:40
good I know I can always improve the parts that are difficult because what I find is for sustainably being able to go
33:48
back to an old manuscript if I'm consistently coming into it with a mindset of I can't do this it's too bad
33:53
it's not as good as I thought I'm already in a less than ideal situation because I should have written this two
33:58
years ago you know whatever the more negative thoughts that come into it the less
34:04
likely I am to actually come in and finish this book because it's just gonna have a weight to it a heaviness a
34:10
negative like bad connotation but if I can come into it with an excitement and
34:17
this is something you can bring to it by choice you know of saying before I sit
34:22
down I am aware that this is not going to be perfect but I am so excited for the jewels and the gems and the hidden
34:29
things that I'm going to find that are going to be fun I'm welcoming the new ideas that will come that will help to make this a great book remind yourself
34:36
of the ways and the reasons that you loved this book in the first place so for me it's it's watching movies like I
34:43
Know What You Did Last Summer or going through and playing games like until dawn and sitting and thinking about why
34:49
I love this kind of murder mystery maybe even picking up a new one I never got a chance to finish a pretty dead pretty
34:55
dead Queens by Alexa Dunn so I want to go in and finish that book I'm also still finishing the last couple of books
35:02
of um good Girl's Guide to murder and those kind of stories which are similar vein to this I don't think any of those
35:08
have any paranormal elements like mine does but that gets me back into the why
35:14
eyes and the ideas of this genre and then their talent encourages me to keep
35:21
working on my own and all of this works together now sometimes when you're getting back
Final Thoughts
35:29
into a story it can be tempting to put yourself back on a timeline of okay I'm going to finish this book by you know
35:34
the end of the month whatever and I tend to do this too but just know that if you're struggling emotionally with this
35:41
is already behind Etc consider taking the timeline off of it and just saying instead of saying when it's going to be
35:47
done I'm going to commit to how much time I'm going to work on it this week or today or this weekend or whatever
35:53
that may be so that is the basics of how I get back into it so for me it's a
35:58
Synergy of I'm working on all these other aspects of my life bringing Joy back into my life while also reading the
36:05
craft books getting back into writing watching those games or watching those movies getting back into the games reading books that are fiction as well
36:12
and then following that outlining process and re-outlining the book and
36:17
then I'll go from there and I'll share that process with you guys as we go so that is my writer reset first Vlog I
36:24

37:40
right happy writer reset I will see you guys next week bye
I am a writer ever since 2010 I've made a really nice
0:08
living out of telling stories which still kind of blows my mind because it feels like such a gift to be able to do
0:14
what I do if I could go back in time and tell my very awkward past self that
0:20
someday she'll be able to make a living writing stories about witches and
0:25
magical worlds she would probably faint from excitement and yet here I am in the spring of 2023
0:35
having not released a full-length novel in almost two years
0:40
what's worse I've had almost no inspiration to write no characters talking in my head no late
0:47
night exciting epiphanies that leave me racing to the keyboard No Visions of the
0:52
scenes playing out in my imagination with rare exceptions most of my writing
0:58
has felt pretty forced it's time to admit that the stress of
1:03
the past few years has taken its toll and it's breaking my heart
1:09
so I figure I have a choice I can either give up Let The Fear win
Writer Reset Plans
1:14
and walk away from something I truly feel I was born to do and to be
1:20
or I can find my way back to my love and passion for writing
1:27
it's not really a choice is it I am a writer
1:33
and I choose Joy
1:45
writer reset I've been looking forward to this and in fact I actually started my writer reset at the beginning of
1:52
April and just didn't record some of that process because I personally needed a step back from social media to clear
1:58
my schedule to clear my mind and it was super helpful so if you've needed a sort
2:04
of digital detox I highly recommend it was very helpful for me and part of what I did during that time was I went really
2:12
deep in my own mind my own experience and I did a lot of journaling what's
2:17
been holding me back why am I struggling to get back into writing what is really
2:23
keeping me from getting words on the page or from feeling excitement or even thinking through my story at the times I
2:30
used to and I started thinking back to when my writing was at its best around 2017-2018 I was really really enjoying
2:37
it I wrote five books and published them in in 2018 it was my best year so I started thinking like what's different
2:43
now than that and and what can I do to create a better writing scenario for
2:49
myself right now and there are some things that I have realized along the way one is that I can't go back to the
2:57
way things were in 2018 exactly because I didn't have a daughter back then I had
3:03
one child he was in school all day and I think sometimes we forget how those big life changes that feel like everyday
3:10
life I mean she's just a part of our life and I wouldn't trade that for the world but sometimes I forget how much
3:16
time is dedicated to taking care of her and then second I didn't have this
3:21
YouTube channel I started it in 2018 but it was still a pretty small Channel back then I didn't have courses so that leads
3:29
me to one conclusion is that I am just naturally busier and I have more responsibility and I would bet a lot of
3:36
you feel the same way if you look at your lives but I don't want that to stop me I don't want that to be an excuse
3:42
because the other thing is my writing has suffered not just because I can't
3:47
find time for it because I actually have time for my writing it's in my schedule but for me you know they say you can't
3:55
pour from an empty cup you can't write when your brain is full of stress you
4:01
can't write from a place of stress and fear and anxiety or at least that's been the case for me and for me to sit down
4:08
and enjoy my writing and let the words just come to me and fly through the page it takes prep work so I know many of you
4:16
might be pantsers and you just kind of sit down and things come to to you as you write my writing process as many of
4:22
you are familiar with is a lot of pre-work it's a lot of daydreaming figuring out the plot figuring out a lot
4:28
of the twists and turns before I start writing and often it's a process of seeing those scenes happen in my head
4:35
and a lot of that pre-work happens in the shower or while we're talking when we're on walks or while we're out
4:42
gardening or doing anything like that and I haven't had the mental space to spend like time
4:50
in the shower daydreaming about my characters because I often spend that sort of non-busy time thinking through
4:58
problems like how can I keep my family safe or where are we going to move next
5:03
or you know how can I help everybody that has been emailing me or you know
5:08
all these different things and there have been multiple layers of ways that my life has changed in the last few
5:14
years and there have just been multiple layers of stress so it's not just about
5:21
making time for my writing it has to go deeper than that and I think that has
5:26
been part of the problem of not getting back into the routine of it is because I
5:31
can write and make a little note on my schedule that I'm going to write from 11 to 12 every single day and I could maybe
5:37
get a thousand words in there but if I sit down and there's no inspiration no ideas no characters talking to me none
5:43
of that I have nothing to write and oh for Nano I was able to prioritize my
5:50
writing a little bit more and spend more time with it but it still felt forced because it was like okay I've got a
5:55
video to make I have a word count that I have to hit and I've got to get these words in but it wasn't the inspired
6:02
overflow excited writing that really resonates with me that's the reason I do
6:08
this in the first place and I am determined I'm gonna get back to that so too much stress
6:14
too much on my plate a little bit of Life Changes we should say a lot of Life
6:21
Changes more responsibilities on my plate also brain fog so I have a
6:26
endocrine disorder called polycystic ovarian syndrome and it really does affect my ability to think clearly to
6:33
sleep well to not feel groggy in the morning anxiety depression brain fog pain all of that is part of PCOS and I
6:41
just haven't been really taking care of my health and making that a priority either so all of this to say that that
6:48
journaling came together and I identified some things that need to change in my life because instead of
6:54
trying to slot my writing into some time periods like little time slots like oh
7:00
I'm gonna do 30 minutes here and whatever I realize that I have to get back to a place of I'm excited to do
7:06
this and I'm fostering and nurturing ideas rather than being preoccupied with
7:12
my fears and that is not an easy thing to change about your life I feel like life in general has gotten so serious
7:19
over the past couple of years there's a lot of especially as we have lived so much of our life online as we've been
7:26
isolated from our communities it has been hard because there's not a single
7:33
comment section on a single Facebook post that doesn't have negativity criticism anger you know all of these
7:39
things and it really starts to weigh on me and I know many other people feel this way and it's not even I'm not even
7:46
just talking about my Facebook or Instagram posts I'm talking about you just read an ad for something and
7:51
there's like 50 000 comments where people are angry at this company for what they're doing or you know whatever
7:57
and it just it started to really weigh on me to be living my life in basically online
8:04
spaces and so I'm making some changes with that too and you know there's a saying what got you here won't get you
8:11
there and that has really been coming up for me because what got me to this place
8:16
where really and truly if I compared my life now to where it was you know even just five or ten years ago I'm living so
8:25
many of my dreams and sometimes as we live our day today it can be easy to
8:31
lose sight of just how far we've come and so practicing gratitude on a daily basis is really important for me right
8:37
now it's a practice that I have been really getting deep into and it's been helpful it's been bringing back my joy
8:44
to just acknowledge the ways in which I am really blessed and the things that I
8:50
love and you guys as my hearties community are a big part of that and I'm just really overflown with that
8:56
gratitude which then makes me feel excited to write but there are also some practical changes and some of this as I
9:03
go through it will not seem like these are writing related but I'm going to try my best to explain to you how they are
9:09
writing related and if you want to join me on this journey grab that workbook hang out with me there's going to be
9:16
several Vlogs coming up this first video is really all about my reasons like I've
9:21
just explained to you and the four sort of areas that I'm going to be focused on and what that's going to look like and
9:26
then every video after this will be a vlog which will be a little bit more like my nanowrimo Diaries kind of
9:33
explaining how my writing is going taking you on the journey to finishing my book The Disappearance of Vanessa
9:38
Shaw and showing you how I'm living these four areas and how they're
9:43
changing my life so I hope you enjoy it if you're new here I hope you'll subscribe and let's get into the four
9:49
areas and four ways that I'm changing my life to bring writing back to a place of
9:55
joy and passion
Writing Inspiration
10:00
try to go every these relatively quickly and then we'll dive into them deeper in the Vlogs but one is writing so the
10:07
first area is the writing itself right so I want to get back to a place where I'm thinking about my stories I'm
10:13
ruminating about my stories I'm sort of inviting The Muse to play with me again
10:18
um so part of that is sort of resetting some of my tools so I got this really cool purple case for my MacBook Pro I
10:27
also got this pretty purple and I realized that my nails match this week
10:32
too which was unintentional purple laptop sleeve I got a little purple Mouse as well a purple USBC Hub and a
10:41
new purple pin case and I've also gotten new pins
10:46
new index cards all of the tools that I use I have kind of gotten a refresh is
10:52
this necessary no but it's an easy relatively inexpensive way to sort of
10:59
remind myself and get excited for a fresh start which always is helpful for me so it's made it really fun it's made
11:06
everything feel fresh and new so that is the first part another part which ties
11:12
into the fourth section which is organization for me is that I am redoing my writing room so I'll Circle back
11:18
around to that because that is you know changing my environment my writing space I'm also on that sort of note gonna be
11:26
spending more time out at coffee shops and things like that and I am reaching
11:31
out to some friends that we're going to start meeting up for writing sprints on zoom in the mornings so it's a matter of
11:38
kind of getting my community around me I'll probably be spending more time in the writing Sprints Channel and getting
11:44
my tools set up you guys already saw that I set up my writing notebook that's
11:50
a traveler's notebook here and if you didn't see that video you can find it linked in the description excuse all my
11:55
lights behind me it's so much nicer when there's lights around but I am reset
12:01
adding my writing space my community kind of getting back in touch with people that I want to write with and I
12:08
can talk to stories talk through stories with my husband and I are also making writing dates where he's not actually
12:14
going to be writing with me but we are going to be taking walks with Evie and we're going to be spending at least an
12:20
hour a day going through and talking about different uh things that are happening in the story and I'm so ready
12:27
and excited for that if you saw one of my recent shorts here I also have a ton
12:32
of craft books that I have recently picked up or older ones that I read in the past or that I never got around to
12:39
that I'm going to be reading and that is also going to be helping me get my inspiration for writing back so many of
12:46
you said yes to a quarterly craft book book club so let's talk about that
12:51
coming up I will have more news on that coming up later but I have set aside time in my schedule to get back to
12:58
reading these books on writing and I think that's going to really help and I help the ideas flow creative play is
13:04
another piece of the puzzle that I'm going to spend more time gaming doing
13:09
puzzles just inviting The Muse back in instead of letting my mind be filled
13:15
with fears and scrolling Instagram and reading negative comments I'm going to be filling my brain with creative ideas
13:20
and stories told by other people through games and other books and fiction and different things like that so I'm hoping
13:27
it's going to be really fun music is another way that I'm bringing back my inspiration for writing is I've got
13:34
music set up in my bathroom and pretty much a speaker now in every room so that
13:39
we can play a lot of music and that just gets my mood up and having my mood in a better place really helps me get
13:45
inspired to write and to get things done so all of that is going to be helpful in getting myself back to a place of joy in
13:53
my writing okay number two is one I'm not gonna go
Eating Well
14:00
into as in detail but it is eating well and I know that any discussion about
14:07
food or eating can be triggering or difficult for some people so I have put chapters on this video and you are free
14:14
to skip to the next section so you don't have to hear anything about this so you can do that now
14:20
but for those of you that are interested in hearing wait why does eating well have anything to do with a return to Joy
14:27
right well it is complicated and I'm not going to go into all the mental issues
14:32
with me and food but what I will say is I have PCOS it is an endocrine disorder
14:39
it is a imbalance of hormones it is a metabolic disorder and it is directly
14:46
and very acutely affected by the foods that I eat and the substances that I put
14:52
into my body and over the past few years I have not been taking as good care of my body as I want
15:01
to and I also see the effects of that so it for me it manifests as more anxiety
15:09
it affects us sometimes depressive moods it affects me in terms of pain that I
15:15
really don't want to have to go through a lot of pain sometimes and then it also affects my sleep pretty seriously so
15:24
with PCOS many women like me deal with an imbalance of melatonin so melatonin
15:29
is supposed to kick in as the sun goes down so that you naturally want to fall asleep at a normal time and then it's
15:36
supposed to fade off you know before you wake up in the morning but with many women with PCOS that melatonin doesn't
15:43
kick in until the middle of the night and so it can be very difficult and you can feel very restless in the first few
15:48
hours that you're trying to get to sleep and then you fall asleep really hard and when you wake up in the morning because the alarm went off you still have 7
15:55
several hours that that melatonin is really high in your body so it can cause grogginess brain fog depression high
16:01
anxiety in the mornings and this is definitely something that very dramatically affects my daily life and I
16:11
know that there are ways that I can fix it or help it or make it not such a big problem but I haven't been doing those
16:18
things and there's a number of reasons that I won't get into but I will say that this is part of my writer reset is
16:25
getting back to a way of nourishing my body with supplements and with the types
16:31
of foods that I am eating and the foods that I'm no longer eating so that I can make sure
16:37
to get my hormones into as good a health as possible and it does surprisingly
16:43
greatly affect how well my brain works in terms of creativity and coming up
16:49
with ideas and how quickly I can make decisions how much use I get out of my
16:54
brain in the mornings like so many people will say oh you should get started on your writing in the morning before you do anything else but that is
17:01
actually not great idea or great advice for somebody like me who struggles with brain fog and anxiety in the mornings
17:08
sometimes I don't even feel good to go forward with the day until 10 o'clock in
17:13
the morning or later and so I'm ready to get to a different place with this so
17:18
that's pretty much all I'll say except that the things and the steps that I'm taking are I am meal planning in an Erin
17:24
Condren vertical planner that has three sections so I can say breakfast lunch and dinner I am prepping my meals every
17:31
Saturday and Sunday so Saturday we're going to be going grocery shopping as a family just so we can get everything
17:36
really quickly and kind of go out together to do something and the kids actually really like the grocery store
17:41
for some reason it's just fun to go to the HEB um and then I am prepping all of my
17:47
vegetables and my meals and fruits and everything and stocking up my fridge every Saturday and Sunday and that has
17:54
so far for the past couple of weeks been already pretty life-changing I have been
17:59
I would say kind of going through a detox phase from some of the things that I was consuming on a regular basis so I
18:06
have been more tired over the past couple of weeks but I'm feeling that energy start to return and I know from
18:12
looking back at that period where I was eating this way back in 2017 2018 that
18:19
the energy is going to come and energy really affects the amount of time and
18:24
creativity I have available to wear all these different hats YouTuber mom writer
18:30
you know all of those different things and so I'm looking forward to increased energy rather than fighting against my
18:35
body and so again this is not in any way to tell anyone else not a single soul
18:40
what I think you should do or anything like that this is just me sharing something that has made a big difference
18:45
in my life in the past and I am hoping that it will make a big difference for me again this year
Movement
18:52
thank you okay so how many of you write better when you have a chance to talk
19:00
through things with someone else so one of my top five strengths is communication and for me that often
19:08
means I gotta talk through my story I can't just think through it in my head and so one of the main things that I
19:14
like to do in that case is go for walks with my husband this is not quite the
19:20
same thing but there are a couple of other options even when he isn't available so we have
19:26
this new treadmill it is literally in the middle of our living room uh so which I don't care about it's just a
19:33
little corner here and there are different programs that you can do it has the iFit on it this is a Proform
19:40
Treadmill there are different programs that you can do so I have been doing some walking programs on here some of
19:46
them are guided so the person's talking through it and some of them are just
19:51
visuals and I can turn the I can turn the music down or whatever I want but
19:56
getting on the treadmill and moving my body and thinking through is more helpful than just sitting down in my
20:02
chair and thinking through my story and I know this about myself and yet I haven't been doing it consistently so
20:09
one is we're gonna start incorporating walks again in our family life so there
20:15
are covered places where we're not going to be in the hot sun I mean it'll be hot outside but we won't be in the direct
20:20
sun that we're gonna go on walks with Evie to start talking through my story so I'll have that time with my husband
20:27
to do that then on my own I'm also going to be using a microphone or the speech
20:34
to text on my phone into Google docs to walk on this treadmill and start talking
20:40
through my story questions so my plan is every time I have some kind of twist in
20:45
the plot or something I'm unsure about I'm going to write it on a sticky note or an index card and I'm going to write what the problem is what I'm trying to
20:52
figure out and then I'm going to get on the treadmill for 30 minutes and just walk in a normal like 3 3 3 miles per
20:58
hour Pace maybe a little bit of an incline and I'm going to talk through my ideas about this no matter how silly I
21:05
sound to anyone else in the house I sound silly right now because I'm talking to uh you know camera so it'll
21:11
be a similar type of thing and I'm going to try talking through my story ideas in
21:16
in that manner and we're gonna see how that goes but I think that that part of movement will be helpful the other thing
21:22
is I'm going to be spending more time outside so this is one of my favorite places in the house is this egg chair I
21:30
absolutely love it so I love to sit out here because I have this gorgeous just view of nature it's totally unobstructed
21:37
out here we don't have a lot of gardening going on yet but we have
21:43
started planting our first thing so we have a tomato here that's already starting to flower we have I think
21:48
broccoli and cauliflower in this bed and then we have I think cabbage and
21:54
zucchini here and another kind of squash maybe and then I forget exactly what
22:00
George planted in this one but I think that is zucchini actually there and then we have in this tub we have carrots all
22:07
of this is carrots but it has been really fun I have also planted some new rose bushes and some
22:13
new herb garden and then back here we have this is all our land back here and
22:19
we just have so much so all the way to the back of that building back there this is all our our land and eventually
22:26
we want to put a nice big Garden here but for now it's just full of wildflowers and it just has been
22:33
lovely to just come stand here at the fence and spend time out here walk through the area with my daughter
22:41
do some gardening with her pull up the weeds it just feels good to spend a
22:47
little bit of time out in nature instead of always being online and to understand that there is a life outside of
22:54
the online world where everything is so much in turmoil and there's so much
22:59
toxicity you know there's there's this there's peace there's Beauty in the world and I
23:06
can step outside of that and remember this and that's when I start to feel creative again
Organization
23:14
okay number four for me is organization so this again might seem like another
23:20
one of like how is organizing going to affect your writing but it really does because I have definitely
23:28
realized that when we first moved into this house we were all so busy that I just threw things in the nearest closet
23:35
and I didn't really organize everything in a way that was going to make it as usable easily accessible I didn't put
23:41
systems together it just takes a while to settle into a new house and I am
23:46
realizing that I waste a lot of time I feel a lot of anxiety I definitely have
23:53
that idea that when I walk into a room and something is messy it clutters up my
23:59
brain and I'm doing everything I can to get rid of all that clutter in my brain all of the mess in my life make things
24:07
as easy as possible make the visual noise as toned down as possible so I
24:13
read the book goodbye things and even though I am not a minimalist and I don't
24:18
agree with everything that he has to say about color and things like that I really found this book to be super
24:25
useful because in it he talks about this idea that as we walk around our homes every single item has a message for us
24:32
and the more neglected something is the louder its message is and I have found that to be true that I walk in here and
24:39
I see that there's stuff all over this couch and not only does it make me feel a certain way about the type of person I
24:46
am it makes me feel judgmental towards myself but it also makes me feel unsettled like it's time to get your
24:52
stuff together it makes me feel a little bit chaotic disorganized and it takes up
24:58
my attention it also prevents me from using the couch in a way that might be helpful for my writing so that is just a
25:06
glaze over the top of it but it is the reason that organizing has become a part
25:11
of my writer reset so I'm starting in this room or actually I started in the
25:17
bathroom of my main master bathroom so I'm gonna throw in a clip here of what I
25:23
did because I'll show you kind of the state of what my bathroom looked like when I got back from The Mastermind that
25:30
I went to because it was just such a mess and every day when I would put on my makeup I would have to pull everything out of
25:37
different places and then it would stay there for convenience sake because I didn't have a system so I ended up
25:42
taking literally everything out of every cabinet every drawer putting it all out on the floor I ended up throwing away
25:48
like two bags full of stuff donating an entire box full of stuff and then reorganizing my entire bathroom in a way
25:55
that allows me to keep it clean because everything has a place and sometimes it
26:01
can feel a little shameful to admit that I'm not a super tidy like naturally tidy person but I do know that I feel better
26:08
when my bed is made when my bedside table is clean and clear so I can put a
26:14
nice you know glass of water on there in my book when this writing space has a
26:20
certain kind of vibe to it and it feels like a creative space when my writing space is chaotic and messy and there's
26:27
stuff everywhere and I can't find my note cards I just feel like I can't create and so making this space as nice
26:34
as possible is part of my writer reset so next week I'll share a little bit more of this but I have plans for this
26:41
entire room I'm actually going to be reorienting this plotting board and I'll show you a little bit more about that I
26:47
have blinds coming for this so I'm taking this curtain down and I'm going to be putting like a shade in here so
26:53
that I can control the lighting you can see that I did put up some new monitors I have my super cute new keyboard that I
27:00
got for Christmas and I completely built a brand new PC from the ground up uh I
27:06
don't know a month and a half ago that I haven't really even gotten into using yet because I haven't been using this space but this is all to create a better
27:15
environment for my brain and creativity in this room and it won't just be this room but I'll I'll show a picture of my
27:23
before for this closet but over the past couple of weeks I have really been working to get this space organized too
27:29
like look how awesome this space is and I put these Walmart bookcases here and I
27:35
have these little shoe bins that fit six to a shelf and it has really been
27:41
helping me get this organized and make it where everything is just a quick pull out and use rather than things in boxes
27:48
on top of each other where I couldn't really access it as quickly as possible and so part of my goal is to make the
27:55
whole house this organized so I can really access everything I don't have
28:02
this invisible to-do list as he talks about in the book and instead I feel really settled and safe and clean and
28:09
organized and then hopefully my brain and my thoughts will also be organized
My Goals
28:15
[Music] so how am I organizing or integrating this with hb90 you can see I have my
28:22
boards reset for Q2 and I have way more stickies on goal number one than I do on
28:30
goals two and three but here's how I am sort of integrating it if you're new to
28:35
my channel these boards represent my three goals for the quarter then every sticky note represents a task that I'm
28:42
going to complete in a project that I think will help me hit my goals and then as I do them I move them to the doing
28:48
section and then once they're done they go to the bottom so this first goal is my writing goal and this is the writing
28:55
part of the writer recess so this is the craft books it's also completely re-uploading and refreshing my website
29:02
and all of my books as well as writing The Disappearance of Vanessa Shaw and hopefully editing it and getting all
29:07
that done I'm also going to start doing some promotions for my books again because I haven't been doing any promo I
29:14
haven't really been focusing on so social media so it's just kind of Reviving The momentum of that career but
29:20
you can see this is my goal for heart breathings and usually this is the most full of all of them and I have
29:27
intentionally created space and cut down on my projects there so I'm mostly just focusing on my Instagram my YouTube
29:34
channel and then the hb90 course that will run in June and that's pretty much
29:39
the whole Focus here and then this third goal is really where writer reset comes
29:44
into play so all of those other things like the organizing the eating well the movement all of that is integrated into
29:51
this third goal and that is how I am really pulling it through is really goals one and three this is my writing
29:59
goal this is sort of my writer support writer reset goal and then I have heart breathings there in the middle and I'm
30:04
pretty excited you can see I've already started making some progress on some of these goals but the big one is you know
30:10
it's all fine and good to do a big writer reset but none of it counts unless I actually start writing so my
30:17
goal now that we're about halfway through the month of Camp is to start writing next week and I'm hoping to
30:22
write 10 000 words next week and I will share that in my next Vlog so those are
Final Thoughts
30:28
are my writer reset plans and you'll see them in more detail and actually in
30:34
action next week and for the next several weeks where I'll be sharing the actual writing actual setting up of my
30:41
room how I'm integrating movement and other things organizing and everything else to hopefully not just create cracks
30:50
of space where I can kind of squeeze my creative moments in but to nurture The
30:56
Muse to come back into my life to get back to my true identity my true joy and
31:03
passion for writing because you know 13-year career making a living at this I
31:10
wish I could say it was all just this uphill trajectory but it really has just been ups and downs and I love writing
31:18
but living a creative life sometimes can be difficult in such a noisy polarized
31:28
critical World especially an online world and I just want to share this
31:34
process with you not only to show you what I'm doing and hopefully give you ideas if you've been in the same place
31:39
but also to just take a moment to encourage you that if there is something that you keep coming back to that you
31:47
love that you have wanted to put your heart into and it either has been put to
31:54
the Wayside due to life circumstances or too much criticism negativity fear
32:00
anxiety has made it difficult to create or some other event has stolen the joy
32:08
for a while or whatever the case may be if you have some reason that you have
32:14
drifted away from a passion that you feel like is a part of you I just want
32:19
to encourage you to say that it's never too late to come back to it it's never too late to try again to change what
32:27
your situation is your environment the way that you spend your time or where
32:33
your priorities are it's never too small of a step I'm taking some big leaps but
32:38
you could do this in the tiniest of increments just taking five minutes a day to get back to allowing yourself to
32:44
daydream about your story or your art or whatever it is you're creating sometimes I think it takes reminding
32:52
that in this busy world where sometimes it can feel like there's so much going on in the world
32:59
there's so much tragedy there's so much pain there's so much difficulty in the world what's the point of creating like
33:06
why should I make this silly rom-com or why should I make this book about witches or you know what does my writing
33:12
have to do when there's all these other big Global issues and I know that sometimes that can be what holds us back
33:19
from our writing too is you know what difference does it make or who what do I think I am spending time in this fantasy
33:25
world when there are real world problems going on but I just want to encourage you by saying that it is okay to take
33:32
the time that you need to take care of yourself to nurture your own soul your own creativity your own art because the
33:39
world needs those things now more than ever and I truly believe that the best
33:44
way to solve so much of the pain and anxiety and angst and and other things that are going on in the world is to
33:51
Center back into your own joy and that Joy becomes so powerful because we can
33:58
just see how negativity tends to spiral down and I think it's no mistake
34:05
or no coincidence that we're seeing more and more people with anxiety and
34:10
depression than ever and I just want to tell you that your joy your personal Joy
34:18
matters so much in the world right now and it is okay despite all the things going on to take a moment for yourself
34:24
and say this is the thing that I love this is who I was meant to be and I'm going to make it a priority and that is
34:31
how I'm going to make a difference in this world and I know that that can sound really cheesy but I know there's some people that need to hear this that
34:38
our individual Joy are calling our purpose sometimes to create might seem
34:44
Superfluous but it is actually essential and so I encourage you to tell your
34:49
stories to get your art out there in whatever form it is whether it's writing books or painting or poetry or whatever
34:56
it is that you do the world needs you right now more than ever and you need
35:01
you and that is a big part of what my journey is this year year is to truly learn
35:07
to love myself enough to make the things that I love most a priority in my own
35:13
life and these are the steps that I'm taking to make that happen I miss my
35:18
writing I miss the passion and the excitement and the way the world's words flow and the way the ideas come and the
35:24
twists and turns and I am so hoping that these steps is gonna be the key to
35:30
unlocking that again for me so thanks for coming along on this journey if you're new Please Subscribe if you

oh my goodness I am so glad to be home
0:03
but I had an incredible experience
0:06
flying out to San Diego for a few days
0:08
last weekend to get to meet with my
0:11
long-term friend and business Mentor
0:13
Amber McHugh and some of my other
0:15
business besties and it was so much fun
0:18
and so amazing but
0:21
anytime I take time off and get out of
0:24
routine either for a vacation or a
0:27
conference or something that I am
0:30
strategizing about my career or anything
0:32
like that it can be difficult to get
0:34
back into routine back into my regular
0:37
energy when I get home so I thought I
0:39
would make a quick little video sharing
0:42
with you sort of how I'm getting back on
0:44
track to finish up camp nanowrimo and
0:47
keep working on my novel even after a
0:49
conference or vacation or a break so
0:52
let's get started
0:53
[Music]
0:57
this trip was definitely filled with a
San Diego Trip
1:01
lot of inspiration and I ended up
1:03
extending my stay an extra day because
1:06
we had the Airbnb and we were right on
1:08
the beach in Mission Beach I did Vlog
1:10
some of this by the way so I will have a
1:11
video coming up in a little bit about
1:13
that but when I got home I was exhausted
1:18
I definitely did not get as much sleep
1:20
out there there's a slight time
1:22
different change it's a two hour time
1:24
difference and I missed my kids and as
1:27
soon as I got home it was baseball game
1:30
date night my husband's birthday my best
1:32
friend flew in from Charlotte there were
1:34
a lot of things going on so here it is
1:36
Friday I'm gonna record and edit and get
1:38
this out today I hope just kind of
1:41
trying to get my sea legs so to speak
1:44
I'm just trying to get back into my
1:46
routines because even though I did and
1:49
always do build some buffer around
1:52
conferences especially
1:54
I still have to get myself back on track
1:58
and my energy has still been lower than
2:01
I expected it to be which you know is
2:04
understandable I find that sometimes
Why It’s Tough
2:06
vacations are not as restful as we want
2:08
them to be but sometimes even getting
2:11
back from a restful vacation there's
2:12
things to do like laundry and cleaning
2:15
up the house like every time I go away I
2:17
have this expectation of myself that I'm
2:19
going to like clean the house so that
2:21
when I come home everything's like
2:23
perfect and pristine but it never works
2:26
out that way every single time I'm like
2:28
scrambling at the last minute to get
2:29
everything packed and I end up leaving a
2:32
mess everywhere then I have to unpack
2:34
everything and get back into routine and
2:36
all of that takes time and energy after
2:39
a trip away and so I'm gonna just sort
2:42
of talk through and this will be a
2:43
little bit of a chatty potentially
2:45
rambly video I'm gonna talk through the
2:48
steps that I've taken to get myself back
2:50
to a working weekend because I've got to
2:52
be working on my book a little bit I'm
2:54
excited to work on my book this weekend
2:55
and how I'm preparing for a day one
2:58
coming up on Monday where I'm going to
3:00
be hopefully just zipping right back
3:02
into routine now a word about
3:05
conferences in particular if you've ever
3:08
been to a writing conference or a work
3:10
conference I feel like these are the
3:12
more difficult types of events to get
3:14
back in a routine vacation sure you do
3:17
the laundry you get a little bit of rest
3:18
and then you get back into work but with
3:21
conferences our brains are just so
3:23
filled with information and strategy and
3:26
things that we want to implement and
3:28
things that we want to do and so I have
3:30
a special sort of workflow or get back
3:33
into routine flow when it comes to
3:35
conferences or masterminds or Retreats
3:38
where I'm going to be with people and
3:40
strategizing about my future and
3:43
speaking of conferences I've had a lot
3:46
of people ask me Sarah what conferences
3:48
do you recommend for authors out there
3:50
and one of the best in the industry that
3:53
is a don't miss is in anchorscon it is
3:55
run by Alessandra Torre she is a
3:58
massively successful multiple New York
4:00
Times best-selling author and inkerscon
4:03
always has a reputation for having some
4:05
of the best speakers in the industry and
4:07
they actually have two versions of their
4:10
conference there's an in-person
4:11
conference here in Dallas which I didn't
4:13
get to go to because it was my son's
4:15
birthday and we had other plans but I
4:16
will be going next year I hope and then
4:18
they also have a virtual conference and
4:21
this conference has I believe over 25
4:24
amazing speakers that you can watch at
4:26
your own pace just whenever you get a
4:28
chance so you don't have to just have
4:31
what we call conference head and come
4:33
back from an event instead you get to
4:35
pace yourself which is really really
4:36
helpful but there are some Live Events
4:39
too like author roundtables q and A's
4:41
and there's a planning event which of
4:44
course you know I'm all in for and hope
4:45
to participate in where you can really
4:47
map out your strategy for the next six
4:50
months or so in your author career so if
4:53
that sounds good to you and and you want
4:54
to join me at anchorscon this year
4:57
Alessandra and the team at anchorscon
4:59
have offered our community 50 off their
5:02
already reasonable conference fee for
5:04
the virtual conference coming up it
5:07
starts just over a week I believe July
5:09
22nd is their big kickoff event but like
5:12
I said even if you are available that
5:14
week to go through each individual
5:16
session right away you'll you're going
5:18
to have access to these videos for a
5:20
long time to come so if you're
5:21
interested in reading more I will put
5:23
all of that down in the description box
5:25
and to get that 50 off you just use the
5:28
code sarah23 and remember Sarah is with
5:31
a double r s a r r a two three and I
5:34
will see you there let me know if you're
5:36
going to do it maybe we could do a post
5:38
increase con Hardy's event or something
5:40
like a live stream or q a to kind of
5:42
talk about what we learned these types
5:45
of author conferences masterminds
5:47
Retreats and events can be pivotal in
5:50
our career can really help us to level
5:52
up and go to the next like really open
5:55
our mind to the next level of what we
5:57
need to do for our author career but
5:59
like I said sometimes coming back from
6:01
these conferences like be speaking at
6:03
nink in September I did Ram last year
6:05
sometimes we might do two or three
6:07
events like this or more for some of you
Get Back To Routine
6:10
throughout the year so how do you come
6:12
back and get back into routine so I'm
6:14
just going to walk you through some of
6:15
what I like to do so thank you to
6:18
everybody first of all who watched my
6:20
setup for this binder I love somebody
6:22
suggested Sage planner for Sarah Andrew
6:25
George and Evie and I actually just met
6:27
someone this weekend named Sage that I
6:29
adored so I might call this my sage
6:31
planner but I also liked the idea of
6:34
just calling it a family planner or a
6:37
Home planner there were a lot of really
6:39
good ones some people called it home
6:40
base which I really loved especially
6:42
because my son is in baseball right now
6:44
so thank you for all those suggestions I
6:46
took one of my new list pages from this
6:49
and I just created a brain dump just
6:52
list so that's one of the first things
6:54
that I do because I tend to come back
6:56
from conferences or vacations feeling
6:58
like there's so much to do that it's
7:00
overwhelming and a tried and true
7:02
strategy for me when I'm overwhelmed is
7:04
to just write it all down because nine
7:06
times out of ten there's not as much
7:09
there as I think and if I can just break
7:11
it down into manageable steps I start to
7:14
breathe a little easier and I start to
7:16
get myself into action and into a plan
7:19
so my list says things like get the
7:22
laundry done unpack clean the bathroom
7:24
clean up and tidy my bedroom get my
7:28
offices ready to go for a reset that
7:30
kind of thing another thing that I love
7:32
to do besides uh like to-do list
7:34
brainstorm is I like to set aside a
7:37
couple of hours especially after a
7:39
conference or a time with friends to
7:41
strategize and really write down all of
7:44
my takeaways from the event
7:47
I have skipped this step in the past and
7:49
really regretted it because it tends to
7:52
just be noise in the back of my brain
7:54
like oh yeah I remember when they said
7:55
that plus I want to capture all of my
7:58
thoughts when they're still fresh this
8:00
time I had a two and a half hour plane
8:02
ride home and so I spent a lot of that
8:05
plane ride on my iPad just journaling
8:07
about it and actually the guy sitting
8:09
next to me was like that's a really big
8:11
uh Journal there that you're using big
8:14
expensive journal and it's like yes he's
8:16
like I would be using that for a TV and
8:18
I did actually watch a couple videos as
8:20
well but yes I used my iPad and good
8:23
notes as a journal to get all those
8:24
thoughts out about everything that uh
8:28
really stuck with me about the
8:29
conversations that we had and the things
8:31
that we did it can be helpful to journal
Lists
8:33
all those takeaways and to make a list
8:36
of things that I want to take action on
8:38
now like things I want to change or
8:40
strategize or decide versus the things I
8:42
want to put in my future parking lot so
8:45
this is a concept that I also got from
8:47
Amber McHugh years ago she calls it the
8:49
million dollar parking lot which is a
8:51
place where you can take the ideas that
8:52
you don't have time for now but you
8:54
don't want to forget and just list them
8:56
out and so this is in the hb90 planner
8:59
there is a future ideas parking lot or a
9:01
space in the planner for you to put down
9:04
ideas that you can't take action on now
9:06
because of time or circumstances are you
9:08
just not ready but you can hold them and
9:11
it kind of tells your brain like okay
9:13
Beach Hill we took care of this idea now
9:16
you can just you know revisit that in
9:19
the future so I like to do that
9:21
post-conference like what are the things
9:22
I can take action on now and what are
9:24
the things that go into my future idea
9:25
parking lot that I can deal with next
9:27
quarter or the quarter after that and
9:29
that gives me a little bit of peace of
9:30
mind and peace in general
9:33
the next thing that I do besides just
9:36
like loving on my family because I
9:38
really miss my kids it's hard to be away
9:40
from them for three or four nights so I
9:42
just loved them up Andrew had a baseball
9:44
game and won and we spent a lot of time
9:46
with George for his birthday and it has
9:48
just been wonderful so besides that I
Decide on Day 1
9:51
also like to decide on day one and what
9:54
I mean by that is when I come back now
9:58
some of you might be great at coming
9:59
back from something and just getting
10:01
into action back into routine day one my
10:04
husband is like that he can come back do
10:06
his laundry that night wake up the next
10:08
morning like he was never gone like
10:10
ready to go back into routine because
10:12
he's just very much a creature of habit
10:14
I am not like this so your mileage may
10:18
vary here depending on your own
10:19
personality but I am somebody who I tend
10:23
to just be at rest and I need a lot of
10:26
rest after vacations and in fact
10:29
I think that for me there's a balance
10:31
between rest and listening to your body
10:34
which is so important like listen to
10:35
your body take the rest that you need
10:37
and getting into action because I have a
10:42
PCOS body that I was just recently
10:44
diagnosed with obstructive sleep apnea
10:46
so if I do nothing but listen to my body
10:48
when it tells me to rest I would do
10:50
nothing but rest like all the time
10:52
forever and so I do also need some kind
10:55
of momentum and motivation to get myself
10:57
back into aligned like action and
11:01
routine otherwise I'll just rest forever
11:03
and so I've kind of decided over the
11:06
last couple of days checking in with
11:08
myself do I feel like getting back into
11:10
things yet and obviously today I'm
11:12
recording this video but I canceled my
11:14
coffee chat with my Sarah Cannon so it's
11:16
a little bit of a half Working Day and
11:19
so what I've decided is day one for me
11:21
meaning the day that I will get back to
11:23
what I consider my morning routine and
11:25
be at 100 is going to be Monday and for
11:28
me that's almost an entire week of break
11:31
and that's okay because I needed it and
11:35
it has been really good for me to just
11:37
ease my way back in but it's also super
11:39
helpful for me to say this is my day one
11:42
and I'm gonna prepare myself mentally
11:44
emotionally prepare my space so that
11:46
Monday morning I sit down and everything
11:48
is prepared I want to have so this is
11:51
all on my list here I want to have my
11:53
week three planned for Q3 I want to have
11:56
my meal plan and groceries I want to
11:58
have my spaces cleaned up and then once
12:00
I've picked that day one I ease my way
12:02
into getting all those tasks done
12:04
without feeling frantic or panicked
12:06
about it I just kind of enjoy it and
12:08
take my time with it so yesterday what I
12:10
did was I tackled some of the things
12:12
like putting away my makeup tidying up
12:14
the bathroom tidying up my office so
12:17
here's a little look at how that went

Listen To Your Energy
14:04
so today I'm getting a video out for
14:06
heart breathings but listening to my
14:08
energy I canceled my Sarah Cannon video
14:11
and that's okay not always going to be
14:13
ideal but sometimes when we come back
14:15
from Vacations or we've been off routine
14:17
we just need to take a little break and
14:19
give ourselves a little bit of extra
14:21
breathing room and that's what I did and
14:23
I am proud of myself for doing that and
14:25
I'm honoring myself for doing that even
14:27
if it disappoints other people I'm
14:29
recovering people pleaser and I'm proud
14:31
of myself for being able to do that and
14:33
I know 100 that my fans have my back
14:36
over there and I can feel really good
14:38
about it so kind of letting go of the
14:40
things that you promised when you need a
14:43
little extra rest is a big step forward
14:45
for me in getting back into routine now
14:49
back into routine right now also means
Camp NaNo Update
14:52
Camp nanowrimo so I wanted to update you
14:54
on my writing plans I usually am not
14:58
someone who can go away to a conference
15:00
or an event and get my normal writing
15:03
done so I worked that into my plan for
15:05
Q3 but I wasn't expecting to basically
15:09
lose all of this week so I'm a little
15:11
bit behind where I intended to be if
15:14
you've been watching my videos you know
15:15
that for camp nanowrimo in July I was
15:18
hoping to have The Disappearance of
15:20
Vanessa Shaw completely finished so that
15:21
I could put it up for pre-order in
15:23
August
15:24
it's not looking so good but I'm just
15:26
gonna do the best I can and not add
15:28
additional stress to myself I will say
15:30
that my accountability partnership with
15:33
my husband where I am setting a deadline
15:35
with him and then if I make it I get
15:37
paid if I don't make it I have to pay
15:38
him then that has been working so I
15:41
turned in act one on time it's about the
15:44
first 19 to 20 000 words of my book and
15:46
he said it was amazing which trust me he
15:49
has told me many times before when he
15:51
didn't think it was quite there so it
15:53
means a lot that after a bit of a
15:55
writing Hiatus he really thinks it's
15:57
great so I'm encouraged to keep moving
15:59
forward so we have also set a deadline
16:01
for me to like we said a mini deadline
16:04
because I didn't feel after the break
16:06
that I was ready for okay let's turn in
16:08
the next 20 000 words so we worked it
16:11
backwards a little bit and we have a
16:13
mini deadline that Sunday by 9 00 PM I
16:16
need to turn in an outline of the scenes
16:19
this is just a list of the scenes that
16:21
I'm going to include in act two part one
16:24
so this is about the next 20 to 24
16:27
000 words of the book and all I have to
16:29
do is have a list of the scenes that I'm
16:31
going to include which means over the
16:32
next couple of days I need to find some
16:35
time to really sit down and focus on
16:37
which scenes from my rough draft I'm
16:39
going to be using in that final or the
16:42
next version of edits and get that done
16:45
then at that point we will set our next
16:47
deadline based on how I feel those
16:49
scenes are in shape I have a feeling
16:51
right now what we'll do is by next
16:54
Friday at 9 00 PM I will be turning in
16:57
the next
16:58
20 000 words but we'll see we'll set
17:01
that deadline on Sunday night but this
Set Mini Deadlines and Goals
17:03
is another thing that can be helpful to
17:05
get yourself back on track is if you
17:07
have a big goal that you feel like
17:09
you're a little behind on and you're
17:11
trying to get back into routine
17:13
sometimes it can be helpful to step that
17:15
goal back a little bit and give yourself
17:17
a mini goal that you can reach for in
17:20
the next couple of days instead of
17:21
saying by the end of the month I'm gonna
17:22
have this big thing done it can be
17:24
motivational to say okay by Tuesday
17:26
afternoon I'm gonna have this little
17:28
piece of the goal finished and that can
17:30
help you build back your momentum
17:32
another thing before we go is just
Ground Your Vision
17:36
another idea that can work is to revisit
17:39
if you've ever made a vision board in
17:42
one of my classes or just on your own
17:43
revisit your vision get grounded again
17:47
in the things that you're trying to
17:48
accomplish what are my goals for this
17:50
month what are my goals for this quarter
17:51
what's due what's coming up due soon
17:54
what can I push back do I need to make
17:56
extra room and just kind of give
17:58
yourself a little bit of a review and a
18:00
Refresh on what you're trying to
18:02
accomplish why it's so important to you
18:05
and do you need to create a little bit
18:07
of extra space and just giving yourself
18:09
permission to not be like I have to
18:12
follow the plan because I think the
18:14
thing that holds me back or has held me
18:16
back most in the past when I get off
18:18
routine is that I start to panic that
18:21
I'm going to be behind and I'm letting
18:22
people down and that negative energy
18:24
tends to spiral and it sends me into
18:27
even more negative energy more panic and
18:30
I end up wasting time and energy on
18:32
things that a year later really didn't
18:35
matter all that much so I encourage you
18:37
if you have been on a break and you're
18:39
getting back on track give yourself a
18:41
little bit of space pick your day one
18:43
and ask yourself what do I need to get
18:45
done to make day one feel really good is
18:47
it getting my meals in order my
18:49
environment my space in order do I need
18:52
a little bit more rest do I need a
18:54
self-care day what do I need to get
18:56
ready for Day One Pick that day one and
18:58
then and set many goals for yourself
19:01
remind yourself of why you're doing this
19:03
and why it's important to you to get
19:05
this work done and then just dive back
19:07
in the final tip of course is to not be
19:10
hard on yourself if you hit day one and
19:13
it really is only a half energy day
19:14
still because sometimes we need a little
19:16
bit more time and it's okay to say okay
19:18
day one I got three out of ten things on
19:21
my list day two let's try to aim for
19:23
four and slowly build yourself back into
19:26
your writing routine because sometimes
19:28
even just three or four days out of
19:30
routine can kind of set us off
19:32
but off balance a little bit for quite a
19:35
bit of time so all right that's all I

[Music]
20:49
thank you
okay so i am heading out
0:27
to do a little bit of shopping
0:29
and sometimes this is how i get back
0:31
into my
0:32
novels is i go shopping and i get all
0:35
the tools and all the fun stationary
0:38
things that i need to get started so
0:40
let's go
0:42
[Music]
1:07
[Music]
Getting Excited
1:36
okay so we did a little bit of shopping
1:38
today i'm going to show you exactly what
1:40
i picked up at target but for me
1:42
whenever i'm trying to get reconnected
1:45
to
1:46
a story that i've taken a little bit of
1:48
a break on it sometimes it's something
1:51
that i've taken a break on for
1:53
a month or two and sometimes it's a
1:55
story that has been a couple of years
1:57
that's been sitting there so i do have a
1:59
story that i'll be working on hopefully
2:01
later this year that i haven't worked on
2:03
since i was pregnant with evie back in
2:04
2019 so that will have potentially a
2:07
different process to get back into after
2:10
so long but here's what the basic
2:13
process looks like i find that when i'm
2:16
getting back into a story especially if
2:18
i've had a break completely from writing
2:20
altogether
2:21
i have to mentally get myself excited
2:24
for the process so this part might seem
2:27
completely superfluous for those of you
2:28
that really would rather just like why
2:31
don't you just sit down and start
2:32
writing that's totally fine if that's
2:34
what you prefer to do but i thought i
2:35
would share my true process just in case
2:38
it sparked something for you but for me
2:40
i need a day of getting myself excited
2:43
again for the project and for me if
2:46
you've been around on this channel for
2:47
any length of time you know
2:49
that means getting my tools together my
2:51
stationery getting all my like supplies
2:54
together starting to get really excited
2:56
sometimes it also means running errands
2:59
and getting things off my brain and off
3:01
my to-do list that have been sitting
3:02
there for quite a while so for example
3:05
one of those is that i have this dji
3:08
pocket to creator i used this for all of
3:11
my vlogging during nanowrimo and then
3:13
evie put this gimbal in her mouth that
3:16
got the whole thing messed up and so
3:18
it's just been a dead
3:19
500 camera sitting in my closet since
3:22
november and i did have the geek squad
3:25
protection on it but i just hadn't gone
3:26
to get it done so that's like one of the
3:28
things plus i had some things i need to
3:30
mail out i had some stuff i needed to
3:31
get from the grocery store we've been in
3:33
quarantine for two weeks
3:35
i also have been wanting to get some new
3:37
workout gear i have officially lost 30
3:39
pounds since this time last year and i'm
3:42
starting to get wanting to get back into
3:44
kind of working out and we're going to
3:45
be moving into our new house and that
3:46
means
3:47
like lots of space to be running and
3:50
we're going to be out in nature it's
3:51
going to be awesome so i got some new
3:53
workout gear none of that stuff is
3:55
directly related to my writing but it's
3:58
just a matter of like i have that to-do
4:00
list and everything's getting checked
4:01
off so that i feel i'm building positive
4:04
momentum of i'm getting things done i'm
4:07
getting ready to be productive again and
4:09
i'm kind of waking myself up if that
4:12
makes sense so let me show you some of
4:13
the tools that i got this is a
4:15
combination of things that i already had
4:17
and some things i kind of replenished to
4:20
get started on the books now i will go
4:23
ahead and just preface this by saying if
4:25
you're new here i am currently writing a
4:27
series that has four main points of view
4:30
and then there will also be like two to
4:32
three points of view in this particular
4:34
book that are
4:36
uh main pov characters but only have a
4:38
handful of chapters and i like to
4:41
make sure that i color code all of my
4:43
story notes my index cards everything
4:46
according to those main especially those
4:48
main four points of view
4:51
when i am choosing what colors i'm going
4:53
to use for a color code one of the first
4:55
things i do is instead of trying to just
4:57
pick the colors that i like or that i
4:59
feel represent those characters is i
5:01
make sure that i'm choosing things that
5:03
are easy to find so for example if
5:06
you're going to be able to find a pack
5:07
of post-it notes and you want to use
5:09
post-it notes make sure that you're
5:10
picking a color code where you can
5:12
readily get those colors so like a teal
5:15
character might not be
5:17
a great color to use whereas you can
5:19
definitely always find like purple or
5:21
green or yellow post-it notes same thing
5:24
of
5:24
when you're going to use pens again like
5:27
teal or rose gold you might not be able
5:29
to find pens readily available in those
5:32
color codes but if you use
5:34
just your basic type brush pens like
5:37
this or super tips or whatever you're
5:39
always going to be able to find things
5:40
like
5:42
red purple green blue i don't tend to
5:45
actually use yellow even though you can
5:46
find them in
5:48
these post-its pretty easily because i
5:50
find that you can't really read yellow
5:52
pen on a paper so if anything i'll use
5:55
orange sometimes and instead of yellow
5:58
but my four kind of go-to colors always
6:00
tend to be red green purple and blue
6:04
because those are easy to find in almost
6:06
every single pen set every single post
6:08
it's set page flags like this you can
6:10
always find those colors that are
6:12
usually easy to find so here's what i
6:15
bought to get started okay so main tools
Tools
6:17
of the trade
6:19
index cards i always need these
6:22
at target they have these unrolled index
6:24
cards for 50 cents 49 cents so i grabbed
6:27
a couple of them and then i also did get
6:29
this larger set of ruled index cards
6:32
these were like 89 cents i'm not sure i
6:35
kind of have some ideas of how i might
6:36
use them but i might not even use these
6:38
for the story but we'll see i do have
6:40
index cards but a lot of these are
6:42
already written on and i'm kind of
6:43
starting fresh and this is something
6:46
that i find when i'm getting back into a
6:47
story if i have old notes sometimes it
6:50
helps me more to rewrite my notes than
6:53
it does to work off my old notes i still
6:55
will use these as reference but i do
6:58
like to kind of re-immerse myself i am a
7:00
very immersive writer once i get into
7:03
the story world i like to just marinate
7:05
in it and live in it and stay in it as
7:07
deeply as i can
7:09
and when i've been disconnected from my
7:11
notes for
7:12
a few months i find it just so much more
7:15
helpful to recreate my notes and start
7:17
over so that is why i bought new index
7:20
cards just as a tip i do love to hole
7:23
punch the index cards on the edge and
7:25
use these little book binding rings that
7:27
you can find pretty much everywhere like
7:30
target office depot staples amazon and i
7:34
get the one inch ones and then you can
7:36
just make a little ring of your note
7:38
cards if you want but you can also just
7:39
throw a rubber band around them and
7:41
that's fine too this way they just don't
7:43
get out of order especially if they've
7:45
been sitting for a month i also grabbed
7:47
a new set of post-it notes and this is
7:48
what i was talking about earlier is
7:51
this is a pretty common
7:53
color combination for post-it to have
7:56
these four or five colors sometimes you
7:59
can't always find the red but i did
8:00
actually happen to find the red and i'm
8:03
almost out of some of my other ones so i
8:05
had to get a new set of them and just
8:07
one pad should be enough for me right
8:09
now i also grabbed these page markers
8:12
which i'm going to use on my index cards
8:14
the only thing that's sad and
8:16
disappointing here i mean it's really
8:17
just a small issue is that they never
8:19
have these in the red color they have
8:22
pink they have orange but they i've
8:23
never ever seen these page flags in red
8:26
now you could take a pad like this and
8:29
you could cut it down if you wanted to
8:32
but i probably will just substitute in
8:34
another color like i'll just use the
8:36
orange instead of the red and it'll be
8:38
fine so that is all that i actually
8:40
purchased at target there are so many
8:42
cute pin sets and everything else but i
8:44
have plenty of pens so i just kind of
8:46
got my pins together so let me show you
8:48
kind of what i love to use
8:50
these are called the zig clean color dot
8:54
markers i will link these down below you
8:56
can get them at places like jetpens or
8:58
at amazon but what i love about these
9:00
and you've probably seen people using
9:02
them before is they have just this i
9:04
don't know if i can get a better look of
9:06
it but they have just this little edge
9:08
here that is a little dot and so when
9:11
you want to make a color code
9:14
list you can just make a little dot
9:17
just super super simple like that and
9:20
these come in basically all of your just
9:23
basic colors so it's easy to grab these
9:26
in
9:27
those same four colors of my color code
9:30
here so you can see they have them in
9:31
the four colors that i use for my main
9:33
color code so then if i'm using just
9:36
plain white index cards i can when i'm
9:39
ready to start like a chapter for harper
9:42
or who is purple i can just take this
9:44
little dot marker put a purple dot on
9:46
the edge and then write her notes here
9:48
in a purple pen i particularly like to
9:51
use these pilot g2 pens or i also if i
9:54
feel like using a
9:56
felt tip pen i'll use these emmett ones
9:58
or
9:59
you can just use literally anything you
10:01
want i also
10:03
have this multi-color or multi-pin
10:06
this is something that i got at jetpens
10:09
and i like using this and i have it
10:11
already
10:12
loaded up with
10:14
the four colors that i use most in my
10:16
color code so that if i'm on the go and
10:18
i only want to take one pen and my note
10:20
cards then i just have all the different
10:22
colors of ink that i use and this is
10:24
just another part of that tip of like
10:26
when you use four basic colors like
10:29
purple red green blue
10:31
they're easy to find for any kind of pen
10:33
set so i highly recommend choosing those
10:36
kind of basic colors but i can just put
10:39
a dot on here
10:40
use my colored pen
10:42
write harper's notes on here and it's
10:45
always going to have that particular
10:46
kind of color code to it and i love
10:49
being able to use that another tool that
10:51
i will often use is washi tape and i
10:54
like to use in particular skinny
10:57
colorful washi tape this is a cool set
11:00
from mt that i got at jetpens i'll link
11:03
it down below
11:04
the red is kind of a more burgundy color
11:07
but it does have the blue it has the
11:09
green the purple in this set and i just
11:12
like using this and what i tend to do
11:14
with the washi tape is i will sometimes
11:17
create little tabs here so that i can
11:19
easily go to this set of notes or
11:22
you know anything like that if i am
11:24
writing in a notebook i can just tab the
11:27
edges with the washi tape i also can use
11:30
the washi tape in my actual plotting
11:32
notes if i want to have an entire page
11:36
here in my notebook that is just about
11:38
harper i'll just put
11:40
a set like a strip of the purple washi
11:43
tape along the edge so that when i'm
11:44
going to look through the book i can see
11:46
which
11:47
pages are marked with harper's pov or
11:50
it's just at a glance i can see harper
11:52
is separated on this page from
11:55
leah's point of view or something like
11:57
that so i like to use the washi tape for
11:58
that
11:59
another thing that i will sometimes use
12:01
for marking the pages is just page flags
12:04
like this so i got these from amazon if
12:06
only this was a purple page flag it
12:08
would be like the perfect set for me
12:10
but it has yellow instead so when i need
12:12
purple i will use this post-it one over
12:15
here
12:16
and i do the same thing there that if
12:18
i'm really paying attention to
12:21
where my notes are for jackson's pov
12:23
i've got either this sticking out or a
12:25
piece of washi tape sticking out another
12:28
set of things that i will often use is
12:30
either brush pens like this or if you
12:32
really want inexpensive but tons of
12:34
colors to choose from crayola super tips
12:37
because these do have kind of a fat
12:39
thick edge to them and i will use it
12:41
very similar to this where i will make
12:44
headers or i'll just put similar to the
12:46
washi tape if i want to mark this entire
12:50
card as something for airden's point of
12:52
view i'll just take that red marker or a
12:54
brush pen something thicker than just
12:56
like a you know regular pen like this
12:59
something that has a more brush edge to
13:01
it that you can see how this has much
13:03
thicker edge to it
13:04
and i will mark the page with a big
13:08
swath of that color
13:10
it's just a way to train my eyes that
13:12
when i'm flipping through i can be like
13:14
oh there's an aired in page or there's
13:16
more of my jackson notes and i can keep
13:18
them together if you don't use colorful
13:19
notes and this doesn't turn you on and
13:21
get you excited it's not like my books
13:23
are better because i use this it's just
13:25
more fun for me and this is
13:27
the way that my brain works and i find
13:30
that the more of these types of tools
13:31
that i use the more excited i get for my
13:33
book which then gets me really excited
13:35
for what's coming next i will link these
13:38
down below as well because i tend to use
13:40
the crap out of these so this is an
13:42
entire set basically of little tiny
13:46
quarter inch round stickers now if you
13:49
have
13:50
these little dot markers you don't
13:53
necessarily need stickers too so this is
13:55
kind of a little bit redundant but i use
13:57
them in different places so
13:58
if i'm using
14:00
the dot markers on my index cards they
14:03
are thick enough that it's not going to
14:05
bleed through however when i'm using
14:08
this look charm notebook that has all my
14:10
story stuff in it
14:11
these dots get so wet that they will
14:14
actually bleed through to the other side
14:16
of the page so when i'm in this notebook
14:18
because the look term pages are pretty
14:20
thin i prefer to use these little dots
14:24
and this pack is not super expensive and
14:26
it comes with tons of colors but of
14:28
course because i've chosen colors in my
14:29
color code that are very common i've got
14:32
those four colors right there readily
14:34
available and it does have orange and
14:37
yellow and even has metallic colors as
14:39
well so i will link that for you down
14:41
below but i really like to use those in
14:43
notebooks where it might bleed through
14:46
to the other side okay so that is the
Go Back To Work
14:48
first step for me is getting myself back
14:50
into all the tools and all the fun
14:52
stationery that i like if you don't care
14:54
for stationery and you don't need all
14:56
these tools then you can just skip step
14:57
one but i just find whatever you can
15:00
figure out for yourself that gets you in
15:02
the right mindset and gets you excited
15:04
to work on your story again for some of
15:06
you it might be that you go and you
15:07
watch a movie that reminds you of why
15:09
you love that genre or maybe you read a
15:11
bunch of books that are in a similar
15:13
genre so you can get yourself back into
15:14
the mindset of what turned you on about
15:16
your story in the first place whatever
15:18
it is that first step should just be
15:20
something that gets you excited to start
15:23
working again and for me that's my
15:25
passion for stationery step two though
15:28
is to actually go back to the work so my
15:31
step two is always to head over to the
15:34
laptop or my ipad or whatever i want to
15:36
use at the time pull up the document
15:39
that i've already started because
15:40
remember we're coming back to a project
15:42
that we started before and i'm going to
15:44
read through
15:46
everything that i have so far this part
15:48
of the process is very similar to what i
15:50
do when i start editing a book after
15:51
it's finished as well so what i'm going
15:53
to do is i'm going to open up
15:56
these index cards and i'm going to make
15:59
an index card for every scene that is
16:01
already currently in the book so i'm
16:02
going to read through everything i'm not
16:04
going to edit it as i go but i might
16:06
start taking notes which is something i
16:08
can do since i'm writing in google docs
16:10
and i'm going to make a scene card for
16:11
every single scene that i've written and
16:13
just remind myself what's there because
16:15
inevitably there's going to be a few
16:17
scenes that i'm like man i forgot i
16:18
wrote that i didn't even know that was
16:20
in there and so that's part of the
16:22
rediscovering process of getting back
16:25
into the story so let's get started
Reading Notes
16:30
[Music]
16:44
so
16:46
[Music]
16:50
[Applause]
16:51
[Music]
17:46
okay after a little bit of time now i
17:49
have an entire stack
17:51
of note cards here that basically have
17:54
the name of the character what scene is
17:57
currently that's probably going to
17:58
change these are going to change order
18:00
but it feels so good to have read back
18:03
through everything that i have so i
18:05
thought it was about halfway through my
18:06
rough draft but i'm really more like a
18:08
third when i look at the storyline
18:10
there's a lot of stuff here that i'm not
18:12
really going to be able to use i think
18:13
which is disappointing but you have to
18:15
meet yourself where you are so i have a
18:17
stack of note cards that have those
18:19
point of view references on it what
18:22
scene like what order the scene is
18:24
currently and just the main idea of what
18:26
happens in the scene so what's the main
18:29
action harper's looking at this harper's
18:31
having a conversation here jackson is
18:33
heading toward this you know scenario
18:35
here's how he's feeling if there's any
18:38
type of note about what's going on with
18:39
the character arc internally i've made
18:41
that on here as well so once i'm through
18:44
with this stage of the process which is
18:46
kind of the number two stage of the
18:48
getting myself back into
18:50
this
18:51
here's what i'm gonna do is i'm going to
18:53
pull out my notebook
18:55
so
18:56
my plotting notebook can change you know
18:59
i've used many different versions of
19:00
plotting notebooks and of course there's
19:02
no hard and fast rule here that you have
19:04
to use a plotting notebook or anything
19:06
like that but i did set this up and i
19:08
want this to be a chronicle of me
19:10
writing the final book in my shadow
19:12
demon saga so what i'm going to do now
19:15
is i'm going to spend some solid time
19:18
probably 30 minutes to an hour
19:20
journaling my thoughts about what shape
19:24
the story is in right now and for me
19:25
this is the third phase of getting back
19:28
into a story i find that if i just try
19:30
to jump right in and start writing i
19:32
always end up going back and doing this
19:35
part of it anyway because i need to
19:37
reacquaint myself with what's happening
19:39
and i need to get my mind around it and
19:42
when i'm just trying to think through my
19:44
thoughts
19:45
it can feel like a big jumbled mess when
19:47
i actually sit down and write out my
19:50
thoughts i am able to get them more
19:52
better organized i also find it helpful
19:55
at this point of the process since i do
19:57
have a wonderful husband who kind of
19:58
works as a critique partner for me once
20:00
i've done the journaling i also
20:02
sometimes will spend some time talking
20:03
to him about so here's what's happening
20:05
in the story here's how i feel about it
20:07
but for me once i've got all the note
20:09
cards written down and i reminded myself
20:11
what's actually currently in the story
20:13
and what's going to be usable
20:15
some of it is better than i thought some
20:16
of it is much worse than i thought and
20:19
so i have my notes now an essential part
20:22
of the process is to think through
20:24
by writing
20:26
and journaling
20:27
what i feel about this where i feel like
20:30
i'm on the right track where i feel like
20:32
i've gone off the rails where i think
20:34
the story is going from here and just
20:35
kind of get that brain dump so step
20:38
number three journaling
20:42
[Music]
21:02
[Music]
Planning
21:09
so the next part of the process for me
21:12
is all about making a plan
21:14
once i have determined what's left in my
21:18
novel what i still need to do
21:20
really gotten myself immersed back in
21:22
the story and the characters i like to
21:24
write out my plan like when am i
21:26
restarting what are the tasks i need to
21:28
do what's my current word count and how
21:30
many words do i have left to write and
21:32
then what's an average number of sprints
21:34
that i anticipate i'm gonna need so if
21:37
you're not familiar a writing sprint is
21:39
about it can be any length of time but i
21:41
do about 20 to 25 minutes each time
21:43
where i focus and then another thing i
21:46
like to do is set up
21:48
basically trackers so this is another
21:50
part of the mental side of getting ready
21:54
for
21:55
creating and getting back into it i get
21:57
motivated by trackers and this
22:00
particular idea comes from sarah mclean
22:02
i will link to her instagram post around
22:04
nanowrimo where she talked about
22:06
basically creating these blocks for
22:08
every 100 words that she does so that
22:10
she can stay motivated throughout the
22:12
process of writing and i love that and
22:14
i've never tried it in just 100 word
22:16
blocks you can see here i also have a
22:19
sprint tracker set up where i will track
22:21
every 25 minute sprint and how many
22:24
words i write and since i know that i
22:26
have about 75 000 words to write i know
22:29
that on average i write 650 words per
22:32
sprint that's a really low estimate but
22:35
i guesstimate that it's going to take me
22:37
about 113 sprints to finish the first
22:40
draft of this novel which will get me
22:42
about 73 000 more words so i know that
22:45
by the time i get to this page in my
22:47
sprint tracker the book should be
22:49
finished so that kind of stuff really
22:52
starts to motivate me i also like to set
22:55
up these daily pages where i say what my
22:58
intentions are what scenes i'm going to
22:59
write for the day what my notes are for
23:01
the day and you can see here i was also
23:04
using
23:05
that sort of pixel tracker each day
23:08
so what i'm going to do now is i'm just
23:10
going to go ahead and set up the first
23:13
day so i've been recording this over
23:16
multiple days and i spent quite a bit of
23:18
time journaling quite a bit of time
23:20
really thinking about the story and the
23:21
characters and now i'm just gonna set up
23:24
the first day back of actually writing
23:27
because that is really the final step in
23:29
the process once i have gotten all my
23:32
tools together and kind of cleared my
23:34
to-do list gotten my mindset ready for
23:37
being back in the process of writing
23:40
then step two was going through and
23:42
actually
23:43
really diving into the rough draft as it
23:46
is because we're going back to a book
23:48
that we started previously
23:50
so to me it's all about getting myself
23:52
in the mindset and then
23:54
writing out those note cards and seeing
23:56
what i'm dealing with what's in the
23:58
story what's good what's bad what am i
24:01
throwing out what am i using making
24:04
those scene cards and then the third
24:06
step there was
24:08
journaling my thoughts now that i know
24:10
what i'm working with i journal all
24:12
about it write about what's happening
24:13
with the characters get myself back in
24:15
the mindset of the story number four
24:18
make that plan set up any trackers
24:20
anything that's gonna really motivate me
24:22
how long is it gonna take me to finish
24:24
setting those goals and those deadlines
24:26
for myself and then finally
24:29
step five is just getting back to the
24:32
process of writing and
24:34
once i'm at that point
24:36
hopefully i'm back in the story and i'm
24:38
ready to
24:39
see it to completion so that is
24:42
basically my process of how i get back
24:44
into the story let me know in the
24:46
comments what your process looks like if
24:49
there are any steps that you follow that
24:51
are a little different from this also
24:53
let me know if you would like to see and
24:55
expand it i know i talked a lot about
24:57
the stationary part of things but let me
25:00
know if you'd like to see an expanded
25:01
video on what the process of actually
25:04
going through the note cards and what
25:07
that looks like what types of things i'm
25:09
writing down how i'm re-plotting and
25:11
those sort of details i know this was a
25:14
very much of an overview so if you'd
25:16
like to see more details on how i
25:17
actually get back into the writing of
25:19
the story the plotting
25:21
and figure out what parts of that rough
25:23
draft i'm going to use and how i know
25:25
what to throw away please let me know in
25:27
the comments and if you are just getting
25:29
back to either your nanowrimo novel or
25:32
something that you've written in the
25:33
past i want you to know that everybody
25:36
goes through periods where we feel like
25:38
the writing isn't coming our writing
25:40
isn't good enough our ideas aren't good
25:42
enough but as long as you stick with it
25:44
i promise you your ideas are great they
25:47
are worthwhile and we definitely need
25:49
your stories in the world so don't give
25:51
up on them all right you guys i will see
25:53
you all in my next video which hopefully
25:55
will be taking place from my brand new
25:57
house i'll see you then
25:59
[Music]
26:27
you
