
thank you
0:27
yay we made it 30 days we survived it
0:31
now some of us are coming out the other
0:33
side with a brand new novel completed
0:36
ready to be edited some of us are coming
0:39
out the side with a big old mess that
0:41
has to be completely Rewritten or edited
0:44
or it's only half the novel completed
0:46
some of us are ending the month
0:49
realizing that our preptober dreams did
0:52
not become a reality and we didn't quite
0:55
get where we wanted to go but whichever
0:57
result that you have uh business mentor
1:01
of mine James wedmore he likes to say
1:04
that whenever you go for a goal in your
1:07
life you either get
1:09
the win the outcome you were hoping for
1:12
and Beyond or you get the lesson that
1:15
you needed and the key to success in
1:17
life is not always winning because if
1:20
you study the greats people have done
1:23
the best like most amazing inspirational
1:25
things in this world it's not the people
1:27
who won everything they ever tried it's
1:30
the people who failed more often or fell
1:33
short more often than they ever won
1:37
but the key to success is knowing how to
1:42
take those moments of perceived failure
1:45
where you don't really hit the goal you
1:47
didn't follow through the way you wanted
1:48
it didn't turn out the way you hoped or
1:50
expected if you can take those moments
1:53
and learn from it about what do you need
1:57
to give yourself right now is this a
1:59
time when you were expecting too much of
2:00
yourself is this a lesson in you need
2:03
more discipline is this a lesson in gosh
2:06
I'm really not writing the thing I most
2:07
want to be writing or I'm not doing the
2:09
thing I most want to be doing is this a
2:11
lesson in I refuse to sacrifice my
2:15
health anymore for pushing too hard to
2:17
write or to do daily videos or you know
2:19
anything like that there are lessons
2:22
inside every goal we go for and this is
2:24
one of the reasons that I love goal
2:26
setting so much and I love going after
2:28
your dreams because it's really not
2:30
about hitting it every time
2:33
and the truth is life would be really
2:35
boring if we had no flaws and we were
2:37
perfect and we hit every single goal and
2:39
it was super predictable and it was
2:41
super easy like the reason that life is
2:44
so interesting and fun and rewarding is
2:47
because you get up you fall you try
2:50
again you learn you grow you change you
2:54
have this great adventure as you become
2:56
the person that you were meant to be
2:58
goals would not be fun if you knew that
3:00
you were going to hit them 100 of the
3:02
time and never you know fall short part
3:04
of the fun is the journey the struggle
3:07
the trying hard the going for it with
3:10
all that you are and sometimes it's the
3:12
not getting there not getting there not
3:14
getting there and then one day when you
3:16
climb that mountain and you finally do
3:18
it then it feels so much better than it
3:21
would have if you just I'm so good at
3:23
this I wrote 150 000 words every single
3:26
time I tried Nano like if that's you yay
3:28
celebrate it but the struggles are what
3:32
make it fun and the struggle is what
3:34
makes it meaningful it's what gives it
3:36
purpose and so whether you wrote 50
3:39
words this month or 50 000 you are a
3:43
winner because you tried you showed up
3:45
and you learned something so I hope that
3:50
you can walk away from whatever result
3:51
you ended up with this November or
3:54
whatever goals you've been going for in
3:56
your life I hope you can walk away
3:58
looking for the lesson and feeling
4:01
grateful for what you learned what you
4:04
got out of this and being proud of
4:07
yourself no matter what that result was
4:11
I also before we go since this is the
4:14
last day of Vlogs wanted to just kind of
4:17
give you some tips and pointers on what
4:20
do you do when Nano is finished
4:22
uh and what am I going to be doing now
4:25
that Nano is finished so I think one of
4:28
the most important things you can do for
4:30
yourself after a long stretch of putting
4:34
extra effort into a certain goal whether
4:36
it's a project that you've been working
4:39
on a book that you've been working on
4:40
you know anything in your life that is a
4:44
project that you have to distinctly
4:46
carve out time and you're putting more
4:47
time than normal and it more focused
4:49
than normal into a goal it's natural
4:52
that you're going to need a little bit
4:54
of a break so my biggest tip to you and
4:56
this is what I am doing with myself as
4:58
well post Nano is to check in with
5:02
yourself like just kind of grab a cup of
5:05
coffee and have a coffee chat
5:07
conversation with yourself and say how
5:09
am I feeling what do I need right now
5:11
and set the novel and the work aside for
5:14
a little bit and say
5:16
how do I feel because I think that we so
5:19
often just go through the motions of
5:21
life and we don't stop to say hey how
5:24
are you doing Sarah how's it going uh
5:26
because for me I have not only been
5:28
doing Nano you guys know I also did 13
5:31
days of events and giveaways before this
5:34
so this is like 43 days of daily content
5:38
and I'm tired uh I'm actually doing
5:42
pretty well emotionally but I'm tired
5:45
and my family is tired of me carrying
5:48
around a camera every day and doing all
5:50
these things my house is a little bit of
5:52
a mess which tends to happen when I'm
5:54
focused on a goal and when I really
5:57
check in with my heart and my soul what
6:00
I really want to be doing my futuristic
6:02
strategic achiever self really wants to
6:06
be sitting down with my 2023 plan and
6:09
thinking about how do I want to show up
6:11
for myself and my community next year
6:13
and so I am
6:16
gonna listen to my body that says it
6:18
needs a little bit more rest I'm gonna
6:21
listen to my family that says they need
6:23
a little bit more Sarah time and I'm
6:26
going to listen to my heart and soul
6:28
that says play with those planners play
6:30
with that new iPad just soak in the joy
6:34
no matter what reward you gave yourself
6:36
this Nano and truthfully if you are
6:40
withholding a reward because you didn't
6:42
quite hit it I encourage you to set a
6:44
new goal for yourself for the new year
6:47
or something like that that you can say
6:48
okay I didn't hit 50k during Nano but if
6:52
I can hit 10K in December or if I can
6:54
hit 50K by the end of January then I can
6:57
get that iPad or then I can go out for
6:59
that coffee or whatever that reward was
7:02
or just set a new reward for yourself
7:04
and say I made it through I may not have
7:07
hit the goal I wanted but I made it
7:08
through and I'm proud of myself so I'm
7:10
gonna give myself a self-care day to go
7:12
out to the movie get my nails done go
7:15
get some coffee whatever it is that
7:17
makes you happy
7:18
but sometimes when we sacrificed a
7:21
little bit to push for that goal it can
7:24
be so helpful and
7:26
just healing to say I'm going to take a
7:31
day or a week or the rest of the month
7:33
to just rest and to sort of pamper
7:38
myself in terms of Joy so little things
7:42
like a bubble bath sitting outside
7:44
without my phone or a camera or anything
7:47
else and just talking to George for a
7:49
couple hours with the fire going having
7:51
an entire afternoon with the kids at the
7:54
zoo we've got some plans for December
7:56
and I'm so looking forward to it because
7:58
there were some things that I sacrificed
8:00
in November to be able to do Nano
8:02
Diaries there were things that I
8:04
sacrificed in order to get these words
8:06
in at night I didn't spend as much time
8:08
with my husband so now I'm gonna just
8:10
like live in this little bubble with
8:12
them and I'm so looking forward to it so
8:14
I hope that you are able to do the same
8:17
for yourself to listen to your body
8:19
listen to your mind take some time to
8:22
like process how you did this month and
8:24
what lesson it might want to leave with
8:26
you and then just enjoy the heck out of
8:29
life for a little bit and know that you
8:31
have done a good job so that's probably
8:34
my first tip is you know the self-care
8:37
stuff but when it comes to your novel
8:40
let me tell you what I'm gonna do first
8:42
so what I have on my hands is a just shy
8:46
of about 57 58 000 words of a book that
8:50
I believe is going to be at least 85 to
8:53
95 000 words so I have roughly let's say
8:57
30 plus thousand more to write and there
9:01
are words inside this novel that are
9:03
like brainstorming words or that aren't
9:06
really novel words they're just thought
9:08
words right so my first order of
9:10
business is to kind of this will be part
9:13
of my self-care too is to go through
9:15
what I have on this wall and to go
9:17
through every single scene of my current
9:21
Nano draft now if you are looking to
9:25
edit I have an entire video series here
9:28
on YouTube about how to edit your novel
9:30
and so I'm going to link all those
9:31
editing Style videos down below like
9:34
here's my process for when I start
9:35
editing because the main thing that I
9:38
love to do and this is what I like to do
9:39
after Nano too because I find that my
9:42
Nano words are not as like organized or
9:44
clean as my normal monthly words would
9:47
be so I like to go through every single
9:50
chapter or scene of the book that is
9:53
there now in the draft no matter how
9:55
messy it is and write just a little
9:57
snippet about what happens in that scene
9:59
so I'll just take a sheet of paper and
10:01
I'll say you know chapter one and I'll
10:03
say like Lorelei arrives at the
10:06
apartment and this is what happens and
10:09
then I'll leave myself a little note
10:10
about how I think that scene needs to
10:12
change or any little thought about if it
10:15
just needs total rewrites or if it's in
10:17
pretty good shape or if there's just
10:20
like a kernel of idea that I'm going to
10:21
keep and the rest is going to be
10:22
Rewritten so I'll read through it I'll
10:25
make a little note about that and and
10:27
then move on to the next chapter chapter
10:28
two this is what happens it's a total
10:31
mess chapter three was a brainstorming
10:32
chapter so that needs to be deleted and
10:35
I'll just go through and kind of take an
10:37
audit of what's there now and that helps
10:39
me to arrange my thoughts a little bit
10:42
and then what I can do is I can go to
10:44
the wall or I can go to my plotting
10:46
notebook and I can start to see what are
10:48
the holes that need to be filled in what
10:50
still needs to be written and then I can
10:52
create a plan from there and my plan
10:55
might look something like go back and
10:57
start cleaning things up or my plan
10:59
might Simply Be let's start where we are
11:02
now that I have a more organized idea of
11:04
what's happened and what I've written
11:06
and let's try to write those next 35 000
11:08
words and I won't really know what
11:10
direction I want to take it personally
11:12
until I have done that sort of inventory
11:15
or audit of what's there
11:17
it's also possible that you're on a roll
11:20
that you know exactly what's happening
11:22
next so you might not want to take that
11:23
time to sort of audit you might want to
11:25
just be like I'm going to power through
11:26
the rest of my note cards and I'm going
11:28
to get this novel finished or you might
11:31
have already finished your book and
11:32
you're ready to start edits in Earnest
11:34
and you might want to set it aside for a
11:36
couple weeks enjoy the holidays and then
11:38
come back to it but really and truly
11:40
it's whatever you feel like you want to
11:42
do
11:43
the one thing that I want to discourage
11:46
you from doing
11:48
and this is what a lot of people do Post
11:50
Nano is feeling so burned out on the
11:53
work that you did and the story that you
11:55
wrote that you just never go back to
11:58
finish this story
12:00
you spent the last 30 days or
12:03
potentially more working on this idea
12:06
and you know okay maybe it's possible
12:09
that it was so terrible and it turned
12:11
out so awful that you just don't even
12:13
have an interest in finishing it but you
12:15
learned so much about what not to do
12:17
that you're excited to work on something
12:18
new go for it however there are also
12:22
going to be some of you and I know this
12:23
from experience and I know this from
12:25
talking to a lot of authors who are
12:27
going to just walk away feeling so
12:29
burned out and defeated or just so tired
12:33
of it for a little while that you just
12:35
go on to the next shiny idea and this
12:38
one gathers cobwebs in the corner and
12:41
then the next time a nano comes around
12:43
you write a new shiny idea and then
12:44
another shiny idea and you never
12:46
actually finish a novel so I encourage
12:49
you to take this moment whether it's
12:52
just one day or whether it's the month
12:54
of December
12:55
and really think about
12:57
who do you want to be as a writer in the
12:59
world what is it you want to accomplish
13:01
and what are the next steps that you can
13:03
do with this novel or with any other
13:05
ideas or past novels that still have
13:07
cobwebs on them what are you going to do
13:09
with those to get them finished and to
13:11
start your publishing career and to
13:13
start making your dreams come true
13:14
because publishing and putting yourself
13:17
out there is a very different thing than
13:19
sitting down to write during Nano but if
13:21
this is what you want then I encourage
13:24
you to stick it stick with it through
13:26
the fear and finish that book so I'll
13:29
have some videos down below I know you
13:31
guys are going to miss me right
13:33
I'll have some videos down below that
13:35
you can explore that's from some of my
13:37
older content if you are looking to
13:38
start edits and that's basically my
13:42
biggest tips is don't abandon your novel
13:44
make a plan make a organ you know
13:47
organize the chaos and keep going and
13:51
then take care of yourself take a break
13:53
take stock of what the lesson is that's
13:55
learned and keep moving forward I hope
13:58
that you have enjoyed hanging out with
14:00
me over the last 30 days thank you to
14:03
the thousands of you that have been
14:04
following every single day when I was a
14:07
little girl I used to dream and imagine
14:08
that I had my own little TV show I would
14:10
look in the mirror and I would have a
14:12
little microphone and I had this
14:14
realization you know doing these Vlogs
14:16
and seeing the numbers of people that
14:18
are following daily and thinking I kind
14:20
of do have my own TV show so thank you
14:22
for making that dream come true I know
14:25
that I show up messy and I show up
14:28
imperfect and I know that you know I'm
14:32
not perfect in any way I know that I
14:34
don't always have it together but that's
14:36
part of my
14:38
purpose in life I think is to share the
14:41
messy parts and to show you that you can
14:44
mess up you can fall short you can
14:48
completely fall flat on your face one
14:50
year and then you can choose to pick
14:52
yourself up and Triumph over those
14:55
struggles over that story you can find
14:57
your joy again you can be massively
15:00
successful and joyful even if you've had
15:03
bad past experiences even if you failed
15:06
in the past even if you couldn't make it
15:09
this time your future success is there
15:13
waiting for you and it may be messy it
15:16
may be imperfect but it's your life and
15:19
it's your journey and I just want you to
15:21
know that you're not alone so I share my
15:24
mess so that you can know that you're
15:26
okay to have messes and Trauma and days
15:29
that are hard and stress in your life
15:31
too so I hope that has been a comfort to
15:33
some of you I am forever grateful I
15:36
never even a day take make it for
15:38
granted that I have this amazing
15:40
community so thank you for being a part
15:41

15:44

you guys I did it I have the iPad I
9:49
cannot believe it I was so scared I was
9:52
not gonna make it there when I was so
9:54
far behind early on but that
9:57
heartbreakings Riding community all of
9:59
the people that are running Sprints that
10:00
I was able to jump in on or our whole
10:02
Community was able to jump in on really
10:04
saved me writing at night really helped
10:08
me a lot too it's not something I want
10:10
to always do but now that I've got some
10:12
positive momentum I'm planning to ride
10:14
that all the way home I did take a
10:17
little bit of time to set up the
10:20
stickers the way that I want them to
10:21
I've got this cool new peachful High
10:23
demons one that's kind of like the high
10:26
school that is in my Shadow Demon Saga
10:28
and some of my favorite like games and
10:32
Anime and stuff like that and what I'm
10:34
gonna do is I'm spending a self-care day
10:36
on day 30. so I'm going to set up my
10:41
iPad I'm gonna binge watch some stuff
10:44
I'm gonna go get a Starbucks and it's
10:45
going to be awesome but I finally got to
10:47
open this up and thank you so much for
10:49
celebrating with me let me know in the
10:51
comments if you did Nano what you have
10:54
rewarded yourself with because it
10:56
doesn't have to be something fancy like
10:57
an iPad it could just be a simple like
11:01
binge day uh trip out to get your nails
11:04
done an extra Starbucks it could be some
11:06
special like weekend away with your
11:08
loved one it could be just time to sit
11:10
and do nothing but read for an entire
11:12
weekend or to binge watch your favorite
11:14
show or to finally Play that video game
11:16
you've been looking forward to but it's
11:18
good mentally after you've been working
11:22
for a deadline whether you technically
11:23
hit the 50k or not to reward yourself
11:25
for doing your best and for trying and
11:28
for getting words on the page so even if
11:30
you didn't hit as many words as you
11:32
planned originally go reward yourself
11:34
now for a successful month so one final
11:38
vlog tomorrow to wrap it all up and this
11:43
will be the end of the Nano Diaries
11:44

11:46
part of this and I will see you tomorrow

[Music]
0:16
[Music]
0:32
today's the day you guys I'm gonna win
0:35
Nano today I can feel it I need about 33
0:39
50 words so it needs to be a really big
0:41
writing day for me but I'm feeling
0:43
excited I feel good I've got my iPad
0:46
literally sitting right here staring at
0:48
me
0:49
today's the day so I have a tower the
0:52
iPad is hiding inside here I have not
0:54
opened it I have some accessories to go
0:58
with it I'm excited
1:01
um I have I'm getting close to 150
1:03
members in hb90 and we haven't even been
1:06
open 24 hours so I'm feeling like
1:09
extremely humbled and blessed and
1:11
excited for everything that's to come
1:13
I'm gonna move this 50k down today we're
1:17
doing it so Evie and I have our matching
1:20
shirts on today yeah so we got these
1:24
from an online clothing store and I've
1:27
always like my whole life dreamed of
1:28
having mommy and me outfits and so we're
1:32
doing it today it's a day of excitement
1:35
and joy and I cannot wait now this will
1:38
not be the end of my novel because it is
1:41
going to be probably 85 to 90 000 words
1:44
but I have made significant progress and
1:48
this is the most I have have written in
1:50
probably a year and a half and I am so
1:53
grateful that I just feel like so joyful
1:57
I it's just like overflowing so it's
2:00
exciting and I'm gonna take that
2:03
excitement and carry it to the finish
2:05
line
2:07
you want to say hi to the video
2:10
you look so cute in your new shirt so I
2:13
was thinking about what I wanted to do
2:14
in terms of do I want to go ahead and
2:16
grab my Starbucks first or do I want to
2:20
go ahead and write first and George ever
2:23
the wise husband suggested maybe I go
2:26
out to a coffee shop this morning and
2:28
right now normally I have a meeting with
2:29
Renee but we met on Sunday to launch the
2:31
course so I'm going to be writing today
2:33
during that time and so I think I'm
2:36
gonna go right at the local coffee shop
2:39
for a couple hours pick up lunch for the
2:41
family return my
2:43
um so my things that need to be returned
2:44
and then I will come back and finish up
2:46
this afternoon so I'm gonna make the bed
2:49
real quick and then I'm gonna get on the
2:51
road
2:53
[Music]
3:24
foreign
3:40
[Music]
3:46
so I got to write for an hour
3:49
1174 words not quite halfway to what I
3:52
need today but it's a start I'm gonna go
3:55
pick up lunch do some errands and then
3:57
I'll be writing again this afternoon
4:00
foreign
4:12
hey guys it's almost dinner time here it
4:15
is a little after five o'clock I had my
4:18
accelerate meeting I was attempting to
4:22
start work on putting my planner
4:23
together for December and I spent some
4:26
time with the kids and finished my video
4:28
and put my Vlog up on YouTube for
4:30
yesterday
4:32
but I have not had any more time to ride
4:35
so I'm hoping again it'll be kind of a
4:38
night owl writing session but I don't
4:40
know that I can get 2 000 words in
4:43
tonight after the day so we'll see uh I
4:48
thought I would get another writing
4:49
session in this afternoon but it just
4:51
did not happen so we'll see if I can
4:55
pull it out or if I'm gonna be a little
4:56
bit too tired to do it this evening so
5:00
got dark
5:02
once that sun goes down this whole house
5:04
starts to get dark but
5:06
we're gonna eat some tasty dinner
5:08
probably watch more Great British baking
5:10
show maybe go outside and do a fire
5:12
tonight which would be fun and it's not
5:15
too cold tonight and then we'll see
5:17
where we end up with the writing worst
5:20
case scenario I don't write any more
5:22
tonight and I get those last 2 000 or so
5:25
words tomorrow but it's happening it's
5:28
like today is the 28th
5:30
so I have two days left to write 2200 or
5:34
so words so I'm feeling confident but a
5:37
little bit defeated that it might not
5:38
happen today but we're gonna still try
5:41
for it if I end up with uh just a
5:44
powerful surge of energy later this
5:46
evening and I can write those 2000 words
5:48
I'm going to try for it
5:50
um but I'm gonna also give myself a
5:52
little Grace if it doesn't happen
5:54
tonight it's been a good day there's a
5:56
lot of just joyful happy things going on
5:59
and honestly when I think back to how
6:02
stressed and sad and
6:06
I can't even find the best words to
6:09
express it
6:10
um scared I was this time last year
6:14
it feels really good to be standing here
6:16
now
6:18
I may be busy but I'm joyful and I'm
6:21
living the life that I have always
6:23
wanted to live and I am not perfect I am
6:27
flawed and it can be a very vulnerable
6:29
thing to share those flaws because
6:31
sometimes when you share the flaws
6:34
people want to come back at you with all
6:36
the ways you need to fix your life and
6:38
so I I know those those comments are
6:41
coming coming through but the vast
6:43
majority of the comments and emails and
6:45
messages I've been getting have been so
6:47
overwhelmingly kind and beautiful and I
6:51
cannot even express to you how much your
6:53
love and support on this channel has
6:55
been for me over the last year of my
6:57
life and really over the last four plus
7:00
years of my life this YouTube community
7:02
and all of you are some of the greatest
7:04
blessings of my whole life and I hope
7:08
you know that I hope you know how loved
7:10
you are and how appreciated you are
7:11
because it means a lot every word of
7:13
encouragement every cheerleading moment
7:15
every it's okay
7:18
you're doing great has meant so much to
7:20
me and I hope these videos have meant
7:22
something to you along the way as well
7:24
so did it mean to get emotional there
7:26
but it just came pouring out because I
7:29
have this five-year journal and I can
7:30
see every night when I go to write in it
7:32
what I was going through last year and
7:34
the year before and this time last year
7:36
was some of the hardest times of you
7:40
know the last 10 years and I am so glad
7:43
to be through it if I could just go back
7:45
in time and hug that version of Sarah
7:47
who was struggling to put on a brave
7:49
face for YouTube but while I was
7:51
privately going through hell I would hug
7:53
her and say it's gonna be okay and your
7:56
community stands behind you and it just
7:58
I can't fully Express how much it means
8:00
to me and has meant to me this whole
8:02
year so I love y'all I love you I love
8:05
you and you know life is truly good and
8:09
if you're going through a hard time
8:11
know that there is a future version of
8:13
yourself right now
8:15
thinking back on you and saying I wish I
8:17
could just give them a hug and let them
8:20
know that it's going to be okay because
8:22
we go through seasons of life we go
8:24
through busy Seasons we go through
8:26
difficult traumatic Seasons but we also
8:29
have our joyful grateful seasons and I'm
8:32
in one of them
8:34
I'm in one of them right now just
8:36
overwhelming gratitude and joy and it
8:40
means a lot to me and I cannot believe
8:41
that after all the struggle I have
8:43
almost 50 000 plus words into this book
8:47
it just means a lot so
8:49
no tears before dinner
8:52
all right let's eat and I will see you
8:54
guys for one more writing session
8:55
tonight and we'll see if we can bring
8:57
that win home we'll see if we can make
8:59
it
9:01
[Music]
9:24
[Music]
9:29
thank you
9:31
yay so one of my Black Friday purchases
9:34
just arrived this is called the Skylight
9:38
calendar and this will be my solution to
9:42
not using a paper planner for our family
9:45
meal plan and so that everybody can see
9:48
like when does Andrew need his lunch and
9:50
when does he have a test and when do we
9:52
have you know what are we having for
9:53
dinner what are our rituals what's on
9:55
Sarah's business calendar and then you
9:57
can also do chores on here and other
10:00
things like that we obviously just set
10:01
it up but I'm pretty excited to try this
10:05
out and it will live here next to our
10:06
little Google home and this will be
10:09
hopefully a new digital solution for our
10:13
family
10:14
and the kids are occupied upstairs for a
10:16
little bit it's about 7 30. I need to
10:19
start Evie's bath but I'm actually going
10:20
to try to just get a 10 minute Sprint in
10:22
just 10 minutes let's see if we can do a
10:25
little bit of damage here
10:26
[Music]
10:37
okay so I went 15 minutes and I'm at 48
10:42
596 so that means I am only like 1400
10:46
Awards away from finishing this up 1400
10:51
words I can do that tonight I know I can
10:53
do it this is happening this is really
10:55
happening I gotta go get Evie in the
10:57
bath and then I will be back to claim
10:59
that 50K
11:04
foreign
11:07
[Music]
11:24
with my hair but I am at 49
11:30
118 words so
11:33
could be the last Sprint right here ah
11:35
I'm so excited
11:37
foreign
11:44
[Music]
11:52
okay guys 49 750 words Jen who I'm
11:58
sprinting with and I'm also sprinting
11:59
with Lisa I'm with Jen on zoom and Lisa
12:02
on uh YouTube 250 words left exactly so
12:07
here we go
12:09
this is happening
12:11
9 43 p.m on the 28th let's do this
12:16
[Music]
12:31
[Music]
12:34
[Applause]
12:44
foreign
12:49
fifty six
12:51
I did it oh my gosh Lisa just put some
12:55
confetti on the screen
12:58
yay oh my gosh I cannot I cannot believe
13:02
that I did it oh she just put bats on
13:04
the screen too and a ghost
13:07
yay oh my gosh after such a unbelievably
13:12
tough year and honestly not writing at
13:17
this level for a year and a half of my
13:19
life
13:20
I was so scared that I no longer knew
13:23
how to do this or that I had forgotten
13:25
or that I was never going to be good at
13:27
it again and just to
13:30
to be sitting here 50 000 words in plus
13:33
the seven that I wrote before Nano
13:36
it feels really good I'm super emotional
13:39
it's just like oh my God I can't believe
13:43
and you know no matter how many times I
13:45
have finished books before
13:48
it feels good to be sitting in this
13:51
moment so thank you all for cheering me
13:53
on I can't believe it I'm gonna go put
13:55
it in the Nano site okay I still haven't
13:57
put it in the Nano site because I was on
14:00
Zoom with my friend Jen and I was on
14:03
um like all the chat with Lisa and
14:06
everybody was blowing up and then my
14:08
Facebook Messenger was blowing up so it
14:10
feels good to have this community behind
14:12
me to be getting these words and it has
14:15
been a year and a half of what feels
14:17
like a drought and I was so scared I
14:19
wasn't going to be able to like find my
14:21
inspiration again so this I cannot even
14:23
express I know I'm just gonna go in the
14:26
bathroom and just cry like a little baby
14:28
because this just means so much to me I
14:31
cannot even express to you so let's
14:32
let's really go put this in on the site
14:34
at Nano
14:36
okay 50
14:39
oh five six
14:47
okay so I think because I messed up the
14:50
other night and put in too many words
14:52
that it's not gonna give me the confetti
14:54
which is too bad because
14:58
um Lisa did it for me but it didn't give
15:00
it to me on the site but when you win
15:02
you get this um congratulations winner
15:05
but usually the site Rains Down confetti
15:08
and it says winner or whatever but there
15:09
are some winner goodies here like a
15:12
little certificate you can print out
15:14
um some swag stuff you can buy some
15:16
winter Flair that you can put on your
15:18
Instagram and other social media and
15:20
stuff and then I think there's also
15:22
going to be some discounts and stuff but
15:24
that's so funny that I don't get the
15:26
confetti because I got it too early when
15:28
I accidentally put it
15:30
that I wrote a 40
15:32
000 word Sprint so that's okay oh my
15:35
gosh I'm so excited and not just that I
15:38
wrote the 50 000 words this month which
15:40
feels really good I mean I have won
15:42
Nanos before and I have probably had
15:44
just as many Nanos that I didn't win but
15:48
it still is a win regardless of whether
15:51
you hit 50k or not and I know sometimes
15:53
it doesn't feel like that but there's
15:55
also value in setting a goal for
15:57
yourself and achieving it because it
15:58
really builds that positive momentum so
16:00
whether your goal was actually 50k or it
16:02
was like 20K I hope that you take the
16:05
time to celebrate yourself for every win
16:08
because truly every word especially when
16:11
you're struggling or you've had a tough
16:12
year every word is a win every time you
16:15
sit down at the keyboard to make a
16:17
commitment that you're gonna sit down
16:19
and write that you're going to work on
16:20
your story that you're going to do the
16:21
brave thing of putting your words onto
16:24
paper and your ideas onto paper and
16:27
knowing that someday someone's gonna
16:29
read them like it's not an easy thing to
16:32
Bear your soul in that way to be
16:34
vulnerable in that way to test the
16:37
limits of your own imagination and your
16:39
own creativity in that way and so I hope
16:42
that you understand
16:44
how valuable you are and how Brave and
16:47
courageous you are for even making the
16:49
attempt
16:51
but it it means something it's like it
16:54
there's not winners and losers but
16:56
setting a goal for yourself and going
16:58
after it means something and this really
17:02
means something big to me and I feel
17:04
like I'm gonna cry again
17:06
it really means something to me because
17:08
like I said this time last year I was
17:11
struggling
17:12
more than I had probably in a decade and
17:16
to be able to come through it and have
17:18
this community behind me all of you who
17:21
have been following this journey it
17:23
means so much more than I can express
17:25
and regardless of what outside people
17:30
think just to sit in this room and write
17:33
these words and have it come together
17:35
like right at the 50k I had this big aha
17:38
moment in the story where these moments
17:40
connected in the I've been writing out
17:42
of order and these moments came together
17:44
and I was like oh that's gonna be how
17:46
this connects to this other thing and I
17:47
can weave that in and I was thinking
17:49
this is so much fun
17:51
and then I looked up and it was 50k and
17:54
if you can do this thing and also be
17:57
having fun with it that's like that's
18:01
the win right there not the 50 000 not
18:04
the Nano not how fast you did it but
18:07
just that you're having fun following
18:08
your dreams like what could be better
18:10
than that
18:13
it feels good it really feels good so
18:16
thank you for being on this journey with
18:17
me I am actually not gonna open my iPad
18:21
right now I'm gonna wait and that will
18:23
be my day 29 Vlog so that I have some
18:26
post Nano content I'm gonna do some post
18:28
Nano self-care as well and this book is
18:32
not over 50
18:34
000 words does not a novel make every
18:36
single time
18:37
my very first novel beautiful demons is
18:40
less than 50 000 words it's about 47 000
18:43
words but most of my novels are closer
18:45
to the 90 to 100
18:47
000 word Mark and this one is going to
18:49
be no exception I think it will be at
18:51
least 85 to 90k so I still have 30s 33
18:55
35 potentially thousand at least more
18:58
words to go so I will still be writing
19:01
some tomorrow
19:02
um but maybe I'll be writing on my new
19:04
iPad so we'll look forward that to that
19:06
tomorrow fresh writing on my brand new
19:08
iPad and we'll unbox it and put in all
19:11
the accessories and everything
19:13
um I don't know if I'm gonna be able to
19:14
sleep tonight and now I'm wishing I had
19:16
saved that wine for today instead of
19:18
drinking it yesterday but I have my
19:20
water so I will cheers
19:22
um to all of you congratulations to
19:25

19:27

hello my friends
0:02
are we allowed to have a PJ party here
0:05
on day 27 because this is about all I'm
0:08
capable of today
0:12
[Music]
0:19
[Music]
0:34
so I am sitting here it's 9 45 and I
0:38
have a glass of wine for myself to kind
0:41
of celebrate a successful day and I'm
0:44
tired I've got the glasses on I've got
0:47
the PJs on I've got Lisa and her Sprints
0:50
for the heartbreathing's writing
0:51
community on my screen and I'm finally
0:53
sitting down to write it has been
0:56
another busy day but you guys saw the
0:59
day the way it was yesterday so today I
1:01
had a lot to do not as much to do but I
1:04
ended up taking a lot more breaks today
1:06
than I did yesterday and it was much
1:09
needed so I didn't finish everything on
1:10
my list today and that is okay tomorrow
1:13
I cannot believe it's already like back
1:16
to school for Andrew so we have to get
1:19
back in a routine up the same time you
1:22
know getting him to school and
1:23
everything I feel like I'm not ready for
1:25
that but ready or not he's going to
1:28
school
1:29
um I launched hb90 course today thank
1:32
you to everybody who has signed up up
1:34
because we have had almost 100 people
1:36
I'm four people away from a hundred
1:39
signups on day one which just blows my
1:41
mind and I'm so excited to serve this
1:44
community I feel very humbled because I
1:48
just never dreamed that this course
1:50
would be able to help so many people so
1:52
it feels really good so I've got myself
1:53
a glass this is actually like rose
1:56
bubbly and I had this on Thanksgiving
2:00
and I was able to put a little cap in it
2:02
and it still is bubbly even several days
2:04
later which makes me happy
2:06
um the only thing
2:08
actually I got a lot of my list done
2:10
today but I did not work on the q1
2:12
planner but I did just finish the 2023
2:15
goals planner the first round of that
2:17
planner so that will definitely be
2:18
coming out in just a couple days on Etsy
2:21
so we're moving forward but
2:24
wouldn't you know it that as soon as we
2:26
got home from dinner
2:29
the door alarm sounded
2:31
um it tells us when someone is like
2:33
moving around out front
2:35
and it was the Amazon delivery guy and
2:38
he just delivered my iPad and all my
2:42
accessories they were not supposed to be
2:44
here till Tuesday or Wednesday but
2:46
they're here early and George was like
2:49
don't you open it don't you do it and I
2:51
did not do it I opened the box like the
2:54
the iPad box came in and made sure that
2:57
everything looked like it was fine and
2:59
put it away and just really wanted to
3:03
open it I want it to be mine I'm ready
3:05
for it to be mine I'm 5 000 words away
3:07
for it to be mine and I'm so ready for
3:10
this and I bought some cute accessories
3:13
actually I don't think the keyboard is
3:14
here yet but I bought some like a new
3:16
cover because this is a different size I
3:18
previously well I currently have the 11
3:20
inch iPad Pro but I went for the 12.9
3:24
inch iPad Pro because I'm going to be
3:26
doing more digital planning and
3:28
multitasking on my iPad in 2023 I also
3:32
took a little bit of time to start
3:34
setting up my December planner I didn't
3:37
get it all done but I printed out my
3:39
December pages and I have decided to use
3:41
the pretty red patent leather Webster's
3:43
pages and I think the red will just be
3:45
perfect for the season
3:47
but I need to get some work done on this
3:51
5 000 words there's no way I'm gonna hit
3:53
it tonight which will make me sad all
3:55
day tomorrow but
3:57
which will actually inspire me to write
3:59
extra tomorrow because maybe if I can
4:01
get a couple thousand words today
4:04
I can hit my 50k tomorrow so
4:07
I'm ready to go there's still 20 minutes
4:09
on the clock with Lisa's Sprints so
4:11
let's see how far I can get before I
4:13
need to get to bed
4:15
[Music]
4:39
[Music]
4:45
foreign
4:45
[Music]
4:52
[Music]
5:03
okay two sprints I got about 500
5:06
something words let's see what Nano says
5:09
I got 530 words the first Sprint and
5:12
1043 words the second Sprint Lisa is
5:15
doing one more Sprint but is 10 41 and
5:19
after consuming a bit of this wine I
5:22
cannot hang I have lost my ability to
5:24
hang so I am going to do my tarot card
5:28
reading and I'm going to go to sleep
5:30
ever I did start my day feeling like I
5:33
was gonna Vlog through the morning the
5:35
meeting with Renee setting up the course
5:37
setting up my planner so I'm gonna pop
5:39
in some of that Vlog footage here
5:42
so that you can see that I did have
5:44
better intentions for vlogging more
5:46
today that just didn't make it so let's
5:48
go through that footage real quick hey
5:50
good morning it's launch day for hb90 so
5:54
I'm about to meet with Renee and we're
5:56
gonna open up the course
5:58
oh my gosh what a morning oh I just
6:03
it always feels so satisfying to open up
6:05
the doors to the course and see that
6:07
people are still interested we have
6:08
about 50 people already signed up for HB
6:11
90 so if you want to come join us we are
6:12
open until December 11th and this will
6:14
of course be the final round of 2022 as
6:18
we look into 2023 part of my to-do list
6:22
for today Sunday is obviously launch the
6:25
course I'm working on the planners but I
6:27
also need to print out my December pages
6:29
and I've been thinking about trying
6:31
something a little bit different
6:33
uh as many of you know if you've been
6:36
following for a while
6:37
I have the HP 90 planner that I designed
6:41
and it has kind of a different layout
6:44
than what you see in most planners so
6:46
you have a task page where you can say
6:48
according to goal here's the tasks I'm
6:49
doing for the week then it has task
6:51
blocks like a Time tracking page and
6:54
then you have a two page spread to kind
6:56
of plan out when you're going to do
6:58
things so you've got the list of things
7:00
to do and then you have the scheduling
7:03
of what you're going to do and then
7:05
there's a daily page and I used to be
7:08
totally religious about filling out the
7:10
daily page
7:12
as I get busier you'll start to see here
7:16
I haven't been using it every day
7:20
and
7:21
so then I find that it's not as useful
7:25
for me to have just two pages out of the
7:28
seven days that are being used or one
7:30
page out of the seven days like I don't
7:32
think I used any daily Pages this
7:34
particular week
7:35
so I'm thinking about switching things
7:38
up for 2023 even though it kind of makes
7:40
me sad because I love my daily page but
7:43
you know we evolve and we change and so
7:46
I'm going to try something different for
7:47
December so I what I like to do when I'm
7:50
doing my A5 pages is I will actually
7:52
take my HP premium like 32 pound paper I
7:57
will link this down below because it's
7:58
actually on sale on Amazon this is
8:00
really thick paper it was so funny
8:02
because I went to go get my driver's
8:03
license here in Texas and the lady kept
8:07
like trying to separate the page and I
8:09
was like it's just one page and she like
8:11
licked her finger and was trying to
8:12
separate it and I was like excuse me
8:13
ma'am it's just one page it's just
8:15
really thick and then George said when
8:18
he went to take his forms in they did
8:20
the same thing so it was just kind of
8:21
funny because it's really thick but um
8:24
anyway just to be warned it also though
8:27
doesn't ghost at all and it's just
8:30
lovely paper I love it but I like to go
8:32
ahead and cut the paper down to A5 size
8:34
then I can put it in into my printer and
8:37
I set the page size to A5 and I print
8:40
all of the even pages and then I turn
8:42
them over and print all the odd pages
8:44
and that way I have a perfect planner
8:46
but it does take a little bit more work
8:48
to print your own and kind of figure out
8:49
how to do it but sorry the kids are kind
8:52
of playing around over there but it's
8:54
time to do my December pages and I think
8:55
instead of printing out the daily Pages
8:58
I'm going to try the weekly spread
9:01
which has all of the same like weekly
9:04
Pages which I do use but then instead of
9:07
the daily Pages it has a blank page here
9:10
and then the weekly review over here and
9:13
then it just goes to the next week and
9:15
instead of doing daily pages in my
9:17
planner I'm going to try doing daily
9:19
pages in notion instead
9:22
so we'll see how it goes I might end up
9:25
reprinting the daily Pages a weekend but
9:27
we'll see but what I'm going to do now
9:29
is I'm going to set this up and then I'm
9:30
going to go edit my Vlog I've been kind
9:33
of trying to keep
9:36
my to-do list here so today's list is q1
9:41
planner
9:42
Vlog edits right print out my December
9:45
pages and set up my December planner and
9:47
finish up the goals pant planner I've
9:49
already done a couple things and then I
9:51
need to also clean my bedroom so this is
9:53
sort of the daily list let's get it done
9:57
[Music]
10:04
thank you
10:07
[Music]
10:26
okay I had good intentions and then I
10:29
ended up putting the camera down and we
10:31
had some fun time as a family I kind of
10:33
sort of burned out on doing more work
10:35
for several hours and just spent time
10:37
with the kids we watched more Great
10:39
British baking show we went out to
10:40
dinner we played outside for a little
10:42
bit thank you all so much for hanging
10:44
out with me I cannot believe we only
10:45
have a handful of days left of these
10:48
daily Vlogs I have been thinking after
10:51
some of the comments that have been
10:52
going on that maybe it would be fun and
10:55
beneficial to do a monthly blog not that
10:58
will follow me through the month but
10:59
just once a month do a day in the
11:01
lifetime video where I should kind of
11:03
show what's going on with my writing and
11:05
how I'm kind of juggling everything let
11:07
me know if you think that sounds fun and
11:09
you've enjoyed these Vlogs because I
11:12
always enjoy doing them they're a lot of
11:13
fun for me but I will see you all
11:17
tomorrow and
11:19
I have
11:21
3300 words or so left to hit that iPad
11:25
so tomorrow we're aiming for the 50K
11:28
let's do this all right good night you
11:31
guys Happy writing bye
11:46
[Music]

so it's like it came down with the
0:02
confetti you won congratulations and it
0:04
said I had like 89 000 words written so
0:07
that was exciting and I was like delete
0:09
delete
0:14
[Music]
0:20
[Music]
0:29
oh
0:39
hey everybody Welcome to Day 26 I cannot
0:42
believe we are down to the last handful
0:44
of days for nanowrimo
0:46
but it is not just the end of Nano it is
0:49
also almost the beginning of December
0:51
and December is a super busy month for
0:54
me this whole Q4 of the year is always
0:57
my busiest time of year between the Nano
0:59
Diaries and the Spooktacular event that
1:01
I do for my fans but then of course in
1:03
December it's all about planning and
1:05
goal setting so we've got hb90 which by
1:08
the time you watch this should be live
1:10
so the link to join us down below if you
1:12
want to come join us to help plan for
1:14
your schedule in 2023 and so I am busy
1:19
today this is probably one of the
1:21
busiest days of my entire year
1:25
and so I thought it would be kind of fun
1:26
to bring you along in a day in my life
1:29
of a busy entrepreneur and I will just
1:32
go ahead and caveat this by saying this
1:34
is not to Champion like the hustle
1:36
culture in fact this is to say that we
1:40
all are going to have periods of time if
1:42
we're entrepreneurs if we're running our
1:44
own business be it a writing business or
1:46
multiple businesses full-time job with
1:47
multiple businesses whatever your
1:49
situation is
1:51
it's unrealistic to think that we're
1:53
going to be able to just do a little bit
1:55
of work and just never have to like work
1:57
hard because there are going to be
1:59
Seasons when we're launching a new
2:01
product or when we're hitting a deadline
2:02
or when we have just extra things have
2:05
sort of culminated into a single weekend
2:06
of everything needs to get done that is
2:10
just a part of the life of an
2:11
entrepreneur is part of the cycle now I
2:13
don't stay this busy all year and I
2:16
couldn't sustain this level of busyness
2:19
but I did want to talk about it in the
2:21
fact that we are going to have periods
2:24
in our career seasons in our career that
2:26
are more busy than others that are more
2:30
hustle feeling than others where we do
2:32
have to get a lot done in a shorter span
2:34
of time in order to finish everything
2:36
that we want to do
2:37
and what I want to be able to show you
2:39
is how over the course of multiple years
2:42
of using my own hb90 system and really
2:45
trying to think about my own joy and put
2:48
Joy at the Forefront of my career I have
2:51
learned how to make it through these
2:53
kinds of days without getting super
2:55
stressed and by checking in on my mental
2:58
health because I will tell you just a
3:00
little brief story of when I was first
3:03
getting started with YouTube and was
3:05
behind on some of my books I would have
3:09
weekends where I was trying to like
3:11
design the hb90 planner and do some
3:13
other stuff like that where I would
3:15
literally end up like in tears or
3:18
actually throwing things across the room
3:20
which I'm not proud of but that was how
3:23
stressed I was trying to get as much
3:25
done as I was and I just didn't know how
3:28
to cope or how to handle trying to be
3:30
stressed enough to make these businesses
3:32
fly and what I have learned since then
3:35
is that it it's so important to
3:39
understand what are my non-negotiables
3:41
what are the things that have to get
3:43
done and what are the things that it's
3:44
okay if they slide and to be able to
3:47
check in with myself throughout the day
3:49
and say okay how are we doing how are we
3:51
feeling looking for those warning signs
3:53
that maybe I'm working a little bit too
3:55
hard or maybe I'm starting to get
3:56
stressed and before I boil over I take a
4:00
break if I need it and I don't apologize
4:02
for it I don't feel guilty for it I just
4:04
take the breaks when I need them one of
4:06
those things is it's already 10 15 this
4:09
morning and I have spent the morning
4:11
just being super lazy I slept in you
4:14
know till about seven I
4:16
spent time with Evie we played a little
4:19
game we have boxes set up for her so she
4:22
wanted me to sit inside the boxes and
4:23
pretend to be a doctor so she brought me
4:25
little stuffed animals to doctor and
4:27
stuff like that so I played with the
4:29
kids I got a healthy breakfast I got
4:31
took the time to get ready for the day
4:33
so that I feel like I could turn on the
4:35
camera and um you know just feel like
4:37
I'm energetic for some reason like
4:39
getting ready for the day energizes me
4:41
and then I took time to write out my
4:44
to-do list now I'm not doing it in my A5
4:46
binder because it's too heavy to carry
4:49
around and I need to work at multiple
4:50
desks today so I put it in my B6 stalogy
4:53
so I wanted to take you along with me to
4:56
show you kind of a day in the life of a
4:58
busy entrepreneur not to say everybody
5:01
should hustle and be you know busier but
5:04
to say that there are naturally going to
5:06
be Seasons that are busy like this no
5:09
matter how well we plan most of us will
5:11
come across weekends or days that we've
5:14
got to get a lot done in a short period
5:15
of time but that there is a way to do it
5:18
that you're not necessarily hustling
5:20
you're just following through and
5:21
checking in on yourself and taking care
5:23
of your mental health and making sure
5:25
that you're enjoying the process as much
5:27
as possible it doesn't have to be
5:28
torturous it can actually just be really
5:30
fun to make your dreams come true and
5:33
know that there's going to be positive
5:35
results from this so it might be a
5:36
little bit of a longer Vlog but I'm
5:38
going to take you along with me so let
5:39
me show you what's in my planner to do
5:41
and then we're going to get started
5:43
okay so just kind of chicken scratched
5:46
in here I'm not trying to make this nice
5:47
because I don't have time to fancy
5:49
things up but I need to choose a
5:51
notebook challenge winner I need to pack
5:52
and order any pack yeah pack and order
5:55
any remaining giveaways from my
5:57
Spooktacular in October I need to create
5:59
a scavenger hunt gifts and send them to
6:01
my assistant I need to check the book
6:03
order versus the books received because
6:05
I haven't gotten everything that I
6:06
ordered from my book signing I want to
6:09
tidy up my office because it is a big
6:11
mess and I need to make it a workable
6:13
space for the next couple of days I need
6:16
to work on the sales page for hb90
6:17
because we're going to sales page 2.0
6:20
and teachable I need to send out
6:22
affiliate emails I need to edit the day
6:24
25 Vlog I need to work on the 2023 goals
6:27
planner and get it to the proofreader
6:29
and to my digital Creator and then I
6:31
need to get my writing done and the
6:33
ironic thing is the three most important
6:36
things are kind of down here at the
6:37
bottom and then I also have more stuff
6:40
going on tomorrow and Monday and
6:42
anything that doesn't get done today can
6:44
get kind of pushed over but the course
6:46
is opening on Sunday so like all the
6:49
course creation stuff has to get done so
6:53
when I come in here and I start kind of
6:55
looking at what's most important the
6:58
affiliate emails have to go out today
7:00
this is like a must-have and the sales
7:02
page has to get done today so these are
7:03
the two things that like above all else
7:05
that has to get done I also have my
7:08
daily Vlogs that need to get finished so
7:11
those are my like top three must do and
7:14
then I want to be getting my writing in
7:16
so everything else can wait if it needs
7:19
to but I have these four priorities and
7:23
so I'm going to tackle as much of that
7:25
as I can first I probably will wait to
7:28
do my writing again later in the evening
7:30
when the kids aren't around because that
7:32
has been working for me throughout Nano
7:34
but I know that in order to get that
7:36
done I need to have everything else done
7:38
by like five o'clock so that I can have
7:40
a long three hour break to really hang
7:43
out with the kids do a nice dinner chill
7:46
out before I come back in to do my
7:47
writing so these three things and as
7:49
much of this other stuff needs to get
7:51
done so it is currently it's 10 12 in
7:54
the morning
7:58
[Music]
8:05
so I checked in with my assistant on
8:06
Marco Polo and I wrote down when I'm
8:09
getting started on this task so that I
8:12
have a record of how long everything
8:14
took me in terms of 30 minute task
8:16
blocks and I have everything imported
8:18
and now I'm ready to open up Premiere
8:20
Pro and get started on today's vlog
8:23
[Music]
8:29
foreign
8:34
[Music]
8:37
okay so lunch is eaten I did make my bed
8:41
this morning which I'm trying to be good
8:44
about Andrew is over there on the
8:46
treadmill getting his exercise in for
8:48
the day and I'm gonna go work on
8:51
affiliate sale
8:52
[Music]
8:54
also in my break time I've also been
8:57
doing some laundry
8:58
ah it's just you know it's a lot of
9:01
things when you're a mom and a business
9:04
owner so we're getting it done
9:09
foreign
9:11
[Music]
9:17
[Music]
9:53
okay so I was able to design some
9:56
digital goodies that are going to go out
9:58
to some winners for my spectacular stuff
10:00
so I've got that in a folder for Renee
10:03
so I get to move that one off the list
10:05
so I did order the remaining giveaways
10:07
but I still need to pack One giveaway
10:10
that's still left to go and I also did
10:13
the books work but I need to actually go
10:16
check the rest of the orders but I did
10:17
forget to order or somehow missed
10:19
ordering a couple of the books so I need
10:21
to get those in but a lot is done on the
10:24
list except that this thing right here
10:26
the 2023 goals planner and the writing
10:29
are kind of the longest things that I
10:31
have to work on today so
10:33
um it's not too bad though 2 30 and I've
10:35
gotten a lot done so what I'm going to
10:36
do now is I'm going to go pack that
10:38
final giveaway and check the books
10:42
[Music]
10:45
foreign
10:46
[Music]
10:58
back upstairs to send out affiliate
11:01
emails to all of the hb90 affiliates
11:04
busy day but it's not even three so I'm
11:07
ahead of the game
11:08
so here's Evie's house that she made
11:11
looks very nice you did a good job yeah
11:14
foreign
11:16
it's a little splotchy
11:18
[Music]
11:23
right so I have enlisted George's help
11:27
he always helps with the affiliate
11:28
emails because he knows how to code so
11:30
he can send them all out
11:31
programmatically so that is done only
11:34
things left on my list are the goals
11:36
planner and to write for the day and to
11:39
clean my office so it is a little bit
11:41
after three yeah you want to come help
11:43
me
11:44
so Evie's gonna come help me clean up my
11:46
office and then I will get to work on
11:48
the goals planner for a couple hours
11:50
okay slight adjustment to the plan
11:52
because doing a little bit of a check-in
11:55
with myself after finishing the
11:57
affiliate stuff and then sitting there
11:58
with Evie for a few minutes I realized
12:01
okay my eyes are starting to get tired
12:03
and even though I was gonna do something
12:05
that was off screens to clean my desk I
12:08
also thought this is the perfect time to
12:11
take a little bit of a break because the
12:12
kids have screens again at 3 30 for an
12:14
hour so I can sneak away to go get my
12:18
daily Starbucks and since I didn't get
12:20
one yesterday I may grab two today so
12:22
that I can put one in the fridge for
12:24
tomorrow I think it's a good time to
12:25
kind of get away and then I can sort of
12:27
sing and play music in the car go get my
12:29
Starbucks come home and then I will
12:31
clean up and then I'll have probably
12:33
about an hour and a half to work on the
12:35
planner and then it'll be family time so
12:38
I don't think I'm gonna finish the
12:40
planner today but we'll see how far I
12:41
can get also I know I need to cut my
12:44
roses back but they're blooming so
12:47
nicely and it's super windy today but I
12:49
think I need to to wait for these to
12:51
bloom and then cut them back if you know
12:52
anything about cutting roses back let me
12:55
know because this particular bush is
12:57
getting out of control
12:58
[Music]
13:08
okay Starbucks acquired I have a vanilla
13:11
blonde latte and then I also got the
13:15
same thing but in cold with no ice so
13:18
that I can just put this in the fridge
13:20
and add ice to it tomorrow now I'm going
13:22
to talk to some of my besties or listen
13:25
to some messages on Marco Polo and play
13:27
some music and we're gonna head home
13:29
home coffee in hand and while I do feel
13:33
refreshed I don't feel like going and
13:37
sitting on my computer and staring at
13:39
the screen so the other thing on the
13:41
list for today besides writing which I'm
13:44
just made plans with my friend Jen to
13:47
meet up to do Sprints together at nine
13:48
tonight
13:50
I've got to clean this office so it's a
13:54
big old mess and I'm just gonna get as
13:57
much of it done as I can I'm probably
13:59
gonna set a timer for 20 minutes get as
14:01
much done in here as I can to get it
14:03
back to a normal working space and then
14:07
I will go up and work for about an hour
14:10
on the planner
14:21
foreign
14:35
s it took longer to get this room where
14:37
I wanted it to be and it is 4 56 so I
14:42
can tell you though it felt so good and
14:44
I can already tell that my eyes are like
14:46
relaxing a little bit I'm feeling more
14:48
energetic after some coffee and music
14:51
kind of cleaning things up always makes
14:53
me feel a little bit better too so now
14:56
George is probably going to start
14:58
cooking pretty soon for us so I'm gonna
15:00
get as much work as I can done on the
15:03
goals planner and then I'm probably
15:05
going to call it a night with the family
15:06
until about 9pm tonight when I'm gonna
15:09
write with my friend Jen so very
15:11
successful yet very busy day but this is
15:14
the main thing is when you've been on
15:16
screens too long and you've been
15:17
focusing it can help if you have other
15:19
things on your to-do list that are
15:22
either just relaxing or productive like
15:24
cleaning up your space but getting your
15:27
eyes off the computer giving yourself a
15:30
little bit of a treat like some coffee
15:31
or a walk around the block or some time
15:34
with your favorite playlist all that can
15:36
help you get through a busy day and even
15:38
though it can seem like you're taking
15:39
time out of your tasks it's actually
15:41
going to help you refocus and get back
15:44
to the work that needs to be done
15:47
[Music]
16:02
556 and I have made it to a page 174 of
16:06
my planner which is part of the way
16:08
through Q3 so there's still a few hours
16:11
left to do and this is just the like
16:13
Sunday Monday and start mix planner and
16:16
then I have to do the Monday start
16:17
planner which takes not quite as much
16:19
time as this but it will still take
16:21
several hours so it's unlikely I'm gonna
16:24
finish this planner today which is a
16:26
little bit disappointing because I
16:27
really wanted to send it off to a
16:29
proofreader but there's George telling
16:32
me it's dinner time so that's probably
16:35
the most I'm gonna get done on this
16:36
to-do list other than I'm gonna get some
16:38
writing done at nine tonight so busy day
16:41
sometimes I have to just sort of step
16:43
away and say it's okay that I didn't get
16:45
everything done but I knew that this
16:48
might go over into tomorrow but if you
16:51
look at the things that I highlighted
16:53
those things got done unaccept the
16:55
writing so as long as I sit down and
16:56
write for a couple Sprints tonight it
16:58
was a successful day so I'm ready to
17:01
open up hb90 tomorrow everything's good
17:03
to go and now and now it's time for
17:04
family time look at this sunset
17:08
we can't stay outside
17:10
I know that's not going to show up as
17:11
beautifully on screen as it does in life
17:15
but wow the sunsets here are just
17:18
gorgeous and I'm catching the tail end
17:20
of it but I'm so grateful do you love
17:22
that Evie
17:24
it is called
17:26
yeah let's go inside
17:28
okay so the kids actually wanted to be
17:30
on screens for a bit so we watched some
17:32
of the Great British baking show no
17:34
spoilers because we're only on season or
17:36
episode three of the most recent season
17:37
so we're still we're still in it but I
17:42
was able to take another hour and I
17:43
finished most of the goals planner
17:45
except for the Q3 and Q4 like welcome
17:47
message so I'm really close to being
17:49
done I might just spend one more Sprint
17:51
working on it or I'll finish it up in
17:53
the morning but Evie is in the bath so
17:56
I'm going to take this opportunity to
18:00
finish up her laundry and then get her
18:02
to bed by reading her a book and
18:04
snuggling with her for a little bit so
18:06
we're almost through to the writing
18:09
okay it is 8 30. I got to spend some
18:11
good time with Evie in her room I read
18:14
her a few books we cuddled and now she
18:17
is reading with George and going to
18:19
sleep
18:20
and I'm sitting down to do my writing
18:23
for the night and I actually feel pretty
18:25
good
18:26
and I'm excited so I'm making some tea
18:28
I'm going to meet up with my friend Jen
18:30
here at nine o'clock I'm gonna see if
18:32
she wants to jump on early and I just
18:34
wanted to say that what I feel like
18:36
makes such a big difference for me is
18:39
when I know I have a really big busy day
18:42
coming up I approach it with Clarity
18:45
first of all I make that list of exactly
18:47
what tasks need to get done and also a
18:51
crucial part is identifying which of
18:53
those tasks are the most important to
18:54
get done today because then that gives
18:57
me permission that as long as those
18:59
three things like I can't set eight out
19:01
of the 10 as must do today because I
19:04
need to give myself a little bit of
19:05
leeway but if I can pick those like top
19:08
two or three maybe four tasks that need
19:10
to get done today then I know that I can
19:14
give myself permission to sort of rest
19:17
or tap out if I need to and just knowing
19:20
as I go throughout the day that I've got
19:22
that out I have that ability to take
19:25
control all of my time and say you know
19:27
what I'm not feeling as good as I
19:29
thought I don't have as much energy my
19:31
brain is having some brain fog I'm just
19:33
going to focus on these couple of things
19:34
and then I'm going to do the rest
19:35
tomorrow but going in with focus and
19:38
then giving myself permission to slow
19:41
down take breaks or just completely stop
19:44
working in the middle of the day if I
19:46
need it also gives me a sense of joy and
19:51
relief so instead of pushing hustle go
19:54
go go gotta get it done regardless of
19:56
how I feel that you know that kind of
19:58
hustle pressure just only makes me feel
20:01
more stressed and I have learned over
20:03
time that if I just tell myself it's
20:05
going to be okay whether it gets done or
20:07
not these things are not the end of the
20:09
world I'm not trying to cure world
20:10
hunger here I'm not like no Wars are
20:12
gonna break out because I don't get this
20:13
stuff done worst case scenario I would
20:16
have to make an announcement that the
20:17
course opens on Monday instead of Sunday
20:19
and that would be okay so just putting
20:22
it in that perspective of like it's okay
20:23
if I'm not perfect I get as much done as
20:25
I can and I lead with joy and that makes
20:30
everything so much more manageable
20:32
and so here I am sitting down at 8 30
20:34
feeling pretty good so I'm gonna go
20:37
steep my tea I'm gonna open my well
20:40
actually I have my document open here
20:42
and I'm gonna light my candle and I'm
20:45
hoping I can write for about an hour and
20:47
a half tonight and I'm hoping I can get
20:48
at least a thousand to 1500 words and
20:51
we're still climbing our way
20:53
um so let's do it
20:57
[Music]
21:10
thank you
21:14
[Music]
21:16
thank you
21:17
[Music]
21:26
this last Sprint was a struggle and I am
21:30
up to 44
21:31
978 words however
21:34
when I went into the Nano website
21:37
I told them I had 44 978 words but
21:41
apparently I put it in as I had a Sprint
21:44
that was 44 000 words long
21:48
so it's like it came down with the
21:50
confetti you won congratulations and it
21:52
said I had like 89 000 words written so
21:55
that was exciting and I was like delete
21:58
delete
22:00
so I was able to go and delete it but
22:03
for a moment I was standing in the sun
22:06
of winning Nano with a beautiful
22:08
confetti falling so that was kind of
22:10
funny
22:11
but I'm only 22 words away from 45 000
22:15
um Rhiannon and Angela are almost done
22:17
with their Sprints but I'm gonna try to
22:19
do one more I've been kind of like
22:21
hanging out with my friend Jen on Marco
22:23
Polo and watching Rhiannon and Angela
22:25
Sprint in the writing Community but I'm
22:27
gonna do one last Sprint and then I'm
22:30
gonna call it a night because it is 10
22:31
p.m and as you well know I've been
22:34
working pretty much non-stop since 10
22:36
a.m and I have a big day again tomorrow
22:37
as hb90 launches so if you see this and
22:41
you think gosh I really want to try my
22:44
hand at a new way of planning where I am
22:46
realistic about my time and I take
22:50
self-care into account and I can promise
22:54
you that if you are looking forward to a
22:57
way of arranging your time better and
22:59
getting a real sense of how much time
23:01
you actually have versus planning for
23:04
how much time you wish you had then I
23:06
promise this course can help you so if
23:08
you want to come join us we open the
23:10
doors tomorrow and the kick call is
23:12
December 11th so I'll also be in the
23:16
comments tomorrow of this video if you
23:18
have any questions about the course but
23:20
it's going to be great
23:22
um I hope you'll join us and if you're
23:24
an alumni of course you can always join
23:25
us again for free so I'm also working on
23:28
the 2023 planners in the q1 planner so
23:31
those will be done in a couple of days
23:32
so
23:33
that is it for tonight for me I'm gonna
23:36
hit this 45k and then I am out gonna get
23:41
a full night's sleep hopefully eight
23:43
hours of sleep tonight and then I will
23:45
see you guys tomorrow Happy writing bye
23:52
[Music]
24:00
thank you
I am technically at tomorrow's par so
0:03
I'm still ahead but I have a confession
0:06
to make
0:11
[Music]
0:17
[Music]
0:25
thank you
0:33
hey you guys so I'm not recording until
0:36
late tonight because it has just been
0:39
one thing after another it's such a busy
0:41
time of year because I've got hb90
0:44
course it's opening on Sunday so by the
0:47
time you see this I'll have less than 24
0:49
hours to get that course open and
0:51
there's a lot of little things that go
0:53
into getting everything set up getting
0:54
the planners ready I'm working on the
0:56
2023 planners I'm working on the q1
0:59
planners and so there's like a total of
1:02
16 planners to design and yes I did try
1:04
to Outsource this at one point and they
1:07
messed up so badly and I spent so much
1:09
money that I was like okay I'm doing it
1:11
myself so I've got those planners to get
1:14
done I have not had any time to write
1:16
since the night before last so I'm
1:18
making a priority tonight I just got
1:21
done reading a book from my friend
1:24
Angela Hester called A is for ant eater
1:27
is the first in a series of Adventures
1:29
from A to Z and it was so much fun to
1:33
read a book that I know not only a
1:35
friend of mine but also a student of my
1:38
publish and Thrive course has created
1:41
and published it's a children's book and
1:43
Evie loved it she was like read it again
1:45
and then she was like I want to know
1:47
what happens when they go to the zoo so
1:49
I told her we'll get B is for backpack
1:51
is coming soon so I think that kids will
1:54
really love being able to follow those
1:55
books and I think it's super clever idea
1:57
to write them in a series of like one
2:00
continuing Adventure so good job Angela
2:02
I'm so proud of you
2:05
um but anyway that was fun and now I've
2:08
got to get to work but as I was starting
2:10
to get to work I was really not only in
2:12
this room noticing how messy it is
2:15
because this is what always happens to
2:17
me as I get busier and busier is my
2:19
house gets a little bit Messier and a
2:21
little bit Messier and then I have a
2:24
moment where it's like for the New Year
2:25
I'll clean everything up or when we
2:28
decorate for Christmas but it's so hard
2:30
you know people ask about how how do you
2:32
maintain balance and it's like sometimes
2:34
you just can't maintain balance and you
2:37
have to set your priorities and it's
2:39
like I'm either going to have a little
2:41
bit of time with the kids or I'm going
2:43
to be able to clean up this room and
2:45
tomorrow I actually can maybe take some
2:47
time to put on some music and have Evie
2:49
in here with me kind of dancing around
2:51
while we clean but to get the whole
2:53
house clean and make it perfect is not
2:56
my priority right now
2:58
it's really more getting my work done
3:00
and spending time with the kids so it's
3:02
always you know ups and downs and
3:06
choices life is all about choices and
3:09
it's really all about making them as
3:12
intentionally as possible so that you
3:14
know what it is you're spending your
3:16
time on rather than just letting it
3:18
steal your time being actually
3:20
intentional about that so if that
3:22
resonates with you at all then maybe you
3:24
would like to join us in the hb90 course
3:26
coming up this weekend but I was in here
3:30
um looking at the mess and kind of
3:31
cleaning up a few things but I was also
3:33
moving a few things down my board and
3:35
you guys look at this like this is my
3:39
goal this is my writing goal let me turn
3:41
this around so if you are new here
3:43
because you just discovered me for
3:45
preptober or nanowrimo these are my
3:47
kanban boards which are really my three
3:49
major goals every quarter I will reset
3:52
these and that is basically what I do in
3:55
my hb90 course it's a system I developed
3:57
for myself to try to get more done and
4:01
to make those intentional choices so I
4:03
don't end up sacrificing something that
4:04
I didn't mean to sacrifice and so that I
4:07
can keep the me like needle moving
4:09
forward on my career without working
4:11
myself over hard so uh anyway I use
4:16
these kanban boards by setting up my
4:19
goals for the quarter at the beginning
4:20
of the quarter so for this quarter it
4:22
was October 1st or so when I had these
4:24
all set but for the past couple of years
4:27
not even kidding this first goal which
4:30
is my writing goal every time has
4:33
languished and it has been really
4:35
difficult to get everything done and I
4:37
cannot even express to you the joy of
4:40
sitting here being so close like I am
4:43
only at 42 well I won't say only I'm at
4:46
42 000 something for Nano but before
4:49
Nano began I wrote almost 7 000 words so
4:51
I'm getting very close to 50 000 words
4:54
in my manuscript and that still isn't
4:57
going to finish the book like the book
4:58
is going to be at least I think 85 to
5:00
90k but just to know that I have moved
5:04
these down and I still have a full month
5:07
to work on it is huge so I've got what's
5:10
left is the book my coffee chat some
5:12
newsletter and Social Media stuff and
5:14
then I have edits on this book so if I
5:17
don't finish it in December those edits
5:19
will just move to January but if all I
5:21
end up with is this one little set of
5:23
Post-its that didn't get done I'm gonna
5:26
be just like Dancing On The Ceiling I'm
5:28
gonna be so excited and then preptober
5:32
and everything went here like all my
5:34
preptober videos are done nanowrimo
5:37
Diaries I move one down every day so
5:41
um I think I just posted the day 24 Vlog
5:43
and today's the 25th I'm running out of
5:46
ideas there or I'm I'm losing track of
5:49
time now this goal is my six months for
5:52
Life goal and I was hoping to work on
5:55
some these are just kind of like
5:56
personal goals and I was hoping to work
5:58
on these a little bit more but I just
6:01
sort of a month and realized I was going
6:04
to be too busy so it was going to be
6:05
again a choice between do I focus on the
6:08
writing or do I focus on like trying to
6:11
do more Vlogs for this or losing weight
6:14
or anything like that now there are a
6:16
few of these things that are in process
6:17
that'll move down soon but overall
6:19
it's just the writing one for me that
6:22
I'm like so proud of myself right now
6:24
and really excited for what 2023 brings
6:28
which then brings me to the fact that
6:30
I've mentioned this a few times
6:31
throughout the Nano Vlogs that I'm just
6:35
chomping at the bit to start thinking
6:37
about my plan for 2023 and how I want to
6:41
set up my planners what I want to
6:44
accomplish what projects are going to be
6:46
the most important because I have a lot
6:48
of things on my plate and things that I
6:50
want to do next year that I've never
6:51
done before and I know I'm going to have
6:54
to make space for that and right now I
6:56
have zero space I'm trying to stay
6:58
Solutions oriented and start thinking
7:00
about what I can cut out what I can do
7:03
who I can hire like how I can get help
7:06
and making sure that my priority is
7:09
always like I want to continue I don't
7:11
want my work to get so big that I lose
7:14
track of this writing because now that
7:16
I'm on
7:17
momentum now that I'm on a positive
7:19
streak I want to keep that up but I also
7:21
don't want to like not post YouTube
7:23
videos or not take care of my health you
7:26
know so it's all a matter of really
7:29
sitting down to think about what those
7:30
priorities are and planning with
7:32
intention and I'm so ready to do it so
7:35
I'm really looking forward to hb90 not
7:37
only for my students but for myself
7:39
because I really love New Year's you
7:43
guys know how much I love a fresh start
7:44
and new year's is the freshest fresh
7:47
start of the Year obviously and I'm so
7:49
ready for it it's like this will be our
7:52
first full year in this house it'll be a
7:55
time for great opportunity and hopefully
7:57
great creativity I feel like there are
8:00
some really great things on the horizon
8:03
and I'm just excited and I don't think
8:05
I've been this happy in a really long
8:07
time and it feels good so having that
8:09
bit of gratitude but it's also 8 30 and
8:13
I haven't written today and I still need
8:15
to work on the planner so let's get to
8:18
writing oh I forgot to mention that I
8:21
got the new nanowrimo hoodie in it says
8:24
nanowrimo writer and it has the key this
8:27
is a design from a few years ago but
8:29
this was on pre-order I got the large
8:32
and it is a little bit too big and I
8:35
love it that way a little bit oversized
8:38
of a hoodie and it's perfect and it's
8:40
super comfy there's nothing on the back
8:42
it's just that one little design and I
8:44
think these are available right now on
8:46
the Nano site
8:48
um I really feel like man I need to
8:50
order that winter shirt because I'm
8:51
gonna hit it let's do this we've got
8:53
less than a week left to go we are on
8:56
the final stretch and
8:58
I'm ready to win this thing let's do it
9:15
okay first Sprint 801 words but I am
9:21
struggling to keep my eyes open and I'm
9:23
getting easily distracted by things that
9:26
I keep thinking I want to buy and see if
9:27
they're on sale for Black Friday let me
9:29
know in the comments did you do any
9:31
shopping I have done massive amounts of
9:34
shopping today for things that we need
9:36
in the house I just bought black couch
9:37
to go back here I bought new clothes for
9:40
the kids like so much stuff Christmas
9:42
gifts
9:44
um new hanging like floating shelves for
9:46
the uh kitchen area there's just like
9:49
it's going through my head like blah
9:51
blah blah trying to save money on those
9:52
deals and I'm like I'm running out of
9:55
time but I need to be writing
9:58
so I did get 801 words they may not be
10:01
my best ever but I did get those I also
10:04
walked out to the mailbox
10:07
which is a bit of a trek it's not like
10:09
just right outside the house it's down
10:11
the road a bit and I got these super
10:13
cute paper clips from to do papel or
10:17
Toto papel I got some for Halloween as
10:21
well that they did that were so cute but
10:22
this one's like a little gingerbread
10:24
house and a pink Christmas tree and then
10:28
sorry for the lighting there a little
10:30
Mickey or Minnie Mouse and a little
10:34
cocoa cup so those are cute and then I
10:38
also have gotten some very cute little
10:40
dashboards I can't remember if these
10:42
came from Glam girl planners or the
10:45
planner babe or something like that but
10:48
they are super cute little Christmasy
10:50
ones and on my coffee chat that I had
10:52
today I was asking people should I use
10:56
the new sort of pink Erin Condren that
10:58
looks really nice with that
11:02
um pink in the
11:04
dashboard or should I use red and I'm
11:08
kind of leaning toward even though I
11:09
would like to use the new thing I'm kind
11:11
of leaning toward red so I'm hoping to
11:13
actually take some time this weekend to
11:16
print out all of my December planner
11:18
pages and get my new planner set up
11:20
especially now that I have this
11:24
like little extras to decorate with so
11:26
I'm pretty excited for that as well
11:29
but I need to write at least one more
11:32
Sprint I am technically at tomorrow's
11:35
par so I'm still ahead but I have a
11:39
confession to make
11:41
I actually went ahead this morning and
11:44
bought my iPad
11:46
um now don't freak out
11:48
uh I was looking originally at the Apple
11:51
website
11:52
but then when I started looking at
11:55
Amazon for some of the other things that
11:56
I needed it's cheaper by like a couple
11:59
hundred dollars on Amazon and I wasn't
12:02
sure if that's a Black Friday deal or a
12:04
normal thing and so I was like okay I
12:06
know I'm gonna win so I'm just gonna go
12:07
ahead and order it so it'll be here on
12:10
Tuesday next week so I'm hoping I can
12:13
hit the 50K by the time it arrives so
12:15
that I can actually open it and use it
12:17
right when it comes in my husband was
12:19
like what are you gonna do if you don't
12:21
win I was like well if I don't win then
12:22
I have to return it so let's not let
12:26
that happen I am calling it in that I'm
12:29
going to win so I can't give up yet
12:31
tonight I want to get this win so one
12:35
more Sprint and then I need to go work
12:39
on my hb90 planners just a little bit
12:41
more except that maybe I'm just gonna
12:43
chill out a little bit because the other
12:46
thing I've been getting distracted by is
12:48
this
12:49
notion
12:51
so I am working on
12:54
several things for next year uh and in
12:58
terms of my planner stuff getting things
13:00
set up
13:01
changing the way I'm doing some things
13:03
and one of the things that I'm going to
13:05
be doing is switching out
13:08
some of my planners and notebooks for
13:11
notion I already have you can kind of
13:14
see up here Renee has named so Renee and
13:17
I work together in this workspace and
13:19
she has named my heartbreathing stuff
13:21
heartlandia and we have all of our like
13:24
tasks and projects and stuff that we
13:26
work on as a team so then I named my
13:29
little private space Sarah's world and I
13:31
do have a Tarot Journal here that I
13:32
purchased from somebody online that I
13:34
never have fully set up but it's so so
13:36
cute and I would love to use this here
13:38
as well but I have spent some time just
13:42
kind of randomly over the last few weeks
13:46
setting up this notion dashboard I
13:50
have some ideas of I had taken you guys
13:53
through
13:54
some of the like writing journal and
13:56
tracking some of that stuff in notion
13:59
before but I spent all the time in the
14:02
world setting it up and then I only used
14:04
it for about a month and then I was back
14:06
in my paper planner so that may end up
14:08
being true again for me this year I
14:12
might set it all up and notion if you
14:14
aren't familiar really is a blank slate
14:17
when you start there's nothing here
14:19
there's no structure and you have to
14:20
create all your pages all your databases
14:22
everything so it's really easy to get
14:25
lost in it in terms of like spending all
14:28
your time setting it up looking for
14:30
cuter widgets looking at how to cross
14:32
databases watching videos on how to do
14:34
it so it's in some ways I feel like
14:37
maybe it's me procrastin planning a
14:39
little bit by sitting here like wanting
14:43
to work on this and figure it out but
14:45
it's also me realizing that as my
14:47
businesses grow it's time for me to
14:50
start thinking about adding to my team
14:52
I'm probably going to be hiring a second
14:54
person in next year there's a lot that
14:57
needs to happen in terms of team
15:00
management and that is difficult to do
15:02
when you're only working in paper
15:03
planning and I'm starting to realize
15:05
that that is definitely a something that
15:08
would hold me back if I only did paper
15:10
planning stuff so I need to also have
15:14
this dashboard have all of my projects
15:16
have my calendar where my assistant and
15:19
whoever else comes in can see it and can
15:21
work with me so I'm understanding that
15:25
in the month of December I would really
15:27
like to have some of this in place so
15:30
that I can begin to
15:32
like practice it test it see what's
15:35
going to work so that I can get it all
15:36
set up and by January 1st be like Off to
15:39
the Races with a system that's actually
15:41
working for me and that feels good
15:44
but right now it's just a distraction
15:46
and it's because I'm tired and it's been
15:48
a really long couple of days slash few
15:51
months and I am just uh starting to get
15:55
easily distractible and so like I had
15:58
mentioned in a previous Vlog that is a
16:00
Surefire sign that I'm just kind of
16:02
pushing myself to a limit so um I think
16:06
I'm just not going to work on my hb90
16:08
planners tonight I know a lot of people
16:09
want them out but I can only do what I
16:12
can do so I am going to do one more like
16:16
15 minute Sprint see if I can cross over
16:18
the 1200 word Mark to stay kind of ahead
16:22
and then I'm gonna just go to bed early
16:25
[Music]
16:42
okay
16:47
I did it
16:49
uh just an Evidence of how hard this has
16:54
been to stay focused when I started I
16:57
had literally like
16:59
I have I always have these pin tabs but
17:01
I had like two tabs open now I have like
17:04
seven tabs open
17:06
and I know that it's just because as I'm
17:08
writing then I'm like oh I should check
17:10
and see if so-and-so has a deal oh I
17:12
should check this oh I need to look up
17:14
this other thing and it's like I just
17:16
keep getting distracted but I still
17:18
manage to get 495 words so I'm at 12.96
17:22
for the day it just took me longer than
17:25
I had hoped to get there so it is almost
17:27
10 p.m I'm ready for bed I'm gonna go to
17:31
sleep early and wake up tomorrow
17:33
refreshed
17:35
and 100 percent
17:38
excited to start signing some of my
17:41
books to get the hb90 planner get the
17:44
course going and I think I'm gonna go
17:46
kind of open these up play around with
17:48
them a little bit and get some sleep so
17:50
I hope that you have had a successful
17:51
day hopefully I can get my writing
17:53
started a little bit earlier tomorrow
17:55
too so I'm not quite so tired because I
17:58
want that iPad it's going to be mine so
18:01
let me know in the comments if you have
18:03
officially one Nano and just as a little
18:06
bit of a side note
18:07
tis the season where if you're in
18:10
writer's groups or you're watching and
18:11
following people on YouTube You're Going
18:13
to start seeing a lot of I did it I won
18:15
I won I won and if you are nowhere near
18:20
that 50k which was me last year
18:23
just know that you are just as good as
18:26
any of those other writers it just was a
18:28
more challenging month for you in terms
18:30
of getting those words in but it doesn't
18:32
actually mean anything about how good of
18:34
a writer you are how much you want the
18:37
stream how worthy you are of the stream
18:39
it just means that you didn't write 50
18:41
000 words in a month and instead you got
18:44
some other number that hopefully feels
18:46
really good or instead you made other
18:48
choices for yourself that were what you
18:50
needed right now so if you hear those
18:53
numbers those wins going off just cheer
18:55
for them and know that as long as you
18:58
are moving forward and you're not giving
19:00
up you are winning too all right you
19:03
guys I'll see you tomorrow Happy writing

Hello everybody welcome back to the
1:00
nanowrimo Diaries so today it is actual
1:04
Thanksgiving day so I have some of our
1:06
stuff that you saw we bought at HEB let
1:09
me say I hate going to the grocery store
1:12
right before big holiday to get all my
1:15
groceries and I was so impressed with
1:17
the HEB because they just had so many
1:19
people like restocking stuff so one of
1:22
my things that I am grateful for today
1:24
which I like to spend the entire day
1:25
just really shouting out and thinking of
1:28
things that I'm grateful for is that we
1:31
were able to get everything that we
1:32
needed for the holiday and that it was a
1:35
smooth and actual fun trip to the
1:37
grocery store instead of a stressful one
1:39
that was fun and that was great so we
1:41
did that yesterday and now today I'm
1:44
getting ready to cook so I have actually
1:46
started with a planner believe it or not
1:50
so I took my six months for Life planner
1:52
and I have made a little recipe for
1:56
myself or like a menu we are doing
1:59
things a little bit less like homemade
2:01
from scratch than normal so usually I
2:03
would make bread or rolls from scratch
2:06
and like Let It Rise and all that stuff
2:07
and this year I just decided I was not
2:10
gonna do quite as much from a scratch
2:12
type cooking so I we're gonna do rolls
2:15
we're gonna do stuffing and cranberry
2:17
sauce we're gonna do green beans with
2:19
bacon instead of buying a turkey for the
2:22
four of us which most of us are not
2:24
gonna eat it we just got sliced deli
2:27
turkey and we're gonna roll it up with
2:28
cream cheese and cut it like little
2:30
sushis and that will be good enough for
2:32
us
2:33
um because an entire turkey would just
2:35
be too much so I'm gonna make sweet
2:37
potato casserole and then for Andrew I'm
2:40
gonna make some pizza and for Evie I'm
2:42
gonna make some pasta with butter like
2:44
noodles with butter uh that way
2:46
everybody has something they love and
2:48
then we also have a pumpkin and cream
2:50
cheese pie which I've never had before
2:52
but when I saw it I was like well we
2:54
gotta try this with some Cool Whip and
2:56
ice cream and that will be our Feast for
3:00
the day and I'm excited for it it is
3:03
already 11 36 and I'm just getting
3:05
started to cook how early is too early
3:08
to open the wine
3:11
I am going to start by cleaning off all
3:14
of the counters as best I can just to
3:16
make sure everything is clean when I get
3:18
started I'll probably grab George and
3:20
have him help me get started on some
3:21
things the stuffing and the sweet potato
3:23
casserole take the longest of about an
3:26
hour each so this is the first time I
3:29
think I've ever lived in a house that
3:30
had two ovens so this will be the first
3:33
time we have used them both because I
3:35
have things that need to be at two
3:36
different temperatures so I'm gonna
3:37
start uh preheating those and getting
3:40
all the ingredients going and my writing
3:43
plan for the day so I'm sitting at just
3:45
over 42 000 words so I need less than 8
3:48
000 words to win Nano and get my iPad it
3:52
is in my cart on my phone and I am
3:55
already just waiting if I can get that
3:57
50k I'm gonna hit order let's go
3:59
wouldn't it be miraculous if there was
4:01
some kind of Black Friday deal so maybe
4:04
I'll hit it soon and be able to snag an
4:07
online deal for an iPad but I'm not
4:09
holding out too much hope for the that
4:10
but I do want to get the iPad so I'm
4:13
going to do my best to finish so my goal
4:16
for today is I would love to get to 45
4:18
000 words so I'm going to try to fit in
4:22
random 25-minute Sprints instead of
4:24
trying to do it back to back have like
4:26
okay I put this stuff in the oven I run
4:28
and do a Sprint we finish eating the
4:30
kids kind of want to take a nap or they
4:32
want to chill out with games I will go
4:34
do a Sprint and so I'm hoping I can kind
4:36
of just fit it in throughout the day
4:37
without it taking up any of my like
4:40
family time because I want to spend this
4:42
time with the kids so that's the plan
4:47
foreign
4:53
[Music]

ooh it's a productivity type checklist
0:05
[Music]
0:11
[Music]
0:28
hello my friends so if you are watching
0:31
this as this video comes out today is
0:33
Thanksgiving here in the United States
0:35
so Happy Thanksgiving to anyone
0:37
celebrating if you are not celebrating
0:39
Happy last week of nanowrimo we have one
0:43
final week to get those words in so just
0:46
keep in mind that if you are not gonna
0:50
hit the 50k that it's totally okay to
0:52
just set a different goal and say well
0:54
I'm just going to write 100 words for
0:56
these last seven days or I am going to
0:58
write a thousand words a day or I'm
1:00
going to try to write 5 000 words before
1:01
the end of Nano whatever your goal is
1:03
it's okay to adjust it and set a new
1:05
goal so that you can build positive
1:07
momentum because ending Nano feeling
1:09
disappointed in yourself doesn't really
1:11
serve you unless it motivates you to try
1:14
harder next time or to make a better
1:15
plan or something like that but really I
1:18
personally love it when I set a new goal
1:21
and I let go of the disappointment of
1:23
the past and say okay that wasn't
1:25
realistic I'm gonna still feel motivated
1:27
to do a better job next year of planning
1:29
or to just accept that this year has
1:32
been a particularly hard year or that I
1:34
have these challenges and I'm going to
1:35
be aware of those challenges but I'm
1:37
also going to end the month feeling
1:39
really proud of myself and really
1:41
excited because I set a new goal and I
1:43
built positive momentum especially
1:45
because we are getting into planning
1:48
season to get ready for 2023 and so it's
1:51
a perfect time to build up a little bit
1:54
of positive momentum and really start
1:55
thinking about what you want to grow and
1:57
build and how you want to show up in the
2:00
next year so technically I am recording
2:03
this video right here the day that you
2:05
will see it so I'm recording this on
2:07
Thursday morning
2:09
and I'm in my Hello Kitty apron which is
2:11
my favorite a gift from my sister who I
2:14
haven't seen in a very long time and I
2:16
hope I get to see
2:17
sometime in the year or so coming up
2:20
because I missed the heck out of her but
2:22
I just realized yesterday that I shared
2:26
some things in my blog that were really
2:28
vulnerable and difficult to share and
2:30
then when I got up today I thought you
2:32
know what I don't really want to share
2:34
that on Thanksgiving Day and instead I'm
2:37
just gonna leave you guys with an Erin
2:40
Condren haul which will be full of
2:41
happiness and exciting things to look at
2:44
everything in their store is 30 off so
2:47
if you shop the links down below you'll
2:48
get that 30 off and if you've never
2:51
shopped Aaron Condren before there is
2:52
another code or link down below that if
2:55
you sign up for the very first time
2:56
you'll get ten dollars off but I think
2:58
if you go to their website and you sign
2:59
up there you'll get 10 off so if you're
3:02
gonna spend more than a hundred dollars
3:04
I would use their sign up and then use
3:06
my affiliate code I would certainly
3:08
appreciate it that'd be nice
3:09
Thanksgiving gift for me but all this
3:11
stuff is so good and I love it and I
3:13
hope you love it too and that will leave
3:15
us with a happy holiday today okay and
3:19
I'm about to start cooking and enjoying
3:21
my time with my family and you guys will
3:22
see this Thanksgiving Vlog tomorrow so
3:26
let's go look at some Erin Condren stuff
3:28
okay so I've got my daily Starbucks here
3:31
and I figure since I had about 20
3:33
minutes before I have to go I am going
3:36
to show you what I got at Erin Condren
3:38
one of the first things I wanted to show
3:40
you though is the bag so if you spend
3:43
fifty dollars in the store then instead
3:45
of just getting like a regular paper bag
3:47
or something like that you get one of
3:48
these reusable bags and I don't think
3:50
that I have any in the mid-century
3:52
circles so that was a nice little extra
3:54
and I love these bags I use them all the
3:57
time
3:58
it has this little strap here so that
4:01
you can really like fold the bag up and
4:03
put the strap around it and it just
4:04
becomes this little tiny little ball
4:05
that you can throw in your bag and you
4:07
can use them for groceries or shopping
4:08
or anything and I use them all the time
4:10
because they're super cute and they come
4:12
in lots of different designs so it's
4:13
neat that you get that for free and
4:15
let's be honest what are the chances
4:17
you're leaving the store without
4:18
spending fifty dollars am I right
4:20
also I will mention that everything in
4:25
store and online is at least 30 percent
4:28
off for Black Friday and I think this
4:30
sale is only going on for a little bit
4:32
of time more I'm not sure when it ends
4:34
but if you want to grab your yearly
4:36
planner now is the perfect time to do it
4:37
with that 30 off sale so I'm going to
4:40
show you some of the stuff that I bought
4:41
let's get started okay one of the first
4:43
things I did not buy this when I was
4:45
there but you might have noticed that I
4:48
have this super cute clear cross Potty
4:50
Black crossbody bag and I love the Erin
4:52
Condren bags because they all have the
4:55
ability to take the straps and switch
4:57
them out they have a Hello Kitty strap
4:58
you'll see that I bought a new strap I
5:00
probably have maybe eight different
5:02
straps and I just knew I had to bring
5:04
this one with me but it's also kind of
5:05
cute because you can display your
5:07
planner I have my little tokidoki I have
5:09
my keys in here and then I also was able
5:12
to clip onto the side this cute little
5:14
donutella head which I got from Daiso
5:17
which was part of my 20K reward and I
5:20
didn't even know that it was going to be
5:21
like a squishy so I'm happy about that
5:23
and then I also got this hand sanitizer
5:26
from Daiso so it looked really cute on
5:28
the bag so I will link this for you down
5:30
below but they have lots of bags like if
5:32
you don't like the clear they have
5:34
canvas bags as well and then they
5:36
actually have bags that are bigger than
5:37
this so lots of cute bags of Erin
5:39
Condren
5:41
so this was probably what I was most
5:45
excited for but it's going to be hard to
5:48
show you in this clip on my desk so I'm
5:52
just going to go ahead and take it out
5:54
to show you the basics and then we'll
5:56
actually do a packing video with this
5:59
coming up but this is one of their new
6:01
mid-century circles backpacks they have
6:03
these in a flora design as well but they
6:06
have been selling out like as soon as
6:07
they get on the website they're sold out
6:09
so this one is a Navy bag and it has all
6:12
these little pockets and stuff in here
6:13
so I'm gonna do a full packing video to
6:16
show you guys what this looks like but I
6:18
just wanted to show you for now it also
6:19
has this front zipper
6:21
it has bottle pockets on both sides
6:24
and then in the back it has leather
6:26
straps so I will share this with you in
6:29
more detail coming up but these are hard
6:31
to get online so if you want one and you
6:33
see that it's in stock right now go grab
6:35
it but I was so happy they had it in the
6:37
store
6:38
okay so here's the first bag full of
6:41
stuff so we have this sticky note roll I
6:46
don't even remember seeing this online
6:48
but I'm sure that it was there and I've
6:50
just never seen it so let me open this
6:54
definitely one of the fun things about
6:55
going into the store is you see things
6:57
that you might not have noticed online
6:59
because you don't necessarily go to
7:01
every single page but this is super cute
7:03
it's just a sticky note roll and it has
7:06
a piece of tape on it but it's just
7:09
sticky paper and you pull it and it's
7:10
going to be just like a tape dispenser
7:12
so that is very cute
7:14
they also did have a few items in the
7:18
store that were not airing Condren items
7:19
that were like wonton in a million and
7:21
they also have this hola mijas Benitez
7:24
which is
7:25
um another like part of their Hispanic
7:27
Heritage Month and it's so cute this is
7:30
glitter washi tape with all these
7:32
different girls on it and then they also
7:34
had a few more things from this shop in
7:37
their store which I thought was really
7:38
nice
7:39
the bag that I got is another
7:41
collaboration
7:44
for the bag strap that I got is from
7:47
Etta V and if you have not seen any of
7:50
these stuff like if you're not following
7:52
her on Instagram you are missing out
7:54
because if you love color the way that I
7:56
do her artwork is just incredible and I
7:59
love this bag strap so I'm probably
8:01
going to go ahead and switch out that
8:04
mid-century circles with this one today
8:06
because I think this is gorgeous so I
8:09
love this Edo V strap had to have it
8:12
I'm gonna try to take everything out of
8:14
the plastic so you can see it a little
8:15
bit better but this was a set of
8:18
notepads they had like that was so cool
8:21
too in the store like they don't have
8:23
many stores I think there's only three
8:24
there's one in California one in
8:26
Virginia and then one in Austin but it
8:28
was so nice to be able to go and
8:29
actually see everything and be able to
8:31
look at it to see if you think that's
8:33
gonna work for you but hopefully you can
8:34
see a lot of it on my videos but they
8:36
have this habit tracker pad and you can
8:39
track your habits over here I like this
8:42
because I don't always stick with habit
8:43
trackers so this might be a better
8:45
solution is to actually have it out on
8:47
my desk
8:49
and then also has a goals tracker and
8:51
you guys know I like to do just days so
8:54
this will be perfect for my gist days I
8:56
can say what my intention is have my
8:57
checklist and then I can Journal down
8:59
here I can write down any other little
9:01
to do things that I might need to put
9:03
for that day so cute little list pads
9:07
I also did get this one this a
9:10
handwriting Notepad
9:11
[Applause]
9:13
so this is obviously more geared towards
9:16
the children's section they do have
9:18
children's notebooks and pads
9:24
but this oh I didn't even realize it was
9:26
two different pads but this is really
9:28
nice too for if you want to practice
9:30
your hand lettering and stuff like that
9:32
I figured I would grab this because
9:33
we're always still even though Andrew's
9:35
10 his handwriting is one thing that
9:37
we've been continuing to work on with
9:39
him plus EB has really just learned all
9:42
of her letters but she obviously doesn't
9:43
know how to draw them yet she's only
9:45
three so we are working on that and
9:48
starting to teach her some of the
9:49
drawings and the difference between
9:51
capitals and not you know uncapitalized
9:53
so I think those will come in handy and
9:55
they're super cute
9:57
I also got this so even though I'm like
10:00
I'm going to simplify my planners and
10:02
journals and things I have been wanting
10:05
the journal the travel Journal so this
10:07
is A5 size you can put a different cover
10:09
on here if you want it comes with rose
10:11
gold and this is basically a travel
10:15
Journal so you have flight numbers any
10:18
kind of transportation that you want to
10:20
do lodging reservation numbers and other
10:22
things like that and this is kind of
10:25
like the first little section so you
10:27
could put landmarks in places you want
10:29
to visit things you want to do little
10:31
prep and to-do lists in here and there's
10:33
lots of pages of those trip to Do's
10:35
packing lists this is a really neat
10:38
notebook then you've got a spending
10:39
tracker which is really great for your
10:41
budgeting for your trips I am planning a
10:44
trip to Disney World with my best friend
10:46
for my 46th birthday in January so I'm
10:49
already having my eye on this for that
10:51
trip I'm going to go ahead and start
10:52
using it then of course it's undated for
10:55
the actual trip itself and so you can
10:57
put in the dates that you want to use
11:00
and then in here it has your trip
11:03
itinerary and it has room for two full
11:06
weeks of your trip itinerary I'm only
11:08
going for like four days
11:10
um you have your plan for the day and
11:12
then you can just have journals and
11:14
stuff favorite moments you're joyful
11:16
your memories or mementos so if you had
11:19
like ticket stubs or anything like that
11:20
you could put that in here and then more
11:23
daily planning and things like that so
11:24
you've got kind of your section for your
11:27
trip and then it just continues on with
11:30
those different mementos and stuff like
11:33
that now there might be 14 days worth of
11:36
daily planning here I'm not sure and
11:39
then you also have this little section
11:41
that's like recap and notes so I'm
11:44
thinking this is really kind of set up
11:47
for if you're going on a big like
11:48
European trip or something like that
11:50
because it only has one monthly calendar
11:52
and then it has all these daily pages
11:55
but I figure I can add tabs to this that
11:58
I can section it out so then we could
12:00
use it for for my trip to Disney I could
12:02
use it for any conferences I'm going to
12:04
I could also use it for anything we're
12:07
doing with family like I know we're
12:08
going to go back and visit George's
12:09
family at some point next year and then
12:12
there's a lot of journaling Pages here
12:14
and more memories and things like that
12:16
places to visit again or visit next time
12:19
activities so there's lots of little
12:21
things and of course if any of these
12:22
don't match up with what you want to do
12:24
you can always just cover them with
12:26
stickers and do it however you want so I
12:28
thought that was really nice so I
12:30
grabbed that one
12:33
um I also grabbed this habit tracker and
12:35
this is for the A5 ring agenda I have
12:38
this I believe in the magnet but I don't
12:40
think I have it in the A5 ring agenda
12:43
but I wasn't sure I was like do I have
12:45
this because I feel like I have it in
12:47
the magnet so I'm gonna look before I
12:49
open it and if I already have it then
12:51
I'll use it for giveaway
12:53
this was something else I was really
12:55
happy to see in the store and this like
12:58
kind of rose gold looking leather like
13:01
leatherette it's sort of like vegan
13:03
leather really clearly matches the Hello
13:06
Kitty collection of the desk pad so I
13:08
think I'm going to use this on my desk
13:10
next year even though I'm not currently
13:12
using that desk Pad but this is
13:15
basically just a pretty note pages that
13:18
you can have on your desk and I find
13:21
that especially when I'm like doing
13:23
YouTube videos or I'm trying to remember
13:25
links or I'm having meetings and stuff
13:27
I'm always like Where'd I put that those
13:29
notes you know whatever
13:30
so this would be one way to keep them
13:32
all together and then they are
13:34
perforated as well and then you can
13:36
actually open this up and you can
13:38
replace this notepad so I love that
13:42
super nice and it's very pretty on your
13:45
desk
13:45
another one that I grabbed is this Hello
13:48
Kitty Wellness pad and this is one of
13:50
those things that I've actually been
13:51
kind of avoiding because it is Hello
13:55
Kitty but I'm like am I actually going
13:57
to use it I don't know and I still don't
13:59
100 know if I will use it a lot but it's
14:02
got Wellness notes action steps and more
14:05
habit tracking but when I saw it in
14:07
person I was just like okay I have to
14:08
have this and maybe it's something that
14:10
I will pull out and actually punch to
14:13
put in my planner rather than leaving it
14:15
as a desk Pad but this is so cute I
14:18
really love it
14:21
so another benefit to going in the store
14:23
is they had so many of the focused
14:26
collection items that I normally haven't
14:29
seen as many people reviewing the
14:32
focused stuff in the past and so I
14:35
thought let me check out some of the
14:37
focus collection they have these
14:39
softbound notebooks that are very
14:41
similar to just the regular Erin Condren
14:43
collection but they had this one that's
14:45
called productivity notebook it only
14:48
came in Black inside the store but I'm
14:50
not sure on the website but it has this
14:51
pretty pinstripe design and then the
14:54
entire notebook is this only open to a
14:57
better page
14:58
is this section here so you've got three
15:01
lined sections a checklist section and
15:05
then a blank box and then you have dot
15:06
grid over here and then it just repeats
15:09
that over and over and over again and I
15:11
was thinking okay this I can already
15:13
imagine like a hundred different ways
15:15
that I could use this and it has two
15:17
different ribbons so you could have
15:20
multiple projects going on at once and I
15:23
think that this will be super useful so
15:26
this is just a productivity notebook
15:29
okay second bag I did get I got actually
15:33
two sets of sticky note pads but I had
15:36
already opened and started using one of
15:37
them and now I can't find where it is in
15:39
my bag so I will find it for you guys
15:41
and I will share it this is more of
15:43
their eco-friendly like focused
15:44
collection stuff but I really like these
15:47
types of things so it's got multiple
15:49
different designs here and then it has
15:52
the little half moons and I feel like I
15:54
will use that a lot so it's another
15:56
thing that will look pretty on my desk
15:58
but also be useful and then like I said
16:01
they had some of these like wonton in a
16:03
million type things so so then I've got
16:06
this pretty charm and I know I'm going
16:08
to use these immediately this will go on
16:10
my Delfonics pouch and then this one is
16:12
going to go on my planner or my
16:14
Travelers notebook so super cute and
16:16
there are more things from wonton in a
16:18
Million
16:20
foreign
16:23
ER so they wouldn't get damaged
16:26
yes so we also have this planner sheet
16:30
which has the kind of Erin Condren Jade
16:33
functional ones then I also got this one
16:36
paper Panda was another one that had a
16:39
few items in the shop so that's some
16:41
to-do lists and then more just wonton
16:44
and a million stickers hopefully you can
16:46
see that through the lighting here but
16:48
really cute little like little Polaroids
16:51
and little planners here like with the
16:54
coil I just thought that was so cute
16:56
and then also this one I got two of each
16:59
of these I think oh no this this one has
17:02
two different colors so very cute
17:04
another thing that I got were these
17:07
binder clips and they have different
17:10
sayings on them
17:13
so to pull them out you've got three of
17:15
the Erin Condren asterisks and then
17:17
you've got today to do and ta-da which I
17:20
thought were cute I love the colors on
17:22
that
17:23
and then we get into the kind of the
17:26
final three items that uh were kind of
17:30
the more pricier items so I didn't
17:32
intend necessarily to go into the store
17:34
and get a new A5 binder but I fell in
17:36
love with this one so this is kind of a
17:39
Dusty pink it's still really neutral
17:41
color and it has some little Focus dots
17:43
and other embossing on the cover itself
17:47
and then it's that same envelope closure
17:50
and the nice pink Dusty interior with
17:53
gold rings and I just thought this was
17:55
gorgeous and so I needed to bring it
17:57
home with me but I I came so close to
17:59
buying the gray one too that had the
18:01
kind of more like Arch design I thought
18:04
that was really nice too so if I go back
18:06
someday I'm gonna get the other one but
18:08
I just really liked this and I do like
18:10
most of my binders are Kiki K and
18:14
they're harder right but the Erin
18:17
Condren ones are really flip-floppy and
18:19
I do like that because you can really
18:21
fill them up a lot so I'm excited to use
18:24
this one in the new year then I kind of
18:27
opened this up for you guys when I was
18:29
in the store in that Vlog and by the way
18:31
if you are watching this and you did not
18:33
get to see my actual like traipsing
18:36
through the Erin Condren store that is
18:37
on day 20 of nanowrimo so I will link
18:40
that video for you down below it was so
18:43
much fun but they sell this year they've
18:46
got these gift sets so this is part of
18:48
their like Christmas or holiday gift
18:51
sets and I feel like I'm just even gonna
18:53
keep this like just the packaging is
18:56
adorable so Erin Condren Tori sent me
19:01
the purple one that you guys have seen
19:03
before but that was just the regular
19:06
desktop like productivity set or
19:09
whatever but I did not have the Hello
19:11
Kitty set so basically the way this
19:14
works is when you get it it's a box that
19:19
has a few items in it so you have this
19:22
Hello Kitty notebook which I didn't get
19:24
a chance to see I'm guessing it's just
19:26
lined pages ooh it's a productivity type
19:30
checklist okay can you see that so it's
19:31
lined on one side and then it's uh dot
19:34
like Circle checklist on the other which
19:36
is even more useful and the most
19:39
adorable design
19:40
so cute then you also have some Hello
19:43
Kitty
19:44
uh
19:45
sticky notes and a Hello Kitty list pad
19:48
and then I think that's everything
19:51
inside here and then you also get a
19:53
couple of their pins which I think these
19:56
are ballpoint pens but they are super
19:58
cute because they have little Hello
20:00
Kitties on them I don't know how well
20:01
that'll show up let me see if I can
20:02
unwrap it
20:07
so I don't know if this will show up on
20:09
camera but it says keep going and it has
20:12
like rainbows and similar to the Hello
20:15
Kitty box design and this one also says
20:18
keep going so very cute little pens and
20:21
yes they are ballpoint which is not
20:23
usually my favorite but because they're
20:25
so cute I will use them but basically
20:28
you can set this up now I
20:32
okay
20:33
the the most like sort of annoying part
20:35
of it is like what do you do with this
20:37
flap so what I was doing when I set it
20:39
up is I was putting the notepad back in
20:42
so the flap would lay down
20:44
and then
20:45
um you know putting these things back in
20:47
and it kind of lays flat but you can
20:49
open this up and it becomes kind of like
20:51
a desk organizer that you can put your
20:54
pins in your sticky notes and other
20:55
things and then it can go up against the
20:58
wall or up on your desk and it's really
21:00
really super cute and then you can close
21:02
it up but in order to close it up you
21:04
have to pull this flap back out
21:07
and then you can close it and it becomes
21:09
just a little like a little cabinet that
21:11
you can open that has your goodies in it
21:13
and I really like the pin cup and stuff
21:15
like that so very cute they have this in
21:18
Hello Kitty they have it just in the
21:20
their basic like design that I think has
21:22
some Flora stuff and then they also have
21:24
it in a Star Wars design so very cute
21:26
little gift if you want to something to
21:30
gift to people oh there's more I thought
21:33
those were the last three things no
21:35
there's more stuff so let me pull this
21:37
out so we've got the budget at a glance
21:40
so this is basically budget inserts for
21:43
the A5 and you guys will see in my 2023
21:46
planner lineup coming up soon that I'm
21:48
going to be trying to simplify the
21:51
number of planners I'm using and instead
21:53
really lean heavily on inserts in my A5
21:56
so you basically have the budget at a
21:58
glance per month and then you have
22:00
spending pages over here to track your
22:02
spending so I'm looking forward to using
22:05
that then they also had a budget sticker
22:08
book
22:10
and this is also something that I know
22:13
I'm going to use a lot so it's got
22:16
a variety of foiling so you've got gold
22:19
foil rose gold and they're platinum or
22:22
silver or foiling and so there's like
22:25
spending challenges in here Bill do type
22:28
stickers and things like that in here to
22:31
use
22:32
then I also just grabbed a couple of
22:34
different monthly functional tab ones
22:37
that I could put in my other planner so
22:40
those are monthly tabs and then the
22:43
final thing I said I wasn't going to get
22:44
a planner but first of all how cute is
22:46
this cover I love it it's a little Hello
22:48
Kitty snow globe one
22:50
but this is where I fell in love with
22:53
the focus collection that I've used the
22:56
teacher planner in the past but usually
22:58
I use it in the big size and I'm trying
23:01
to kind of get away from the eight and a
23:02
half by 11 type sizes that are harder to
23:04
carry around for this next year but
23:07
previously the teacher planner did not
23:10
come in the seven by nine but at least
23:13
in the focus collection it does and they
23:16
did not have any in store that were the
23:18
January start ones but they did have
23:21
some starting in August and then it was
23:22
discounted so just to show you the
23:25
layout of this one and I'm going to be
23:28
Franken planning this anyway so I didn't
23:30
mind that I had old Pages plus I I don't
23:32
mind re-dating planners so you've got a
23:35
very minimal layout for the monthly and
23:39
then their weekly pages are sectioned
23:42
off like this and I'm gonna be you'll
23:44
see in my 2023 planner lineup I'm going
23:46
to be leaning heavily on my A5 with
23:48
inserts as well as
23:50
and Erin Condren frankenplan with
23:53
multiple different planners in it so I
23:54
will show you guys that whole process
23:56
and how I'm going to go through it but
23:58
this is going to become my social media
24:00
planner for next year and I'm excited to
24:02
show you how I'm going to use it so this
24:04
is the teacher planner in the 7x9 size I
24:07
am very very excited for this one and I
24:09
just got it with the Platinum coil
24:11
and this one goes through next August so
24:14
that is my Erin Condren haul you guys I
24:17
will have everything linked for you down
24:18
below okay that's it for our Erin
24:21
Condren haul I hope you loved it it was
24:23
such an honor to go into the store and
24:26
to get to film everything and just hang
24:28
out but today is all about family and
24:31
family can be a complex thing it is
24:34
certainly a complex thing in my life
24:36
because I don't speak to the majority of
24:38
my family and of course when you grow up
24:40
with those Traditions that are you know
24:43
this is what we do every year and then
24:46
you by choice take yourself and remove
24:48
yourself from those Traditions even
24:50
though the Traditions were toxic and
24:53
abusive at times it's still sometimes
24:55
it's hard to try to develop your own
24:57
routines or to you know create your own
25:01
Traditions with your smaller group and
25:03
so it's always a complicated day for me
25:05
because there are times that I miss that
25:08
bigger group I miss some of those people
25:10
of course I loved them but loving them
25:12
doesn't always mean allowing them to be
25:14
abusive towards you and so if this is a
25:17
complex holiday for you to for any
25:19
Myriad of reasons I want you to know
25:21
that I love you that you belong here
25:24
with us no abuse here just love and good
25:28
intentions and I am so glad that you're
25:30
part of this community so thank you for
25:32
being here Thanksgiving for me is less
25:35
about the old traditions and more now
25:37
about my family and about being grateful
25:40
for what I have overcome grateful for
25:44
what I've been given grateful for the
25:46
blessings in my life and for the lessons
25:47
and when I count my blessings I count
25:50
you as part of that so thank you for
25:52
being part of this community I love you
25:55
I hope you enjoyed this little Erin
25:57
Condren haul today and I will see you
25:59
guys tomorrow for my official
26:00
Thanksgiving Vlog one week left let's do
26:04
this oh by the way I did actually sit
26:06
down and write 2 000 words last night
26:09
sat down for a while at like eight
26:11
o'clock talk 8 30 and wrote until about
26:14
10 and got 2 000 words so I'll put that
26:16
word count up here and then we'll
26:18
continue on tomorrow all right I love
26:20
you all goodbye
26:23
[Music]
26:42
[Music]
26:59
thank you
27:03
[Music]

and I'm sitting here thinking I could
0:02
probably go at least another hour so I'm
0:04
gonna blow past that 13k I hope and
0:07
we'll see where I end up
0:11
[Music]
0:17
[Music]
0:26
thank you
0:36
[Music]
0:44
[Music]
0:45
thank you
0:48
[Music]
0:49
okay so it has been quite an afternoon I
0:53
had such a hard time sort of settling
0:55
and focusing but I did get just over 2
0:57
000 words
0:58
so I'm at seven thousand something for
1:02
this Retreat so getting close to 8 000
1:05
words I would really like to hit at
1:07
least 13 if not 15 15 feels a little bit
1:11
of a stretch at this point because I
1:13
really just had a hard time focusing and
1:15
then I forgot that I had a business
1:16
meeting today at three so
1:19
yeah I've gotten some other work done
1:20
some schedule type work email work but
1:24
the writing was a little bit slower than
1:25
I hoped but now it is 5 p.m and I am
1:28
going to Houndstooth Coffee which is
1:31
really just down the street from the
1:32
Erin Condren store to meet up with some
1:35
hearties this is so cool to be in a new
1:39
city and have some people that follow my
1:41
YouTube channel that are gonna come meet
1:42
up with me for coffee so this should be
1:44
fun
1:45
[Music]
1:55
thank you foreign
1:59
[Music]
2:32
foreign
2:38
[Music]
2:51
[Music]
2:53
our Meetup with the fellow hearties that
2:55
was so much fun I definitely stayed
2:57
later than I originally intended but it
2:59
was worth it it was so good to meet
3:01
everybody and have a nice dinner and
3:04
just sit and chat with fellow authors it
3:06
was a good time for sure and then I was
3:09
able to find a Starbucks that is still
3:10
open so I got an extra shot of espresso
3:14
and my coffee and I double checked that
3:17
noon is the checkout tomorrow so I can
3:20
pretty much stay up late and still get
3:22
seven hours of sleep as long as I don't
3:25
stay up past a certain time so I'm gonna
3:28
grab my headphones and I'm going to get
3:33
started writing for the night Lisa is
3:35
currently sprinting in our
3:36
heartbreakings running Community which
3:37
the link if you want to join our Sprints
3:39
here on YouTube is down in the
3:42
description box below
3:45
this is fun
3:47
I have really had a good time I have
3:49
written at this point 7 700 words
3:52
originally I was hoping for 13
3:55
000 and then 15 000 was kind of my goal
3:59
once I did my time but I also know that
4:02
I made different choices and so I'm
4:06
probably not going to hit that 15K
4:07
unless I just hit a massive set of
4:10
thousand word Sprints so I'm gonna just
4:13
write until I have as much as I can and
4:16
I'm gonna feel proud of that and yeah
4:19
I'm ready to go so
4:22
need like just I did already change into
4:24
my PJs but I feel like I need just a
4:26
minute to like kind of calm my brain
4:28
down and then I will jump back into some
4:32
writing Sprints I'm feeling good about
4:33
the story so that's the most important
4:36
thing so I'm going to get as far as I
4:37
can tonight let's do this
4:41

[Music]
5:32
foreign
5:37
[Music]
5:42
okay it is now midnight but I have also
5:46
officially caught up with
5:49
nanowrimo par and I'm actually very
5:51
close to tomorrow's par which feels
5:55
really good so I am ahead almost a full
5:59
day which is awesome and I'm at 11 240
6:03
words for this writing Retreat so yeah I
6:08
need like when I was figuring out my
6:10
plan for the month I had hoped to get at
6:13
least 13
6:14
000 on this retreat
6:16
in order to stay kind of in winning in
6:21
in the chance of winning so I still need
6:23
at least 2 000 words luckily I do have
6:26
some people sprinting with me in my
6:28
Discord server so I have my friends
6:31
hanging out on Discord on my iPad and
6:34
then I've got my Chromebook here and
6:37
then I'm using my phone for
6:40
um tracking my word count and it's going
6:43
well
6:44
it's good to have other people to Sprint
6:46
with even though our sprinting bot is
6:48
acting up but I'm going to keep going
6:50
I'm going to get to at least thirteen
6:51
thousand it would be awesome if I could
6:53
hit 15 000 but I that might be asking
6:56
too much to get another 4 000 or 3 800
6:58
words tonight but I have had a couple of
7:01
Sprints so we're over a thousand words
7:02
each when the words are really flowing
7:04
so it's possible I'm gonna keep trying
7:07
for it so let's keep going
7:11
foreign
7:16
[Music]
7:22
[Music]
7:35
so it has been a very successful hour
7:39
I have done 17 total Sprints during this
7:42
writing Retreat and I have gotten 12 800
7:46
or so words so my kind of like good goal
7:50
was 13k 15 was kind of like better and
7:53
then 18 000 was my best
7:56
and I'm sitting here thinking I could
7:58
probably go at least another hour so I'm
8:00
gonna blow past that 13k I hope and
8:03
we'll see where I end up
8:05
[Music]
8:21
it's 1 30 and I have crossed the 13 000
8:25
word mark for
8:28
The Retreat and I'm at 38 485 for Nano
8:33
and I'm sitting here I can't even
8:35
remember what my 40K reward is but I'm
8:39
so close now I'm like one or two sprints
8:41
and I know I'll have it so
8:44
um my 30k reward is daily Starbucks for
8:48
the rest of Nano so that may not be
8:51
practical just because I have to
8:53
actually drive
8:55
15 minutes to get to Starbucks but it's
8:58
an option that I can have okay just
9:01
looked in my planner to see what my 40K
9:03
reward is and it's a Black Friday budget
9:06
bonus so there's a few things that I
9:09
want to purchase for Black Friday stuff
9:12
like shopping this week and so George
9:16
and I had talked about if I got to 40K
9:19
before Black Friday which if I get it
9:22
tonight I'm definitely there then I get
9:24
to basically add 50
9:27
to my current budget and there's some
9:30
things that I've been waiting to get for
9:32
the house you know it's hard when you
9:33
move into a brand new house because
9:34
especially because we had been on the
9:36
road and we got rid of so much stuff
9:38
that it's kind of hard to afford to
9:43
refurnish and you know get everything
9:45
exactly the way that you want if you're
9:47
buying everything all at once so we've
9:49
been kind of doing room by room and sort
9:51
of taking our time with it but there's a
9:53
few things I've been waiting for deals
9:54
to come out so I am
9:57
I'm excited to get that so if I can get
10:00
it tonight then all I need is 10K left
10:03
for the rest of Nano and we still have a
10:05
week to go so I'm feeling pretty good
10:08
about that and it makes me feel like
10:10
there's no way I'm gonna lose this year
10:13
and all it took was just one like two
10:17
really good focused days and the thing
10:20
that's made all the difference is having
10:22
those note cards and having taken the
10:24
time to figure out that timeline and see
10:26
I was
10:27
scared to take out the time from my
10:30
writing to work on the outline but it
10:32
ended up paying off for me this time
10:34
doesn't always but it did this time and
10:37
I'm feeling really encouraged so even
10:39
though it's
10:40
130 Plus in the morning I'm probably
10:43
gonna stay up for a little bit longer
10:45
and hit that 40K so let's do this
10:48
[Music]
11:04
foreign
11:06
[Music]
11:14
oh my gosh I did it so I originally got
11:19
to 40
11:20
000 041 and then realized that that got
11:22
me only 16 words away from 15K so I went
11:26
ahead and wrote another sentence or so
11:28
ended up with 15 015 words
11:31
for the retreat so now I sleep and head
11:37
home tomorrow
11:39
hey good morning everybody so it's 9 30
11:41
and I had hoped to not get up until 10
11:44
today because I needed the sleep but I
11:47
actually woke up at seven uh just out of
11:50
habit I guess so I did not get as much
11:52
sleep as I wanted so I have probably
11:55
gonna grab a nice big coffee as I'm
11:57
heading out but it feels so good to look
12:00
at this chart and see 40
12:03
000 words because
12:06
that means I won my two next two rewards
12:10
on this Retreat it also means I'm ahead
12:13
on my work I get to do some fun shopping
12:15
for Black Friday for my office space and
12:19
I get to get a Starbucks every day so
12:22
that is really exciting I also had
12:24
forgotten
12:26
um that I brought one of these little
12:28
tokidoki surprise boxes from Hello Kitty
12:30
to open if I hit the fifteen thousand
12:34
and I did so I'm gonna open that real
12:36
quick
12:41
foreign
12:55
it's a little My Melody I do not have
12:58
this one I have the batsmaru one and the
13:01
Hello Kitty one but I do not have this
13:04
one it's so cute with the little
13:05
strawberries oh my gosh oh the unicorn
13:08
has the little bunny ears
13:10
okay that is adorable I love it yay for

I know it's nothing new but it's so good
0:40
to see you
0:44
[Music]
0:47
we do this every day and I'm still so
0:51
amazed
0:53
by you
0:57
so hold me tight

through the night

2:02
I'm here so it was a bit of a rainy
2:04
drive but it was fine it was quick and
2:09
I'm here later if you watched the
2:12
previous Vlog where I was talking about
2:13
my plans for the trip I'm here much
2:16
later than I originally intended because
2:17
I spent a little bit of extra time with
2:18
the kids and I think I just didn't
2:20
calculate correctly what time I would be
2:23
heading out so it's 5 30.
2:26
so I am going to go ahead and eat and
2:31
everything else and not even worry about
2:32
writing until about seven and then we'll
2:34
see how far I can get it's very unlikely
2:36
I'm gonna get 11 Sprints in today
2:38
because I'm getting here later than I
2:41
expected and I gotta figure out where
2:42
there's food and stuff like that so
2:44
that's okay that's kind of the way every
2:47
writing Retreat goes is like there's
2:49
traffic or you end up later than you
2:51
thought or you know whatever and it may
2:53
not be perfect it may not work out
2:55
exactly the way you want it but just be
2:57
as flexible as you can so this is the
3:01
Lone Star Court in Austin super super
3:04
cute it's right in the middle of the
3:05
domain and I wish it wasn't rainy
3:09
because I would love to enjoy the actual
3:11
like Courtyard area later tonight but
3:13
we'll hope that maybe tomorrow will not
3:15
be rainy either way I'm looking forward
3:17
to writing on this couch or this really
3:21
nice desk here it has a nice cozy vibe
3:25
to it so I'm hoping it's going to be a
3:27
successful writing Retreat so I'm gonna
3:30
go find food and then set up all my
3:32
stuff and get to writing okay so I am
3:35
waiting for my food to arrive and I have
3:38
sort of unpacked and gotten everything
3:40
ready to go and as per usual I have
3:43
forgotten some things that I wanted but
3:45
I have most everything just a little bit
3:47
of a tour this is my desk area and I
3:51
just want to show you what all I have
3:53
brought so I brought my little Doterra
3:56
travel diffuser and I brought a few
3:59
different scents so I brought joy and
4:02
celebrate from revive essential oils and
4:05
I also brought motivate from Doterra and
4:07
then I brought sleep for later this
4:10
thing is so great because it puts out a
4:12
good amount of scent if you like
4:14
essential oils for a small space so that
4:18
is nice
4:19
and I can move it around the room I have
4:22
some of my colorful pins I have my phone
4:24
I have my chart paper that has some of
4:27
my plot stuff on it I always love to
4:30
bring
4:31
some of my crystals and some little
4:33
Hello Kitties just for motivation and
4:36
feeling good I also brought my little I
4:39
think this is called a Zoe but this is
4:41
one of those d-boom you've seen these
4:43
maybe around before but it's just a
4:46
little speaker and it will show little
4:49
pixelated scenes on there to write on
4:53
I have brought my Samsung Chromebook
4:55
plus this is older it's like five five
5:00
years old I think but I have written so
5:02
many books on this little Chromebook and
5:05
I usually have a skin on it but I had to
5:07
take it off because it has like I
5:09
wouldn't be able to film it because it
5:10
had spoilers for covers but I also have
5:13
a clear quartz and some more little
5:15
Hello Kitty things
5:16
this little mason jar was in the
5:18
bathroom so I grabbed it for some of my
5:20
pins I have my note cards here and my
5:23
plotting notebook with of course some
5:25
washi tape and my Delfonics pouch here
5:28
has all my DOT markers and other things
5:31
just in case I need them so this will be
5:33
writing Central for as long as I can
5:36
keep it up I also did bring my iPad just
5:40
in case because I haven't used that
5:43
Samsung Chromebook in maybe a year and a
5:46
half so I thought okay let's bring a
5:48
backup writing just in case I also
5:51
brought my super cute clear bag from
5:54
Erin Condren and so I wanted to bring
5:57
that to the store I have my tarot cards
5:59
I have my six months for life journal I
6:02
also brought something like I was
6:04
telling you in my previous video for
6:06
tracking my word count now it is kind of
6:09
dark in this room and I don't have any
6:10
better lighting but I also forgot so
6:14
this is not a flip chart marker this is
6:17
actually like a whiteboard sheet so it's
6:21
kind of like white board
6:24
on the go so it's just a sheet it clings
6:27
to pretty much any wall and it doesn't
6:30
damage the wall but I meant to bring
6:33
white board markers and I forgot them so
6:35
I'm just using a more permanent marker
6:37
and I tested it and it does come off it
6:39
is a little bit wrinkled because it was
6:42
in my bag but I've Got The Disappearance
6:45
of Vanessa Shaw here I've got Sunday 11
6:47
20 and I will keep my word count for
6:49
Sunday here and then move along to my
6:51
word count for Saturday here and just
6:53
for me having a place to get up after
6:55
every Sprint get moving get out of the
6:57
chair
6:58
so that I don't end up sitting there for
7:00
hours and to have a visual
7:02
representation of what I'm writing is
7:04
super helpful so my food should be here
7:06
any minute so I'm gonna
7:09
kind of get finished getting everything
7:10
set up eat some dinner and then we're
7:13
gonna be writing
7:17
[Music]
7:30
foreign
7:32
[Music]
7:40
is in the books and it's positive so I
7:45
wrote 921 words in that first 25 minutes
7:48
and this for me is the power of having
7:51
the note cards and already having taken
7:53
the time to sort of visualize what that
7:55
scene is going to be because I can
7:57
actually type really fast and when I can
8:00
see and visualize a scene I can write it
8:02
really fast but I get so caught up in
8:05
the plotting but I'm feeling pretty
8:06
hopeful because even though I started
8:08
late if I can write 900 words per Sprint
8:10
I'm going to catch up with less spreads
8:12
overall so let's see how far I can go
8:16
foreign
8:18
[Music]
8:34
okay it is midnight I have done six
8:37
Sprints and I have written just shy of 5
8:41
000 words so I'm going to take my makeup
8:44
off climb into bed do my tarot stuff and
8:48
then I'm going to try to do one more
8:50
Sprint so that I can get over the 30 000
8:53
word Mark which my reward for 30k is
8:57
daily Starbucks so uh that is the next
9:02
um you know for the rest of Nano I will
9:04
get to have a Starbucks every day which
9:05
is very luxurious and exciting I'm going
9:08
to the Erin Condren store tomorrow about
9:10
when they open at 10 A.M and then I'm
9:13
meeting up with some Hardies for coffee
9:14
and potentially dinner tomorrow
9:16
afternoon slash evening so that's going
9:18
to be super fun so I want to make sure
9:20
that I get my rest in tonight and don't
9:22
push it but I'm very happy with nearly 5
9:26
000 words and only six Sprints Which is
9:28
far above my average and so that's
9:30
really great so if I can hit that 5K
9:32
tonight then we go for 10K tomorrow and
9:36
see if I can do it in between all the
9:38
other things that are going on but
9:39
pretty excited and happy with this
9:41
progress so
9:43
into bed I go
9:46
[Music]
9:59
[Music]
10:08
thank you
10:19
good morning everybody so it is Monday
10:23
and it is close to 10 o'clock in the
10:26
morning I am so excited to go to the
10:29
Erin Condren store today this morning
10:31
I'm going I cannot wait to get there I
10:33
can't wait to see everything just the
10:35
building with the mid-century circles on
10:38
the design like on the side of the
10:40
building
10:41
it's just cool and I'm excited to go in
10:43
there and do some shopping even though
10:45
I'm like what do I need because I have
10:47
almost everything that I have wanted but
10:50
there's always more there's always more
10:51
and I'm excited to go in so 5400 words
10:56
last night got a really good night's
10:58
sleep this bed is super super
10:59
comfortable
11:00
however I woke up with
11:03
really upset stomach anxiety and I don't
11:07
really know where it's coming from just
11:09
PTSD I don't know there's things and I'm
11:14
just trying to you know I have I've been
11:17
like using my support system I've got my
11:19
Essential Oils my crystals meditation
11:21
turned on my favorite like dance music
11:24
playlist got my hair done got into
11:26
action and I feel much better so I am
11:30
excited I have sort of cleansed myself
11:32
of that awful anxiety I hate waking up
11:36
like that it's always worse in the
11:37
mornings
11:38
so I feel better deep breaths
11:42
no coffee this morning just in case and
11:46
just hopefully gonna be an amazing day
11:48
this evening slash afternoon I'm meeting
11:51
up with some hearties from here in the
11:53
Austin area which is super cool to just
11:55
randomly be able to connect with people
11:57
so I gotta figure out where my writing's
11:59
coming in in the middle of that I took a
12:02
little bit of time this morning just to
12:03
look through and say okay I'm gonna try
12:05
to go to the store at 10 and do a little
12:08
bit of shopping around and get some
12:09
lunch and then I'm gonna write from 12
12:11
to 3 and then take a break get back to
12:13
writing and then head out to coffee with
12:16
these ladies around five and I don't
12:19
really know how long we'll be there but
12:20
if we end up going to dinner or
12:22
something else then I'm just guessing I
12:24
won't get back until midnight or at
12:26
midnight 8 P.M
12:28
and then I'm going to write until 1am
12:30
and then get some sleep so I can drive
12:32
home safely tomorrow so I'm hoping for
12:34
15 Sprints today and I'm hoping that'll
12:36
get me to 10K so I can hit that 15K for
12:39
the retreat and that will put me above
12:41
where I need to be and in a really good
12:43
spot to win Nano so sometimes all it
12:46
takes is a really good day but it is
12:48
like usually if I'm on a writing Retreat
12:50
I don't have all these other things to
12:52
do like heading out to a store and
12:54
meeting other people it's like usually
12:55
I'm more focused on just the writing but
12:58
the note cards I have made it through
13:00
multiple of them and they have been
13:02
really helping so I'm just gonna do my
13:04
best and let's go see the easy store
13:09

oh my gosh okay I am just like smiling
17:26
from cheek to cheek I wanted to be like
17:28
I'm never leaving the store I live here
17:31
now
17:33
it was amazing it was so much fun they
17:35
were so nice Angelica was amazing like
17:39
kind of walking me around the store
17:40
taking extra photos so good
17:43
um I bought a lot of stuff
17:46
and I was thinking this Vlog is already
17:50
going to be kind of long so what I'm
17:52
going to do is today we have the store
17:54
the rest of the writing I'm meeting up
17:56
with some fellow Hardies at 5 30 at the
18:00
Houndstooth Coffee shop kind of near the
18:02
Erin Condren store over there so I will
18:05
kind of split this into two Vlogs and
18:07
we'll do a haul tomorrow when I get home
18:09
of all the goodies that I bought because
18:11
it's gonna take me some time to get
18:13
through them I just picked up a burger
18:14
from Shake Shack I'm going to eat and
18:18
watch a YouTube video and then I'm gonna
18:19
start writing again I'm afraid it's
18:21
going to be kind of hard to write
18:22
because I'm just like
18:26
I don't know I'm just in a happy like
18:28
mode I need to calm myself down but that
18:31
was so fun
18:41

hey everybody so we are on day 19. we

are coming down to the last you know
0:06
week and a half 10 days or so of
0:08
nanowrimo I'm close to 25 000 words so I
0:12
am just now about hitting halfway five
0:15
days late so we've got some catching up
0:17
to do let's do this

I am getting prepped for hotel night so
1:23
some of you have asked about this like
1:25
what do you do to prep for a hotel night
1:27
what do you take with you so I'm going
1:28
to be sharing The Full Experience I'm
1:30
going to have two nights at a hotel but
1:33
when you have two nights you do have to
1:35
think about the final night driving home
1:37
if you've gone off to a retreat so I
1:40
when we lived on the coast on the East
1:42
Coast I used to
1:44
that sounds so weird because I've lived
1:46
like near the East Coast my whole life
1:48
so it's strange to not be there anymore
1:50
but we are coming up on actually a year
1:53
in Texas starting in just a few days we
1:56
will have been actually maybe today
2:00
was the day we came to Texas last year
2:02
so we have been in Texas for a year we
2:04
started out in Houston then we went to
2:06
Grapevine then we went to Richardson and
2:09
now we're in South Dallas so interesting
2:11
this is my like Texas aversary and it
2:15
feels good like we love being here
2:17
we love this house so we have found our
2:20
place but anyway when I lived on the
2:22
East Coast I used to go to like Myrtle
2:25
Beach or Hilton Head places like that
2:27
and I would get airbnbs which sometimes
2:29
are cheaper than hotels and then
2:32
sometimes if I just needed a single
2:34
night away what I would do is go to
2:36
Priceline express deals this is a hack
2:38
that I used in the very beginning when
2:40
my son was little and I couldn't get
2:42
away for like multiple nights at a time
2:44
I could really only have one night away
2:46
I would look for a Priceline express
2:48
deal in Raleigh area which is where we
2:51
lived at the time near the airport
2:53
because airport hotels tend to be big
2:55
they tend to have lower prices sometimes
2:58
during the weeknights or even the
3:00
weekends sometimes like what I would
3:02
find is often on Sunday nights the
3:05
Marriott near the airport would do a
3:07
Priceline express deal now when you do
3:09
express deals you don't know exactly
3:11
what the hotel is you're just guessing
3:14
but they'll give you like a star rating
3:15
they'll give you a review they'll tell
3:17
you what amenity these the hotel has and
3:19
sometimes if you look in the area where
3:21
the hotel is you can kind of tell or
3:23
guess which one or two it is to see if
3:25
you want to book that deal
3:26
and so I would do that and I would
3:29
always get that Marriott and I loved it
3:31
because I could get a balcony I could
3:33
show up early they had a restaurant and
3:34
it was great and sometimes I would get
3:36
it for like 65 dollars a night so
3:38
definitely check out your local hotels
3:41
and see if you can find a decent hotel
3:43
for you know 60 70 bucks a night and see
3:46
how that works now of course that was 10
3:47
years ago so these days it's more like
3:49
75 to 100 or like downtown Dallas I was
3:53
able to get I think it was a Hilton now
3:55
I can't remember which one I stayed at
3:56
but that was like a hundred dollars for
3:59
the night so half the price of what
4:01
their normal like rack rate is I'm gonna
4:04
be staying at a really cute hotel in
4:05
Austin I will leave tomorrow after Indie
4:07
riderfest is over and I get this Vlog up
4:10
so if you're watching this I'm probably
4:11
already on the road to Austin and what I
4:15
usually tend to do is I want to pack up
4:17
clothes that are comfortable to write in
4:19
stuff that's going to be warm or stuff
4:22
that like layers so that if it ends up
4:24
being hot and I don't want to turn on
4:25
the air conditioning or offend up
4:27
getting really cold in the room I can
4:28
throw on some socks or whatever else but
4:30
the main prep that I do is besides
4:33
making sure that I have whatever
4:35
computer I most want to write on is
4:37
making sure that I have note cards or
4:39
scene cards for what I'm planning to
4:40
write when I'm there in my experience if
4:43
I show up to a hotel night like I'm not
4:45
a panther but if you are just show up
4:47
and pants the crap out of it but I am
4:49
not typically a pantser so what I like
4:50
to do is I like to think about how much
4:53
time do I have how many writing Sprints
4:55
do I think I'm going to get in and then
4:57
how many scenes do I think I'll be able
4:59
to write in that amount of time so then
5:01
I prep by planning what scenes I'm gonna
5:03
write so I'm going to take you guys
5:04
through that process today we're going
5:06
to get some writing done I'm gonna set
5:09
the family up because somehow it seems
5:11
like the family has a hard time
5:12
surviving without mama and so I will
5:15
make sure to get them groceries and
5:16
everything else we also share a car so
5:18
George won't be able to take the kids
5:20
out to get groceries and stuff like that
5:22
so I will need to make sure they are
5:24
settled and good to go for the next few
5:25
days luckily Andrew's out of school so
5:28
they'll just be hanging out at home
5:29
until I get home
5:30
so I'm going to take you through the
5:32
process of figuring out how much I'm
5:34
hoping to write setting my goals for the
5:36
weekend and packing up my clothes so I
5:39
already have some stuff here now this
5:40
trip is going to be a little bit
5:41
different than normal because I'm hoping
5:44
to go to the Erin Condren store and I
5:46
want to take pictures and film it and I
5:47
want to look cute but normally I
5:48
wouldn't worry about looking cute I
5:50
would just worry about looking
5:51
comfortable or being comfortable but I
5:54
also am going to be editing Vlogs while
5:56
I'm there so I can get the Vlogs up to
5:57
you guys so I need to think about what
5:59
computer equipment what camera what SD
6:02
card and so there's a little bit extra
6:04
than what would go into like a normal
6:06
Hotel night but I'm excited to bring you
6:09
along and we'll prep together today and
6:11
then go right tomorrow
6:13
okay you guys so this is how I create a
6:18
plan for a writing Retreat or when I
6:20
know I'm going to be like trying to
6:22
binge write for a little while now I
6:24
just sat down and recorded this whole
6:26
process so this is why this is already
6:27
done but it was a 20 minute video and I
6:29
was like okay let's not have a 35 minute
6:32
Vlog today so I'm gonna just tell you
6:35
what I did when I know I'm going away
6:37
either for a night or longer there's
6:40
really two ways that you can create your
6:43
schedule but I highly recommend that you
6:45
go in with a plan Beyond just I'm gonna
6:48
write as much as I feel like unless
6:50
that's okay like if you just want to
6:52
write as much as you feel like writing
6:54
and you just want to have a chill time
6:55
great
6:56
I'm a planner so if you're like me and
6:59
this resonates with you here's just what
7:01
I tend to do so one way is to set a goal
7:05
for yourself
7:06
so what you could do just not looking at
7:09
this is you could say okay my goal for
7:11
the next two days is I want to try to
7:14
write 11 000 words then you say divided
7:18
by
7:19
you can either do it by hour or you can
7:21
do it by writing Sprint I tend to go by
7:23
writing Sprints which for me tend to be
7:25
20 or 25 minutes with a five or ten
7:27
minute break so I do it in 30 minute
7:29
chunks just like I do everything in my
7:31
life 30 minute task blocks so for me in
7:34
a 30 minute writing session that
7:36
includes a break I can typically write
7:38
an average of 650 words per session per
7:42
per Sprint so I would take the 11 000
7:45
words divided by 650 on average and
7:48
that's going to give me a total of how
7:50
many Sprints I need in order to hit that
7:53
word count for the weekend and of course
7:55
I might come under or might go over but
7:57
this gives me at least a Target point so
8:00
for me if I my goal was 11 000 I would
8:02
need to look at my schedule and find
8:04
time for 17 writing sprints
8:08
so that's one way you can do it I like
8:10
to do it the opposite of that because if
8:12
I start with a goal I might be setting
8:14
an unrealistic goal so instead I like to
8:17
start with a schedule so I have taken
8:19
Sunday Monday and Tuesday which is my
8:22
retreat session and I have created a
8:26
schedule for myself and then I've
8:27
figured out from that schedule how many
8:29
writing Sprints I think I'm going to do
8:31
per day so I'm going to check into the
8:33
hotel give myself time to chill out and
8:35
then I'm going to start writing around 5
8:37
PM and I'm going to write for two hours
8:39
which is for 30 minute sessions then I'm
8:42
going to give myself an hour for dinner
8:44
and then I'm going to sit down and write
8:45
another five Sprints and that is going
8:48
to be over the course of three hours
8:49
which technically I could fit six
8:51
Sprints into those three hours but three
8:54
hours is a long time to sit without a
8:55
break so I'll probably take a break and
8:57
get some coffee or something in between
8:59
so five Sprints there then at 11 PM
9:03
because I will have been sitting for so
9:05
long I'm going to take a longer break
9:06
and do like my tarot cards or watch a
9:09
video get up and stretch a little bit
9:11
and then I'm going to write a couple
9:12
more Sprints before I wind down for the
9:14
night so then I look at those writing
9:16
times and I say okay 4 plus 5 plus 2 is
9:19
11 Sprints so I'm my goal is to write 11
9:22
sprints on Sunday then I know that I
9:25
need at least six to seven hours of
9:27
sleep so I'm gonna let myself sleep
9:29
until eight and then I'm gonna write at
9:32
9 30. so that gives me time for
9:33
breakfast shower getting ready for the
9:35
day I'm gonna write for four Sprints and
9:38
then I'm going to potentially go to the
9:41
Erin Condren store have lunch maybe with
9:43
some Hardies I had some people reach out
9:45
and say I'm from Austin so if we get a
9:47
chance we'll meet up
9:49
um if you are from Austin and you want
9:52
to meet up and you want to be part of it
9:53
if we decide to get coffee or lunch
9:55
we'll probably be going to The Domain
9:57
area so if that is you send me an email
10:00
at Sarah heartbreathings.com so that I
10:02
can send you the to meet up information
10:04
if we decide to do it so that may be
10:07
Monday but right now I don't know that
10:09
schedule so I just created a large swath
10:11
of time for it and then if it moves to
10:15
Tuesday or if it becomes dinner instead
10:17
that's fine and I'll just move my
10:18
schedule around
10:20
so this isn't perfect it's just doing
10:22
the best you can so I've given myself
10:23
like five hours or so to four and a half
10:27
hours to do lunch and shopping but my
10:30
goal would be to restart my writing
10:31
around 4 pm and then I'm going to write
10:33
for five Sprints take a dinner break
10:36
restart and write for five more Sprints
10:38
and I wrote a little note to take warm
10:40
clothes because I saw that this hotel
10:42
has like a pool area with fire pits and
10:46
stuff like that so if it's not 30
10:48
degrees maybe I'll go outside and write
10:50
a little bit with my gloves and stuff
10:52
but it might also be too cold so we'll
10:53
see but another break at 11 PM restart
10:57
at midnight but this time go instead of
11:00
until 1am let's try to go till 2 A.M
11:02
again that might shift but then I've
11:04
written out how many writing Sprints I
11:06
think that'll be for each session and it
11:08
comes to a total of 18 Sprints now first
11:13
I just want to say don't compare
11:15
yourself to me because you may not be
11:17
able to write nine full hours in a day
11:19
not everybody he can we're not all built
11:21
the same way it doesn't make me better
11:23
than you it doesn't make me worse than
11:24
you it doesn't make my words crappy and
11:26
it doesn't mean that I'm a you know
11:28
better faster writer you guys know how
11:31
slow I tend to write overall it just
11:34
means this is my number and if your
11:35
number is you can do a Max of two hours
11:37
of writing and then you want to chill
11:40
and enjoy and fill your well the rest of
11:42
the time and read books then that is a
11:44
perfect writing Retreat for you so don't
11:45
judge it it's just for me I'm trying to
11:47
write as much as possible so I'm giving
11:49
myself breaks but I'm also trying to
11:51
write so when I add those two days
11:52
together I get 29 writing Sprints so
11:55
then what I do is I say okay if I hit my
11:58
goal of 29 and I write 650 words on
12:02
average a Sprint that gives me a Max of
12:06
18 850. so this gives me an idea of what
12:11
my Max goal to shoot for is so I don't
12:13
want to go into the weekend thinking oh
12:14
I'm going to write 25 000 words because
12:17
really the max I can hope for is around
12:19
eighteen thousand eight hundred and if I
12:21
get eighteen thousand hundred eight
12:23
hundred I will be shocked because that
12:25
is a huge word count and I don't know
12:27
that I can do that right now I don't
12:28
know that I have the stamina for that so
12:30
I'm gonna actually back it down you guys
12:33
know I always love to build in buffer
12:35
and I'm going to say my goal for the
12:38
retreat is 16 or 15 000 words that's
12:42
what I'm aiming for and having a goal
12:45
for me is super important not so I can
12:48
beat myself up if I don't hit it if I
12:50
only get to 9 000 I'll still be hugely
12:52
excited because that's a huge word count
12:54
compared to how much I've been writing
12:56
all year I'll be super happy with that
12:57
but I like setting a goal so that I can
13:00
have something to aim for it gives me
13:01
motivation and excitement and Clarity
13:04
and I like it
13:06
so I'm shooting for 15K kind of best
13:09
scenario best case scenario would be 18K
13:13
then on Tuesday I'm going to get up and
13:14
head home maybe I'll write a little bit
13:16
when I get home but I know for me if I'm
13:18
gonna write 29 Sprints in two days
13:20
Tuesday might be a zero day for me it
13:23
might just not be a writing day at all
13:25
and that's okay too so
13:27
um then what I like to do is probably
13:30
won't do it in this notebook I'll do it
13:32
in my plotting notebook is I like to
13:34
number out those 29 Sprints and then I'm
13:37
going to keep track of how I do as I go
13:40
this also is a motivation tool for me
13:42
that I can say okay yes I got 850 and
13:45
then I can count the Sprints so that I
13:47
got a clear view of how many more I need
13:50
and as this begins to fill up I start to
13:52
get really excited okay oh I made it to
13:54
number 12. we did it we're doing it
13:56
there's you know there's 11 000 words on
13:58
the table you know it's like it starts
14:00
to really motivate me to see this start
14:03
to fill up and what I do is I write my
14:05
total word count here so if I wrote 850
14:07
the first Sprint then the second one my
14:10
total word count is 12.50 then I
14:12
subtract to get my word count per Sprint
14:15
so this is the total words in my retreat
14:18
and this is the total word so far in
14:22
that one individual Sprint if that makes
14:24
sense so
14:26
that way you know then I'll also have a
14:28
total for the manuscript over here so it
14:30
might be like 26 000 words over here
14:33
uh extra zero and then so I'll count
14:36
these three things sometimes I take a
14:39
flip chart
14:41
sheet that you can stick on the wall
14:43
like what teachers use or people use at
14:44
meetings so that I can actually keep
14:46
track of this these sprints on the wall
14:49
where I can see you guys know I love my
14:51
wall my kanban board all that stuff I
14:53
love to do it and make it visual so if I
14:55
can find one in the mess of my house
14:58
right now I will take one of those with
14:59
me along with some like Sharpie
15:02
um flip chart markers and I will keep
15:04
track of my word count and I will share
15:06
that process with you guys but the next
15:09
thing that I do once I have my plan for
15:11
how many writing Sprints I'm gonna do
15:13
I'm aiming for 29 and I'm aiming for
15:15
about 15 to 18 000 words now what I'm
15:19
going to do is I'm gonna go into my
15:21
plotting room I'm going to take out some
15:23
index cards and I'm going to look at
15:25
where am I in the plot right now
15:28
I'm in act two part one
15:31
and where will I be if I write another
15:34
18
15:36
to 20 000 words so by then I'm gonna be
15:39
into act two part two
15:42
so what needs to happen in this in
15:44
between part for me to have enough
15:47
scenes planned out that I can write 18
15:51
000 words because I don't want to show
15:53
up at this Retreat hoping for 29 Sprints
15:55
and only have enough idea of what
15:57
happens in the story to write five or
15:59
six Sprints I want to have a clear idea
16:02
and if I want to use these Sprints for
16:04
actual writing and not brainstorming
16:06
then I need to brainstorm before I go
16:09
and it's totally okay like I said to
16:13
like plan to do your brainstorming or
16:15
just thinking through story at a writing
16:17
Retreat it's not about cramming as many
16:19
words as you can into a weekend but it's
16:21
just about planning for what your goals
16:23
are and what you want to do I want to
16:25
write as much as I can during this
16:27
particular Sprint Retreat writing
16:29
Retreat so I am going to plan out as
16:32
many scenes as possible and if you want
16:34
to see what I put on my note cards when
16:36
I'm planning my scenes in detail I have
16:39
an entire series about how to write your
16:41
book by by scenes and how to plan scenes
16:44
so I will link my video down below where
16:46
I talk about what I put on my index
16:47
cards for planning out scenes and that's
16:50
exactly what I'm about to do right now
16:51
and I'm going to try to plan for about
16:53
18 000 words now I don't have an average
16:56
words per scene or words per chapter but
17:00
just for planning purposes I am going to
17:04
say that I'm going to write somewhere
17:06
around
17:08
1800 words per scene so I need about 10
17:14
scene cards plotted out in order to hope
17:17
to have any chance of hitting these 15
17:20
to 20 000 words and that is how I plan
17:23
my retreat this is the writing portion
17:26
of it the schedule part of it but
17:28
there's also you know making sure you
17:30
have the clothes that feel comfortable
17:32
making sure you have snacks or water if
17:34
you need it water is hugely important
17:36
because not all hotels have like free
17:38
water bottles in the room so make sure
17:40
that you bring some water with you or
17:42
you have some way to go downstairs at
17:43
the hotel and buy water or whatever it
17:45
is bring a glass so you can fill it up
17:47
from the tap and then making sure I've
17:50
planned out what I'm going to eat and
17:53
how I'm gonna do that so I'm not making
17:54
all those decisions when I get there and
17:56
that's how I plan so what I'm going to
17:58
do right now is I'm going to go and
18:01
start planning out these scenes so let's
18:03
do it
18:07
[Music]

[Music]
18:31
hey guys so it is about 8 30 it has been
18:33
a busy day for a Saturday
18:36
I really am just reminding myself that
18:40
like I've got to start working in more
18:42
breaks into my week but it's just this
18:45
is the busiest time of year and it
18:47
always is the busiest time of year for
18:48
me so I'm just rolling with it I will
18:51
take a break in December and it will be
18:53
lovely but I just have to keep moving
18:56
forward and make sure that I'm taking
18:58
some time out of every day for myself so
19:01
I meant to pick up the camera a little
19:04
bit more this afternoon and then just
19:05
didn't do it so I ended up resting for a
19:08
little bit having a long like cup of tea
19:10
outside with my husband which was really
19:12
nice we went for a walk with the kids we
19:14
went out to get groceries I worked on my
19:17
presentation and I did not have any time
19:19
to work on my note cards so it's 8 30
19:22
and I've just gotten Evie down
19:24
but I haven't gotten any note cards done
19:27
for this trip and honestly the entire
19:30
trip success depends on these note cards
19:33
so I'm sitting here like okay
19:35
I have a thousand to do list items
19:38
running through my head but the main
19:40
thing right now is to try to just laser
19:43
focus in on getting 10 scenes down on
19:47
this piece of paper and if I can do that
19:49
then I know that I can be successful
19:50
tomorrow and the next day all I have to
19:52
do is just work through those scenes and
19:54
do the best I can and give myself
19:56
permission for it not to be perfect
19:58
writing but just to have an idea of what
20:00
I'm working on so that's the key right
20:02
now whether or not I'm gonna get any
20:04
actual words today is left to be
20:07
determined because I do also kind of
20:10
want to sit down and watch an episode or
20:11
two of something with my husband tonight
20:13
since I won't see him for the next
20:14
couple of days and then we're back at it
20:18
tomorrow so I feel like when you're in a
20:21
super busy time of your life at least
20:23
for me it's like I like being busy and I
20:26
thrive on having a lot to do and
20:29
following my passion and being you know
20:31
go go go during certain times of my life
20:34
but in order for me to have the stamina
20:37
to keep it up I also have to be taking
20:39
that time to like read a book sit around
20:41
with the kids go for a walk you know do
20:43
those kind of things so it's not just
20:45
like busy all day long and being frantic
20:47
it's just
20:48
be intentional with your breaks and then
20:51
be intentional and focused when it's
20:53
time to work so I'm just going to work
20:55
here and try to get these 10 scenes down
20:58
see how far I get and then make sure
21:01
there's still time to hang out with my
21:03
husband while I'm packing up my bags so
21:05
that's my plan and I'm ready to get
21:07
started okay let me just say this
21:10
because it is now like 8 45 which means
21:14
I just went into a complete Time Warp
21:16
for the last 15 minutes so sometimes
21:18
this is also how I know that I'm working
21:20
just a little bit too hard is that I
21:24
will just not be able to be focused I
21:26
literally just sat down and told you
21:27
guys how I was going to focus on these
21:29
note cards and then I got pulled into a
21:31
YouTube video which then pulled me into
21:33
some shorts which then pulled me into
21:35
some thoughts about other things and
21:37
then I suddenly was like why am I
21:38
sitting here watching this person dance
21:40
or like people talk about Ariana Grande
21:42
like we're done here I gotta get my work
21:45
done
21:46
but that for me is a Surefire clue that
21:50
I need a brain break especially because
21:53
I'm about to go away for a couple of
21:56
nights to work extra hard so I'm not
21:59
going to push myself too much tonight
22:00
I'm gonna try maybe for 30 minutes to an
22:04
hour and just get as far as I can get so
22:07
then I can work on these note cards
22:10
while I'm driving tomorrow because
22:13
I mean I won't actually be like working
22:15
on the note cards but I can be thinking
22:16
through what's going to go on the note
22:18
cards and I can use my
22:20
um voice app like text to speech text
22:24
because
22:26
when you start to see those signs that
22:29
you're starting to get a little bit too
22:30
tired or you're working too hard if you
22:32
don't back away from that and make some
22:35
adjustments that's when you start to get
22:37
yourself into trouble and this is
22:38
probably one of the biggest changes that
22:41
I have made in my life over the last
22:44
year or so when like we won't go into
22:47
the dark times that were this time last
22:51
year but I nearly broke myself trying to
22:55
get the hb90 planner and everything else
22:57
done while I also had severe emotional
23:00
reaction to everything that was going on
23:02
and I'm just never gonna put myself
23:04
through that again so if I can't work
23:06
joyfully and focused then I need to stop
23:09
and take care of myself and if that
23:11
means a video doesn't go up or it means
23:13
I don't win nanowrimo that is totally
23:15
okay because I would much rather be
23:17
healthy and happy so this is your
23:19
reminder too to try to pay attention to
23:21
what are the signs for you individually
23:24
that you just need need a little bit of
23:27
a break and I thought actually I was
23:29
doing great I'm excited but that is a
23:31
Surefire sign to me when I get pulled
23:33
into just random videos I realize that
23:35
my brain just kind of needs to let go
23:38
for a little while so I'm just going to
23:40
set a 30 minute timer and I'm gonna get
23:42
as far as I can get and then I'm going
23:43
to call it and go pack and just relax
23:46
for the rest of the night
23:49
[Music]
23:53
oh
23:57
[Music]
24:01
foreign
24:07
[Music]
24:15
[Music]
24:27
[Music]
24:30
okay so I did a 30 minute Sprint and
24:33
then continued to work for maybe like
24:35
five or ten minutes after and I did get
24:38
my 10 note card scenes I did not fill
24:40
them out the way I normally would
24:42
because that takes more time so I will
24:45
just think through each scene as I'm
24:48
driving tomorrow and keep notes on my
24:50
phone like with speech to text where I
24:53
will open up a document and keep working
24:55
on it there and then fill them out as
24:57
needed right before I work on a new
24:59
scene so that's a way to kind of save a
25:02
little bit of time and then once I got
25:04
those scenes figured out I sat down and
25:06
wrote one tiny piece of a scene and I
25:09
got 580 words exactly so I'm at 25
25:13
000 13 words
25:14
which
25:16
is not what I wanted for the day I am
25:19
six
25:21
6600 words behind so for me that's not
25:26
too far and truthfully even if I didn't
25:30
write another word at this point I think
25:32
I'm above what I did last year
25:34
throughout the entire piece of Nano and
25:37
I like these words and some of them are
25:39
going to stay whereas I threw out pretty
25:40
much everything I wrote last year so I'm
25:43
if I'm going to compare myself to myself
25:45
I'm doing better and I'm pretty proud of
25:47
that so it is now 9 30 so I'm gonna go
25:51
hang out with George I'm going to pack
25:53
my bags for tomorrow's trip and just get
25:57
everything ready to go so that I can
25:59
have a good morning tomorrow with the
26:01
kiddos and uh get on the road so
26:07
as of this sign off I will not see you
26:10
guys again until at least Tuesday that

it is November 18th Friday night it is
0:59
already 9 15 p.m so I have just made my
1:03
tea in my super cute Hello Kitty mug so
1:05
this is the mug that I got from the
1:09
Hello Kitty truck the cafe truck I
1:12
literally just went up to the front said
1:13
oh can I get one of everything and then
1:15
I got two of a few other things it was
1:17
so much fun and I love this little mug
1:19
so I'm having some tea in this mug I
1:21
have my candle lit I have my little uh
1:24
Pebbles here to track my word count and
1:27
I am ready to go it has been a very long
1:29
day Andrew had a half day today and he
1:32
is out now for the next 10 days for
1:34
Thanksgiving holiday and break so we
1:38
went out to lunch as a family I
1:40
organized Evie's closet because it has
1:42
gotten very cold here in Texas very fast
1:45
and it is super windy and it's biting
1:47
and I just don't have good clothes for
1:49
her because she has just grown so
1:51
quickly like kids do and so I had to buy
1:53
her basically a whole new wardrobe and
1:56
so I went through everything in her room
1:59
put out a bunch of clothes that we're
2:01
going to take to donation tomorrow
2:03
and I've got laundry going so I'm gonna
2:06
be kind of up and down back and forth
2:08
getting that kind of stuff done just
2:10
another part of being a mom
2:12
and taking care of the family
2:15
tomorrow is hopefully going to be a good
2:18
like planning and prep day for the hotel
2:21
weekend also if you're watching this the
2:23
day it comes out then Indie Rider Fest
2:26
has already begun this is a you know
2:29
just an indie conference online where
2:31
there's lots of really great topics and
2:33
there's other authortubers involved and
2:35
other best-selling authors involved it's
2:36
super fun the event is free I'm not sure
2:39
if you can still sign up but I will
2:41
leave the link down below just in case
2:42
you can I will be speaking tomorrow
2:44
about how to balance your marketing and
2:46
your writing and I think all of these
2:48
videos will go up on the Indie Rider
2:50
Fest YouTube channel later in the year
2:52
or soon so
2:55
that is another thing that I need to
2:57
practice for get ready for and then I
2:59
will do that presentation on Sunday and
3:01
then head to Austin and write but in
3:03
order to like not put too much on my
3:07
plate for that writing weekend too much
3:09
pressure I are writing Retreat I need to
3:13
try to keep up with at least 1400 words
3:15
a day to stay on track to have this hope
3:18
and the truth is I set this goal for
3:20
myself to hit the 50K by the end of the
3:22
month in order to get a new iPad and I
3:25
really would love to get that new iPad
3:26
and if I don't win Nano I can I can't
3:31
buy that iPad until next year so like
3:34
meaning next year Nano so I have to hold
3:36
off a whole year and I really want that
3:38
iPad because my iPad is old and the
3:41
screen is smaller and I want the big one
3:42
and I just really want to get it
3:45
so I have set this deal with myself and
3:47
I'm going to use that as my motivation
3:48
I'm going to hold that out as a little
3:50
carrot that I can earn and so I want to
3:52
stay
3:53
um I want to stay up to date so I'm
3:56
working on Piper's point of view I think
3:57
I'm going to make my way through some of
3:59
these flashbacks as I start to put these
4:00
puzzles together and then I'm going to
4:02
reward myself with a little bit of
4:03
popcorn after this I wish I had some
4:06
wine in the house because I would
4:07
definitely also reward myself with a
4:09
glass of wine tonight but I am going to
4:11
instead focus on the tea and I'm going
4:15
to get these words in so let's do it
4:19
[Music]
4:30
[Music]
4:45
thank you
4:48
foreign
4:52
foreign
4:56
Vlog but maybe we needed a short one
4:59
thrown in here uh I just can't keep
5:02
going I have reached a limit but I got
5:05
what I wanted to do so I ended up with
5:08
let me show you so you can see here it's
5:10
at 24
5:12
33 or I can go to tools and pull it up
5:15
here 24 433 I am writing these flashback
5:19
scenes so I have like three different
5:21
point of view scenes here and they're
5:23
not even really in order but I'm just
5:25
kind of following these uh things that I
5:28
know are gonna happen and I figure once
5:30
I have all the puzzle pieces on the
5:32
table so to speak then I can figure out
5:35
how they all go together and what I want
5:37
to do with them uh and actually it's
5:40
I've had some things that have surprised
5:42
me so far because I feel like I knew
5:46
where the scene was gonna go but I ended
5:49
up needing a little bit more like
5:51
backstory with some of the character
5:53
stuff and so I've been putting more
5:55
character things into here and each
5:57
person is coming out with their own what
5:59
I feel like is unique voice and I'm
6:01
learning more about them which is super
6:03
helpful and you know sometimes when
6:05
you're writing multiple POV that can be
6:07
super helpful too is just to
6:10
you know sometimes when you're writing
6:12
multiple POV especially when it's you
6:15
know something that you want to give
6:16
each character their own voice or you're
6:18
really trying to understand what their
6:20
character Arc is or what motivates them
6:22
sometimes if you get stuck with what's
6:25
going on the page and trying to figure
6:27
it out like all inside your mind it can
6:29
be so helpful to just put their point of
6:32
view down on paper because once you sort
6:35
of slide into their personality and
6:38
start talking like them you might be
6:40
surprised at how they are I don't know
6:43
how else to explain that but for me once
6:46
I start writing a character it's like
6:49
sometimes I think I know who they are I
6:51
can see a picture of them and how I
6:53
think they are like I know what's
6:55
supposed to be important to them but
6:57
then when I actually start writing their
6:59
words I realize that they have a certain
7:01
way of speaking or a certain way of
7:04
walking or certain habits that I wasn't
7:06
expecting and it's this is why I often
7:10
compare writing to Magic because I feel
7:12
like I have no idea sometimes what those
7:14
things are
7:16
until that character shows up on the
7:18
page but like where were those decisions
7:21
made how does that character created
7:23
because it wasn't something I was
7:25
consciously aware of so it's like is
7:27
this coming from something outside of
7:29
myself or is this just my subconscious
7:33
at work or is this just some kind of
7:35
Destiny thing and I know that sounds
7:37
very woo-woo and maybe because it's you
7:39
know 10 30 on a Friday night and I'm
7:40
tired but that is sometimes my belief is
7:43
like sometimes these characters and who
7:45
they are just come fully formed and they
7:48
have their own personalities that I did
7:51
not manipulate or create in any way they
7:53
just are who they are and I can't help
7:56
it and what's interesting about this
7:59
particular book is with so many points
8:01
of view and with Vanessa being gone and
8:04
it being really a mystery of what
8:06
happened to her and sort of this feeling
8:08
of like did someone who was there that
8:11
night hurt her or kill her or does
8:14
someone there know something more about
8:16
what happened than what you know and
8:19
they're all keeping secrets they all
8:21
have things that um
8:23
like reasons why Vanessa either wronged
8:27
them or had secrets on them or whatever
8:30
and so it's this balance of trying to
8:33
make these characters relatable but also
8:37
giving them flaws and things that
8:38
they're hiding from people and that's
8:40
really kind of a fun puzzle to to put
8:42
together but it's interesting that they
8:46
you know have their own personalities
8:48
right from the start like when I started
8:51
writing buddy it was like which that
8:54
name may change by the way it's just
8:55
whatever came to me first but
8:58
I just started hearing him in my head
9:01
and it's so strange because then when
9:03
I'm sitting down to write Finn it's like
9:05
this totally different character and I
9:07
haven't put a lot of thought ahead of
9:09
time into what those voices would be or
9:12
how they talk I've just been thinking
9:14
about like what's their backstory and
9:16
what's their secret and it's just kind
9:18
of interesting where does that come from
9:21
maybe it is Magic magic but either way
9:23
uh 24 433 into the Nano site is
9:30
1616 uh so that's a nice you know double
9:33
number there so 1616 which is 400 shy of
9:38
what my goal is for the day but like I
9:40
said really my goal according to my new
9:42
plan is about 1460 so I am ahead of that
9:45
so I'm still on track as long as I can
9:48
plan enough to have a 10 to 13 000 word
9:53
night at the hotel
9:56
tomorrow I will continue to work on plot
9:59
I will pack my bags I will get the
10:01
family ready probably go get groceries
10:03
finish up all that laundry get my Indie
10:06
Rider Fest speech together and then on
10:09
Sunday it'll be all about go time when I
10:13
go on writing Retreats especially if
10:16
they're multiple nights so this will be
10:17
two nights but I will have to drive home
10:19
after the second night so I can't like
10:21
stay up till 6am or I'll never be able
10:23
to drive safely so I like to go in with
10:26
a idea of what my goal is and a lot of
10:29
times I'll be thinking in terms of
10:30
Sprints so I'll say Okay Friday or not
10:33
Friday but Sunday night I should get
10:36
there and get settled by like five or
10:38
six and get dinner so maybe I'll start
10:40
writing by like 7 P.M so if I only want
10:43
to stay up till let's say 1am how many
10:45
Sprints do I want to try to do in that
10:47
time period and then according to my
10:50
average how many words do I think I can
10:52
get on Sunday night then Monday I'll
10:55
have a plan probably going to the EC
10:58
store and doing some shopping but trying
11:00
to write some in the morning and then
11:01
trying to
11:03
um you know figure out how late I want
11:05
to stay up so that I can drive safely
11:07
home on Tuesday so there's some thoughts
11:10
there and I'll come up with my goals and
11:12
I'll share those with you before I leave
11:13
and I'm looking forward to it so a
11:17
little bit of a shorter Vlog but I got
11:19
my words in I hope you're getting your
11:21
words in I hope you're having a good
11:22
time and yeah we're Trucking towards the
11:26
last week or so of Nano it is already
11:29
you know it's already the 18th so we're
11:31
down below two weeks remaining and some
11:34
of that is holiday so pace yourself
11:37
reset your goal if you need to and I
11:40

11:41
always cheering you on alright all my
11:43
love
11:44
good night
11:50
[Music]
so it is nearly 5 p.m and I'm just
4:24
getting started on this office and
4:27
writing stuff for the day because I have
4:28
been busy all day with admin tasks and
4:31
decision making and working on the hb90
4:33
2023 planner which is coming soon and
4:35
all that good stuff my Sterling ink
4:37
planner which is another you know
4:40
planner company she's mostly does
4:42
stickers and I've loved her because she
4:43
often has like florals and dragonflies
4:46
in her designs she has come out with her
4:48
own planner called I think the common
4:50
planner or commonplace planner I think
4:52
common planner and it is a B6 size
4:54
planner and I'm going to be using that
4:55
planner next year
4:57
uh for my like six months for Life tarot
5:00
Journal everything I'm I'm been spending
5:03
the last few days like when I have some
5:05
free time really thinking through my
5:07
planner systems for 2023 because I want
5:09
to do a trial run of some of that stuff
5:11
in December to make sure that's how I
5:13
want it to be so thank you to everybody
5:15
who suggested one of Cindy's most recent
5:17
videos about pulling out index cards and
5:19
trying to figure out the planner system
5:20
that works for you moving forward like
5:23
kind of evaluating your current planner
5:24
system if you're feeling the need to
5:26
simplify I found it super helpful and I
5:28
spent my whole morning with my index
5:30
cards and hanging out with Evie she was
5:32
putting makeup on my face I did not get
5:34
any recordings of this but it was kind
5:35
of funny and I was going through those
5:37
note cards so I will link Cindy's video
5:39
down below if you've also been thinking
5:41
about simplifying because I found it
5:42
very helpful so I will share with you
5:46
guys what those simplifying planners
5:49
will be as soon as we get into December
5:51
but that Sterling ink planner is getting
5:53
delivered today so I keep kind of
5:54
keeping you know I keep kind of watching
5:56

5:58
cannot wait to see it I got the half
5:59
year one so I'll share those with you
6:01
soon but
6:04
um I also have been working on
6:07
um my plan for the rest of November like
6:10
I was talking about in yesterday's vlog
6:12
and one of the things that I'm going to
6:14
be doing is I'm going to Austin
6:18
I'm so excited for this so I like to try
6:21
when I'm trying for a big writing goal
6:23
to do a hotel night and I call them Rita
6:26
paloozas I love it it's so much fun I've
6:28
been doing them since my son was six
6:30
months old and I can get so much done I
6:34
love just the immersion and the time to
6:37
prioritize my writing
6:39
it's gonna be awesome now I decided to
6:42
book a hotel in Austin for two nights so
6:44
I'll be there Sunday night and Monday
6:45
night because I also wanted to make a
6:48
trip to the Erin Condren physical store
6:51
I have never been to their store you
6:53
guys know I'm such a fan of easy
6:55
planners so I reached out to my rep Tori
6:58
to let her know I was coming and she's
6:59
going to put me in touch with the people
7:01
who work there so I can you know get a
7:04
tour or whatever else so I'm very
7:05
excited I'm going to share all that with
7:07
you guys and I'm gonna get some extra
7:08
little accessories and stuff so I'm like
7:10
hey I'm simplifying my planners and also
7:14
me
7:16
so I'm excited for that I can't wait to
7:18
share it with you and I'm hoping that I
7:20
am going to get some amazing writing
7:22
done and do some fun shopping maybe
7:24
Christmas shopping while I'm there so
7:25
I'll share that and I'm staying at a
7:27
super cute hotel and I can share with
7:29
you guys kind of how my hotel night
7:30
process goes and hopefully we'll be
7:33
cheering each other on so that's Sunday
7:35
and Monday night coming up but before we
7:38
get to Sunday or Monday night the Indie
7:40
Rider Fest is going on this weekend this
7:43
is an online conference most of the uh
7:46
conference workshops are being presented
7:48
via Zoom so if you want to get in you
7:51
can sign up down at the link down below
7:52
for Android Indie writer Fest it's going
7:55
on for Saturday and Sunday and I will be
7:57
speaking on Sunday about how to balance
8:00
marketing and writing so if you've been
8:02
interested in learning a little bit more
8:04
about how to plan and how much time you
8:06
should spend on marketing versus how
8:08
much time you should spend on your
8:09
writing and stuff like that definitely
8:11
come join us hopefully I'm gonna have
8:12
some good tips for you so that will be
8:14
on Zoom but it will also be recorded for
8:17
the VIP sessions and then I think later
8:19
it's all going up on her YouTube channel
8:21
for free but if you want to get in this
8:23
weekend and I would love to see some of
8:25
my hearties in the comments definitely
8:27
come join so I will leave that link down
8:29
below for you all of the times I think
8:31
listed on the site are GMT so I'm
8:34
speaking at 1900 GMT which is one
8:38
o'clock Central Time and 2 p.m Eastern
8:41
so I hope to see you there and then as
8:43
soon as I'm done with that I'm going to
8:44
be on the road to Austin for a couple
8:46
days and then before you know it the
8:49
month is over so I'm hoping for good
8:51
success but right now it's almost five
8:53
I've been working all day so I'm gonna
8:55
go hang out with the kids make some
8:57
dinner I think we're throwing steaks on
8:58
the grill and then I will be back later
9:01
tonight with some writing getting some
9:03
words in uh I probably will still be
9:05
doing a little bit of plotting and
9:06
planning because I feel like that's so
9:09
important for me to be doing the
9:10
plotting and planning right now because
9:12
if I want to make the most of that hotel
9:14
night I need to be in a place where I
9:16
can write a lot of words I can't be like
9:19
the most successful Hotel nights I've
9:20
had have been ones where I know exactly
9:22
what scenes are coming up and I can just
9:24
zoom through them
9:26
if I have to spend time that night
9:27
thinking what's happening in my story
9:29
then I just won't get a lot of words so
9:32
we're gonna try to set it up for a big
9:34
word nights and that means still more
9:37
plotting work but I'm still gonna try to
9:39
hit that like 14 to 1500 words at least
9:41
tonight so I don't fall too far behind
9:43
so all right I will see you guys tonight
9:46
okay that's right it's almost nine I'm
9:49
hoping to get at least an hour to an
9:51
hour and a half in tonight so let's do
9:53
this uh Rhiannon is live in the
9:55
heartbreakings writing Community also
9:56
let me show you what I got in the mail I
9:58
got my Sterling ink planners if you guys
10:01
have not seen these she released a
10:05
common planner I will link to them
10:07
because I think I'll link to her site
10:08
because I think that she's going to have
10:10
some extras I ended up getting the half
10:13
year so it's the year divided into six
10:16
months each because I do a sort of
10:19
program that I'm just my own personal
10:21
thing it's not like an official program
10:22
called six months for life and I thought
10:25
this would be perfect to split it into
10:27
two so I've got six months right it's
10:31
very similar to a hobonichi but it is a
10:36
B6 size so you have like a yearly
10:38
overview and I will link to her Channel
10:41
where she'll show you like all this and
10:43
I'll talk about it more in my planner
10:45
lineup but it came so beautifully
10:48
packaged in this really nice box that'll
10:50
be so nice for keepsakes later it also
10:53
has this gorgeous gold like
10:56
sparkly detail on the pages
11:00
I love it I'm so excited to have it even
11:03
though I can't start planning it yet I'm
11:05
so excited to have it so the mauve one
11:07
is for the first half of the year and
11:08
the black one is for the second half of
11:10
the Year cannot wait but I'm gonna go
11:13
hang out with Rhiannon and I'm gonna get
11:14
some writing done so let's go foreign
11:18
[Music]
11:45
[Applause]
11:45
[Music]
11:53
[Music]
12:04
foreign
12:09
[Music]
12:13
okay I have been writing for quite a
12:16
while it is now getting close to 11 p.m
12:19
and my eyes are just starting to get
12:21
really tired
12:22
but it is making me remember all this
12:25
night writing is making me remember how
12:27
I actually finished books when I had a
12:30
baby my first baby because I could only
12:34
write at night so this is similar it's
12:36
kind of like I have a full-time job
12:38
during the day with heart breathings and
12:40
then I write at night and I'm kind of
12:43
remembering that yeah I I want to put
12:46
time into this I either have to create
12:48
space in my daily work or I need to make
12:52
time for it at night and I've actually
12:53
been enjoying this but I also know that
12:56
it's not totally sustainable for me to
12:58
write for like hours at a time every
12:59
night but even if I could choose to do
13:02
this a couple of nights a week and then
13:05
fit in a few coffee shop trips
13:07
throughout the week
13:09
it would even out into some good writing
13:11
sessions even if I didn't write every
13:14
day I think sometimes there's this
13:15
feeling that like if you are a serious
13:17
writer you must write every day or
13:19
you're not you know really taking it
13:21
seriously or making a priority and for
13:23
some reason even though I know that's
13:24
not true it still sticks in my head
13:26
sometimes so I'm feeling very encouraged
13:29
because I'm like oh I do kind of get to
13:32
decide how I want to fit this into my
13:35
life I just need to start getting
13:36
creative about it and really like get
13:40
into the story and know that
13:44
I can make time for this I don't know
13:46
it's it's a shift I'm feeling a shift
13:48
anyway I did very well tonight
13:52
so hopefully that'll show up but I got I
13:54
got to 22 817 so I was at
13:58
28.55 so just shy
14:01
let's see 22 8
14:05
17.
14:08
so just shy of 2000 words 1962. oh my
14:11
gosh it says to stay on par needed 20
14:14
2082. so
14:17
all right I should have tried to get
14:19
that extra hundred words but I'm gonna
14:21
leave that for tomorrow and you know I'm
14:24
here's what I'm seeing like maybe I'm
14:27
below where the par is but look at this
14:29
line y'all I'm writing and that feels
14:32
good and I'm not gonna judge whether
14:35
it's writing at somebody else's
14:36
predetermined success Pace but I'm just
14:40
gonna say I'm really proud of myself
14:42
because this time last year
14:44
I was not writing like this so this is
14:46
Improvement and I'm feeling really
14:49
encouraged by it so I took some time
14:51
tonight to write a flashback scene a
14:55
couple of flashback scenes
14:57
um and this is all thanks to a lot of
14:59
the work I did on the timeline this kind
15:01
of looks a mess but I put present day
15:04
timeline here and then leading to
15:05
timeline and I kind of put my
15:08
um
15:09
my main Act One climax midpoint etc etc
15:13
here and then down here I put the
15:16
different events and like I said it's
15:18
kind of a mess I need to actually put it
15:19
up on the big wall but it brought me
15:23
some clarity about the fact that when
15:26
I'm doing this
15:28
like double timeline stuff here
15:32
I'm really I don't know how to explain
15:34
it exactly but I've gotten so many good
15:36
ideas as of the last few days about
15:38
really how this past timeline and these
15:42
flashbacks are going to tie into the
15:44
present and not only that but what I was
15:47
thinking of yesterday and the day before
15:48
on our date night is how these
15:51
flashbacks tie into each other and it's
15:54
really got me excited for the writing so
15:56
I
15:58
am just going to keep you know plugging
16:01
away
16:02
so that's it for day 17. we are done for
16:05
the night and so I'm gonna go
16:08
like Splash my face with some cold water
16:11
maybe make a tea do a little bit of
16:13
reading my tarot cards
16:15
and go to bed feeling satisfied and
16:18
happy and grateful for the opportunity
16:21
to be writing the story and to be a
16:23
writer and to just be here I'm grateful
16:27
to be here and I'm grateful for all of
16:29
you that are sticking with me it's so
16:31
cool to see each day that there's
16:33
thousands of people that are following
16:35
this journey and I just feel grateful
16:37
and humbled and excited every single day
16:40
that you guys are here and you're on
16:42
this journey with me so thank you for
16:43
being here I love you I'm cheering for
16:46
you
16:47
and I will see you tomorrow day 18. all
16:51
right bye
16:53
foreign
16:56
[Music]
shopping is self-care for me
0:05
[Music]
0:11
[Music]
0:27
Midway through day 15 we are here and we
0:33
are doing our best we should be at the
0:35
25
0:36
000 word Mark today I'm at 18 000 and we
0:39
have a date night tonight and I have a
0:41
live stream tonight so I am not fooling
0:43
myself thinking that I'm gonna fully
0:45
catch up today but I would like to get
0:47
some writing done so I have brought just
0:49
like a Lunchable which is not not a
0:52
healthy lunch do not recommend but it's
0:54
what I'm gonna be able to do quickly
0:55
today and I am going to sit at my desk
0:58
and I'm gonna write I have my good
1:00
friend Jen is here with me on zoom and
1:03
we're gonna do a little bit of writing
1:05
so I'm ready day 15. let's do this
1:09
[Music]
1:21
thank you
1:28
[Music]
1:33
okay so I hit 19 200 or so words during
1:40
my Sprints with Jen and I'm getting
1:42
ready for a live stream coming up at
1:44
three I just ate lunch at my desk which
1:46
I don't always do but it was nice um
1:49
Evie was kind of missing me though so I
1:51
don't want to do that too often but it
1:53
was nice to have this big computer here
1:56
it's funny how just one simple change
1:59
can make a big difference and I think
2:01
that having that small smaller screen of
2:05
the laptop and it being so far away for
2:07
me because I wanted to use a different
2:08
keyboard was actually like hindering my
2:11
flow which sounds ridiculous but it is
2:14
true and so yeah I'm sitting here
2:17
thinking okay we're halfway through
2:18
supposed to be at 25 000 today let me
2:21
see if I can get to 20K and then date
2:24
night tonight we were thinking of going
2:26
to see a movie but I think right now
2:28
instead what I'd rather do is let's
2:30
we're going to do a little bit of
2:31
shopping because I want to see if I can
2:33
find some inspiration for this area and
2:35
that will be shopping as self-care for
2:38
me
2:39
so that'll be a little bit of self-care
2:41
it is like George's least favorite thing
2:43
to do but he will do it for me
2:45
and then we'll go eat a good dinner and
2:47
I think I'm gonna take all of my
2:49
plotting materials with me to dinner and
2:51
we're just gonna have a plot session and
2:53
that will be fun and enjoyable and there
2:57
are times where it's like okay I need to
2:59
actually step away from my work and
3:01
there are other times where I feel like
3:02
it's so helpful to have that partner to
3:05
go through some of my stuff with but
3:07
anyway I just saw Amazon drop off
3:10
another box and opened it up and so some
3:14
of my packages or books that are still
3:16
coming in are coming in kind of
3:18
piecemeal because I open up this smaller
3:20
box and it has some of my missing
3:22
Fairhope books so this is book two of
3:24
that series it has book two and some of
3:27
book five so that should complete I
3:29
think everything I needed for Fair Hope
3:31
but there's still other books like
3:33
Sarah's gift and some of the demon
3:36
series stuff and we still haven't even
3:37
dealt with this but we were kind of
3:39
letting Evie play in it like a little uh
3:43
a little Fortress there so that'll be
3:45
fun uh but yeah the books are kind of
3:47
coming in piecemeal but it's still
3:49
pretty exciting so thank you for sharing
3:51
in my joy of getting these books
3:52
yesterday really cool moment I am also
3:55
very slowly working on christmasifying
3:58
my house not all in one day but just
4:01
here and there and I just got so I have
4:06
this Merry Christmas that I had put up
4:08
something else here and then changed it
4:10
to this and moved to the wreath I had up
4:12
here to the front door because I found
4:14
this at Walmart and I thought it was so
4:16
cute and then I just got some Christmas
4:19
towels to hang here so it's like I'm
4:22
just gonna add tiny little touches we
4:24
put this um runner on the table this
4:27
morning it's not quite long enough but I
4:30
think it still looks cute and so yeah
4:33
I'm I'm getting there let me know in the
4:35
comments if you have started decorating
4:36
for Christmas or if you think it's just
4:38
way too early because I never decorate
4:40
this early but I am feeling it I'm all
4:42
about it right now okay got my little
4:46
sparkling water drink
4:49
more words
4:50
see if I can hit 20K side note I'm
4:53
loving using these little
4:55
Pebbles however Evie also loves them and
4:59
because they're on my desk she keeps
5:01
grabbing them and I just found my Hello
5:03
Kitty she said the Hello Kitty Crystal
5:06
was taking a bath
5:08
and then she also keeps putting
5:12
some of the letters and like this is the
5:14
little Moon from my letter board in here
5:18
okay so let's let's try this again
5:31
[Music]
5:43
okay so I got to 19
5:45
398 so almost 400 but then this little
5:48
one came in and wants me to play with
5:50
her and have not seen her much this
5:52
morning yeah
5:55
um so I'm gonna take some time out we're
5:56
gonna hang out we're gonna play some
5:58
games or something and then I got a live
6:00
stream coming up at three my time and
6:03
then we've got that night it's a long
6:05
day busy day happy day
6:08
foreign
6:09
[Music]
6:46
foreign
6:47
[Music]
6:54
went so well thank you to everybody who
6:57
joined us it's always so much fun to
6:58
chat with fellow authors now I have
7:01
gotten my bag ready so I'm going to show
7:03
you what I'm taking with me because
7:04
we're going to be plotting and I think
7:06
we might go to IKEA so I have this
7:09
beautiful Michael Kors bag I think it's
7:11
called the Corinne bag that I got on
7:13
sale probably because this sort of blush
7:15
tan color is not in season but I'm still
7:17
gonna use it so it has a really nice big
7:21
opening it's kind of like a bucket you
7:23
know and I love this type of bag
7:25
and then I bought this little purse
7:27
insert on Amazon up babysitter's here so
7:31
I have my plotting notebook my uh like
7:35
pen case I've got my wallet and
7:38
everything else in here and I've got a
7:40
stash of other extra pins over here and
7:43
it's heavy for sure if you don't like
7:45
heavy bags this is going to make it
7:46
heavier than it would be if it was like
7:47
a backpack but I don't really want to
7:49
take a backpack on date night so here we
7:52
go
7:54

[Music]
8:47
okay guys date night is coming to a
8:50
close we're gonna play a little bit of
8:51
Minecraft it's about 10 30 and I'm
8:54
already in my PJs I had two more boxes
8:57
of books waiting for me and we're still
8:59
waiting for a few more boxes before that
9:01
is all finished but it's fun to see them
9:02
all come in and I asked my babysitter if
9:05
she wanted to help me like get these
9:07
packaged up and make a little extra cash
9:09
and see she said yes so hopefully she's
9:12
gonna help me out with that super fun
9:13
George and I had such a good time
9:16
sitting there
9:18
um and Talking Through the story and
9:20
then we had coffee afterward and really
9:22
talked through some of the secrets and
9:24
how they're going to get woven in and I
9:26
just feel super pumped and super excited
9:28
I don't have every tiny thing figured
9:30
out but I have a few more pieces of the
9:33
puzzle and it feels really good so
9:36
no more writing today I had thought
9:37
about coming home and trying to hit that
9:39
20K because I'm only about 650 or so
9:42
words away from it but I think I'm just
9:45
gonna call it a night it's been a long
9:47
day with that extra live stream and
9:48
everything else but it has been such a
9:50
good day I'm feeling good I'm feeling
9:52
excited I'm feeling super joyful and
9:54
happy and that's all you can ask for you
9:57
know and so I'm gonna end it here and
10:01
tomorrow we go for 20K so today's par
10:04
was 25 which means tomorrow will be 26
10:07
667 or whatever so I'm behind but I have
10:12
a plan for catching up so tomorrow we
10:14
will talk about that catch-up plan and
10:17
I'll give you some of my personal tips
10:19
for what to do if you're behind right
10:21
now and still hoping to catch up or if
10:24
you're behind and you know you're not
10:25
going to catch up for how to still kind
10:27
of get yourself through it without
10:29
feeling bad or like a failure because
10:32
you aren't a failure like if you've
10:34
written anything this month you're still
10:35
still moving forward it just might not
10:38
be the expectation that you had and
10:40
that's okay so it's okay to feel
10:41
disappointed but it's also okay to feel
10:45
really proud of yourself and to give
10:46
yourself a break so we'll talk more
10:48
about that tomorrow but anyway I will
10:50
also share what I ended up buying at The
10:53
Container Store because I was not even
10:55
planning to go there tonight but I am
10:58
very happy that I got some really cute
11:00
stuff so I will show you what I got and
11:02
we'll talk tomorrow good night you guys
11:07

hey you guys so it is day 14 and my
0:05
books are here
0:09
[Music]
0:15
[Music]
0:30
so all of I don't know if this is
0:33
everything because we had gotten a
0:34
message that some of the things were
0:36
delayed but this is all books that are
0:39
for my book signing and I have these
0:41
like I have all these extra boxes that I
0:43
need to get rid of and I need to clean
0:45
this space I need to clear this off I
0:47
need to unpack all of these boxes so
0:51
that I can make space and we're going to
0:52
move a folding table in so that I can
0:55
take all the books out of boxes and
0:58
count them make sure nothing's damaged
0:59
in fact it is a super super cold and
1:04
rainy day here in the Dallas area and
1:08
the Amazon delivery guy just left them
1:11
all outside in the rain and
1:14
I think that we saw them fast enough
1:16
that they are not damaged they don't
1:18
seem to be super wet but of course I
1:20
want to check them make sure because if
1:23
if they're messed up then I'm gonna need
1:25
to
1:26
you know Place another order I have also
1:28
placed a new order for some swag items
1:32
like stickers and different things like
1:33
that and I created a custom packing tape
1:37
so that stuff will be here early next
1:39
week which should give me enough time to
1:41
get everything situated and start
1:43
signing and then we can box them up and
1:45
I think I need to see if I can use
1:48
taskrabbit or something like that to
1:50
hire someone locally that can help me
1:51
get these boxes out because there's a
1:54
lot going on with HP 90 coming up and
1:57
trying to finish this book that I'm
1:58
gonna need a little bit of help but
2:00
we're going to make this like signing
2:02
Central so it's pretty exciting
2:06
foreign
2:09
[Music]
2:38
foreign
2:40
[Music]
2:58
okay so I just counted them up because I
3:02
knew this wasn't everything because I
3:05
don't have like a missing some of my
3:08
Fair Hope series which by the way is my
3:10
only like contemporary romance series
3:13
it's a new adult contemporary romance
3:15
there are missing books two and four and
3:17
then I'm missing some of the other books
3:19
there I'm missing almost all of sorrow's
3:22
gift I'm missing book
3:25
um
3:26
I've got a lot of book ones of my series
3:28
but I don't have books two and three
3:30
four five six
3:32
seven but I'm missing book eight I'm
3:35
missing most of book ten so I just
3:37
counted them up so this is what
3:39
450 books look like so total with all of
3:45
these this is 450 books and then I have
3:47
about a hundred more
3:49
still on the way so hopefully they will
3:51
be here soon and I can start packaging
3:53
things up and it's really exciting I
3:56
ordered packing tape and some stickers
3:58
and other swag to go in the boxes I have
4:00
a bunch of boxes here as well as bubble
4:03
mailers and stuff like that so I'll
4:04
definitely be sharing the book signing
4:06
with you guys it's like I I was telling
4:08
my husband like if I could go back in
4:11
time and tell myself 12 years ago that
4:15
someday I would be like stacking up
4:18
piles of books that I wrote that people
4:21
actually wanted me to sign for them I
4:24
just wouldn't have believed it and I
4:26
know that in the grand scheme of things
4:27
there are people who sign this many
4:30
books you know every month or often but
4:32
it's just it's the first time I've ever
4:34
signed so many and it just means the
4:36
world to me and
4:38
so if you are sitting here watching this
4:40
and thinking oh that's really cool I'm
4:42
trying to finish my first book just know
4:44
that like maybe in a few short years
4:46
you're gonna have just stacks of your
4:48
own books here and you're going to have
4:49
all these readers that are so excited to
4:51
see your book and this is why we do it
4:54
you know is is not only for ourselves
4:56
and our ability to tell the stories but
4:58
also
4:59
to reach the readers and change their
5:01
lives and entertain them and you know
5:04
tell tell these stories that they want
5:06
to read so it's just really cool and I'm
5:09
feeling very humbled and grateful right
5:11
now
5:12
so it has been another long and
5:15
productive day but I didn't get that
5:17
chunk of time because we had the books
5:19
and because they had been in the rain I
5:21
had to you know prioritize that and I
5:23
know in a previous video there were
5:25
several comments that said like it's
5:26
your fault you're just not prioritizing
5:28
your writing and in a way you're right
5:30
but at the same time I'm running
5:33
multiple businesses with a toddler at
5:35
home and there's a lot that goes into
5:37
that and shuffling priorities and trying
5:41
to make sure that it's all getting done
5:43
and sometimes there are other things
5:46
that keep coming up and in a lot of ways
5:48
you know the the pro problem so to speak
5:51
is that the writing right now doesn't
5:54
have a specific deadline but the books
5:57
have a deadline people are waiting on
5:59
them there's an expectation there I want
6:01
to make sure that they're not damaged so
6:02
there's work that needs to be done there
6:04
I have meetings that I can't just you
6:07
know not show up for I have
6:09
um you know I can't just like
6:11
dip out and go right for three weeks and
6:14
not take care of my toddler like I do
6:16
have certain priorities that are in
6:18
place and
6:20
it may look sometimes from the outside
6:21
like oh you're prioritizing this Vlog
6:23
over your writing but it's not just as
6:25
simple as like one Vlog I am
6:27
prioritizing this part of my career this
6:30
part of my passion sharing my experience
6:33
and building a community
6:35
and I'm still getting my writing done
6:37
I'm just not getting it done at the pace
6:39
of 50 000 words a month you know right
6:41
now so I think that we all have the
6:44
things that we juggle and so if you've
6:46
been hard on yourself too or you've had
6:47
people telling you you're just not
6:49
making it a priority just take a deep
6:52
breath and say I am doing the best I can
6:54
and I think the key too is
6:57
it has not been able to be a number one
7:00
priority for me at all times but I am
7:02
still always making progress it's just
7:04
not as fast of progress as I want and I
7:07
have been prioritizing other pieces of
7:09
my passion work that has made a real
7:12
difference in people's lives and yes I
7:14
have prioritized that and I'm not going
7:15
to apologize for it but I'm still
7:17
looking for Solutions right and I think
7:19
as long as we continue to look for those
7:21
Solutions and look for the ways that we
7:23
can continue to improve continue to
7:25
expand and grow
7:28
that is the way to go but the trick is
7:32
trying not to be too hard on yourself on
7:34
the journey there and that for me is one
7:37
of the hardest things and I'm you know
7:40
recovering perfectionists when it comes
7:41
to those things because I want to be
7:43
able to put my passion and my all into
7:45
every one of those projects and maybe
7:48
it's partially like
7:50
as a woman who historically you know
7:52
we've been told like stay in your lane
7:54
these are the things you're allowed to
7:55
do you can't have it all maybe there's
7:57
that Rebel part of me that's like but I
7:59
want it all and I'm capable of it all
8:01
and I'm gonna find a way to do it so
8:03
just watch me do it
8:05
um and I feel that passion of like I
8:08
feel that I can be a writer and I can
8:11
share my story and I can raise a family
8:13
and be a good wife and I can have all of
8:15
those things I just gotta keep searching
8:18
for the key and try to continue to give
8:22
myself a break
8:23
and not expect so much of myself all the
8:26
time
8:27
um and it's you know it's a journey it's
8:29
that's why I'm sharing these Vlogs not
8:31
because I'm perfect
8:33
um if I was perfect like what would be
8:35
the value in watching The Journey right
8:37
it's it's all about
8:39
trying to figure it out and that's
8:41
really what I'm sharing because I know
8:43
there's a lot of you out there who have
8:44
full-time jobs and you have families and
8:46
you have people that you care take for
8:48
or you have chronic illnesses and you're
8:50
sitting there like everybody else seems
8:52
to have it together well this is my
8:54
example of how I do not have it all
8:56
together and I'm still trying to find my
8:58
way and every day is a balancing act and
9:01
every day is a
9:03
search for joy and a search for my best
9:06
self and trying to maximize my potential
9:08
without being too hard on myself and you
9:11
know we're all in this together and so
9:13
I'm just my passion is sharing that part
9:15
of the journey so that you know you're
9:16
not alone and that you know that as long
9:19
as you don't give up
9:21
there is success to be had
9:24
and I hope that that does mean something
9:26
to some of you okay so the other Amazon
9:29
delivery today was new pillow covers I'm
9:33
gonna be switching out this green
9:36
pillows and stuff for red and I'm ready
9:39
to start decorating I really want to go
9:41
shopping for Christmas but again that
9:43
can't be a number one priority but I've
9:45
got a table runner I've got a couple of
9:47
other
9:48
um covers that are going to go over
9:50
these little kind of Lumbar pillows and
9:52
then the brighter red is going to go in
9:54
the back and I have a red blanket coming
9:56
and then I have some signs that will go
9:58
up on the wall here that are more
10:00
Christmassy so I'm pretty excited to do
10:02
that I actually kind of want to put a
10:05
Little Nail right there and put a big
10:07
wreath right there I think that would
10:09
just be so beautiful to have a big
10:10
wreath on the wall above the bed so
10:12
thinking of that I also have all of the
10:16
2023 planners or some of the 2023
10:18
planners that I've purchased here and
10:20
tonight I'm planning to spend just a
10:22
little bit of time thinking through how
10:24
I'm going to simplify my system because
10:26
I am going to be simplifying and I'm
10:28
nervous about it but I'm also excited
10:30
because I think I need some shifts
10:34
and speaking of shifts I was talking to
10:38
my husband pretty late into the night
10:40
last night and I think that I'm going to
10:44
completely reimagine how I have this
10:46
room not necessarily how I have it set
10:48
up but how I have it decorated because I
10:52
feel like even though I put little bits
10:54
of color here I've really made this room
10:57
a little bit too dark for my personality
10:59
I was trying to kind of explore like the
11:02
darker side of like the herbs and the
11:04
earthiness of
11:06
um the Browns and the wood but it's just
11:09
I feel like my personality is not coming
11:11
through in this room and I think that
11:12
it's affecting my creativity in this
11:15
room I know that sounds like such a
11:17
simple thing but I think I'm feeling
11:19
really drawn toward redoing this room
11:21
setting my witchy or my like room that
11:25
has the bookshelves up as more of like a
11:27
permanent recording space and then
11:29
moving my desktop like mac into here
11:33
instead of using a laptop in here all
11:35
the time so I'm thinking through some
11:37
changes but I really need to be also
11:40
writing so the next stage here for the
11:43
next hour is I'm going to pull out this
11:45
graph paper I've got my sticky notes and
11:48
stuff like that and I also need to go
11:50
and search for all of my color-coded
11:53
tombows and I'm going to start trying to
11:55
work through some of that timeline and
11:57
then I will just join in with Rhiannon
12:00
and Sprints tonight to do a little bit
12:02
more writing
12:04
okay change is happening
12:08
think I would get more use in this room
12:10
out of a couch or chair like a love seat
12:14
something comfy here then this extra
12:17
piece of furniture I'm going to keep the
12:19
other two because they're absolutely
12:20
full of stuff but this one is mostly
12:22
full of like my tarot cards
12:25
um and some of the like some some of my
12:29
art supplies but I could fit those in
12:31
another space plus I have this whole
12:32
closet here to work with so I thinking
12:35
about buying a couch and Black Friday
12:38
time is the perfect time to be thinking
12:40
about it and just completely taking this
12:42
all this decoration down and starting
12:44
over but anyway can't think about that
12:46
right now another thing that I did was I
12:49
brought my iMac in here instead of
12:52
writing on my laptop I'm going to try
12:54
this so I'm also going to be using the
12:55
super
12:57
click the keyboard I got this from
13:00
Amazon I can't remember exactly how much
13:02
it was but I think it was less than
13:04
fifty dollars and I really like it it is
13:06
not wireless
13:08
um but maybe I'll do a key full keyboard
13:10
video soon but I think I'm going to get
13:13
more use out of this iMac in here
13:16
and so let's get some writing done uh
13:19
thank you to uh several of you who
13:22
suggested just write out the secrets and
13:25
the timeline and stuff that I'm working
13:26
on like I already know everybody's
13:28
Secrets I have them detailed here but I
13:32
don't know exactly how they're
13:34
discovered when they're revealed and
13:35
that kind of thing so that's what I'm
13:37
going to work on right now it is already
13:40
uh nine o'clock at night so I'm gonna
13:43
log in and Sprint with Rhiannon and I'm
13:46
going to work on these secrets
13:49
um in this book in my graph paper and
13:53
I'm going to actually just write down my
13:56
brainstorm thoughts and count it as
13:57
words and hopefully that will be
13:59
embracing my process here
14:02
[Music]
14:09
[Applause]
14:09
[Music]
14:16
thank you
14:18
[Music]
14:22
foreign
14:28
[Music]
14:36
so I ended up following the suggestion
14:40
of just working on my brainstorming
14:43
inside the document and I don't want to
14:45
do this too much because I want to
14:48
actually get words and finish this book
14:49
but if it helps me hit my Nano word
14:52
count and it's also kind of thinking
14:55
through future scenes and I feel like
14:56
that's not all that different from like
14:58
a zero draft if you're familiar with
15:00
that so I'm going to count it so I ended
15:04
up with 1291 words tonight so let me
15:07
show you so here you can see I've got
15:10
18071 and I just basically was like okay
15:13
I'm gonna do a Secrets brainstorm and
15:16
I'm going to find out this information
15:17
about them and then I just put each
15:19
character color coded as to what their I
15:23
knew their secrets going into it and had
15:25
already journaled it in here in terms of
15:27
their basic Secrets but what I didn't
15:30
know and what I was trying to figure out
15:31
is like how did Vanessa find out about
15:33
their secret or you know when does the
15:35
that come out in the present timeline so
15:37
I still have more to add to this
15:39
tomorrow but I feel like it's a good
15:41
start and when I put that into Nano
15:45
website I ended up with 12.91 for the
15:48
day but
15:51
tomorrow I mean I'm still I'm at 18
15:54
000.71 so I'm still you know 5 000 words
15:58
or so behind but as long as I don't fall
16:02
like ridiculously behind and I still
16:04
continue to get some words every day
16:05
then I can always open myself up for a
16:07
big push at the end so not too bad
16:10
I also have
16:12
um really enjoyed this keyboard I really
16:14
love mechanical clicky keyboards and so
16:18
this one I have been enjoying and then I
16:21
also just set up my iPad over here with
16:23
like a witchy Ambiance Channel and I was
16:25
doing sprints with Rhiannon and I really
16:27
feel like having this really massive
16:30
monitor here instead of the laptop is
16:33
helpful for me and I really like it and
16:36
so I'm glad that I made that choice and
16:38
yeah good progress so thank you for
16:41
hanging out with me it means so much
16:43

hey everybody happy Sunday today is a
0:30
planning day and I'm excited because
0:33
today is like last week I was traveling
0:37
and speaking and everything else so this
0:39
past week was a little bit more chaotic
0:42
because we had you know sickness and
0:44
other things but today is a true
0:48
like let's plan let's get out ahead of
0:50
it let's make sure the next couple of
0:51
weeks are really great Andrew will
0:54
hopefully be going back to school
0:55
tomorrow he's over here playing video
0:57
games and so I just looked at the
1:01
schedule and realized oh my gosh Friday
1:03
is a half day for him and then he's out
1:06
all next week because it's already
1:07
Thanksgiving and I just feel like what
1:10
is happening to this year it has gone by
1:12
so fast it's blowing my mind
1:16
it's hard to even believe that a year
1:18
ago we were on the road still and just
1:21
how much our lives have changed in the
1:23
last year but I'm pumped for everything
1:26
that's coming up I feel like so many of
1:28
the dreams I have been working toward
1:31
for the past more than decade of my life
1:33
are like within my grasp and I'm just
1:37
pumped for it I'm excited for it and so
1:39
I'm ready to get out ahead of my
1:40
schedule I'm ready to plan really well
1:42
for the next few weeks and yeah let's do
1:45
this I'm ready to finish this book I'm
1:47
only through the First Act but I can
1:49
feel the momentum of having sat down and
1:51
done some work so today I'm going to I
1:54
just started my computer back up I've
1:55
got to edit the day 12 Vlog then we'll
1:58
have lunch because it's already been
2:00
kind of a like lazy hang out with the
2:03
kids sort of morning
2:04
and then this afternoon it's going to be
2:08
all about planning next week getting the
2:10
groceries planned meal planned prepping
2:12
for the week I have a presentation for
2:14
my publish and Thrive crew but it's
2:15
going to be a busy day I always feel
2:17
like Sundays and Mondays are kind of my
2:19
power days
2:20
um I know for a lot of people Sundays
2:22
are rest days and Mondays they hate like
2:24
the beginning of the week but for me
2:25
Sunday and Monday are like my power team
2:28
I love these two days and I always get
2:30
pumped for prepping for a fresh start
2:32
and a new week so let's do this
2:36
[Music]
2:44
foreign
2:45
[Music]
3:16
[Music]
3:21
thank you
3:23
[Music]
3:33
this isn't the best lighting but I
3:35
finished my planning so this is all of
3:39
my tasks that I hope to do this week
3:42
this is my estimate of how long all of
3:45
these tasks will take and I'll keep
3:47
track of my time throughout the week and
3:49
then my week on two pages spread is
3:52
basically where I take all of the tasks
3:54
I hope to do and I schedule them out as
3:56
to when I plan to do them as well as
3:59
what other obligations and things that I
4:02
have and of course as I'm doing this I
4:05
am thinking not only about catching up
4:07
so I've made a little note here that
4:09
nanowrimo goal by Friday is thirty three
4:11
thousand three thirty three so I have a
4:14
lot of catching up to do I basically
4:16
need to more than double my word count
4:18
this week so if I'm going to catch up
4:21
this week that's my goal and so I have
4:23
created space each day to do that but
4:26
I'm also looking forward ahead to what
4:29
else is coming up in November and
4:31
December so that I can make sure that
4:33
I've got my hb90 planner ready to go and
4:35
you know the course is ready to be
4:37
launched and all that stuff because this
4:40
this week is not just about this week
4:43
next weekend like a week from you know
4:46
this like two weeks I guess from today
4:48
we're going to be launching uh hb90
4:51
class so like all that work has to get
4:53
started this week so I'm always kind of
4:55
thinking and working a couple weeks
4:57
ahead so I've got all those plans
5:00
and then I also like to on Sundays go
5:03
ahead and start planning out exactly how
5:06
I'm going to spend my time on Monday as
5:08
well and I have a bunch of sort of admin
5:11
tasks and meetings and things like that
5:12
that happen on Mondays so it's going to
5:15
be a busy week but hopefully it's going
5:16
to be a good writing week however I
5:19
haven't written today and we're coming
5:21
across like 9 00 p.m yet again so I'm
5:25
gonna go jump in and see who is
5:27
sprinting tonight and I'm gonna see if I
5:29
can jump in for a couple Sprints and try
5:30
to get at least a thousand words so I
5:32
don't have a zero day
5:34
okay so I made some spearmint tea which
5:38
by the way I have PCOS polycystic
5:41
ovarian syndrome if you do too which I
5:43
know a lot of women in our community do
5:45
spearmint tea makes such a difference in
5:48
my symptoms I've been trying to drink
5:50
spearmint tea two to three times a day
5:52
and I love it it's tasty and you can do
5:56
like spearmint peppermint but not just
5:58
peppermint spearmint tea a few times a
6:01
day can help a lot with your symptoms so
6:03
if you enjoy that go for it you can do
6:04
it iced or hot
6:07
um I am sprinting with Lisa so she is
6:10
live right now on YouTube and on
6:13
Facebook so we've got a lot of people
6:16
hanging out and sprinting with us she
6:18
sprints on Monday nights but we have
6:20
somebody sprinting every single day of
6:23
the week sometimes multiple times a day
6:24
so if you want to come join us that link
6:26
is always in the description for the
6:27
heartbreakings writing community and
6:29
people Sprint on Facebook or YouTube so
6:32
I have my notes here and I'm going to
6:34
start working on act two like exactly
6:37
how I want it to go and I don't
6:39
anticipate that I'm gonna have like a
6:41
ton of words right now tonight but I'm
6:44
hoping that I can get situated with
6:46
what's happening in act two because I
6:49
need to write 16 17 000 words this week
6:52
and I know that that's going to be a lot
6:54
more feasible for me if I've actually
6:57
written or worked out my plot according
7:01
to the Nano site starting today since we
7:04
have like 18 days left of Nano as I'm
7:06
recording this I need 1919 words per day
7:10
if I can get a thousand words today I
7:12
need 1970 words per day that's still
7:15
doable it's when we get deeper into the
7:17
month if I end up where I'm at a point
7:19
where I need like 3 000 words a day to
7:21
catch up that's when it gets hard but
7:23
right now I'm still in my manageable
7:24
Zone 2 000 words a day or less so I'm
7:27
hoping I can maintain that so we'll see
7:30
how it goes so I'm gonna get to work
7:32
[Music]
7:44
thank you
7:48
foreign
7:51
okay so I have spent a couple of Sprints
7:55
working on a I got a few little little
7:59
Post-its I got three Post-it notes up
8:01
there so some clarity I also like to
8:04
spend a little bit of time going through
8:07
photos on Pinterest trying to find
8:09
Visual representations of what is going
8:12
to happen in my story I put them up on
8:14
the board sometimes I'll put them in my
8:15
plotting planner and I'm just such a
8:17
visual person that that helps guide me
8:19
and keeps me like grounded and centered
8:22
on what's gonna happen next in the story
8:25
but I'm also realizing that act 2 is
8:31
going to take a bit more time I'm not
8:33
going to be able to just slap some
8:35
Post-it notes in a couple scenes because
8:37
this is really the part where I'm gonna
8:39
start weaving in the second timeline a
8:42
little bit more there's pieces of it in
8:43
the First Act but the second act is
8:45
really where the secrets start to come
8:47
out and it's really important for me to
8:49
understand whose Secrets come out when
8:51
and how they tie to the current timeline
8:53
so as much as I've been resisting the
8:56
thought I'm gonna need at least a day or
8:59
two full days to pull out that graph
9:02
paper work on the board and really focus
9:05
for like a few hours at a time as to how
9:08
these are going to get woven in and I'm
9:10
so resistant to taking the time
9:14
because if I get two more days behind
9:17
I'm going to be another 3 000 words
9:19
behind and I don't want to do that but I
9:22
also know from last year when I tried to
9:26
just power through and write anything
9:27
that I ended up throwing all those words
9:29
away and so this is a point where it's
9:31
kind of like I'm fighting my own process
9:33
and I am going to take a step back and
9:37
say you know what if I don't win Nano
9:39
but I actually have good words on the
9:42
page that is more of a win than having
9:44
50 000 words that are crap that I am
9:47
just gonna completely throw away like
9:49
sometimes we need to give ourselves
9:50
permission to write crappy words just so
9:53
we can start getting through the story
9:55
right there's a time for that but
9:59
everybody has their own individual
10:01
process and even if I'm writing crappy
10:04
words if they're if it's the right story
10:07
then it's worthwhile because I can edit
10:09
that but if I have to throw it all out
10:11
because none of those scenes are scenes
10:13
that are going to be in the final book
10:14
and I was just trying to push myself
10:16
through getting random words on the page
10:18
I don't think that's going to be as
10:20
helpful for me so really as I'm sitting
10:22
here thinking about it it's like okay I
10:24
would much rather have
10:26
30
10:27
000 really good quality words that are
10:30
gonna maybe still need to be edited of
10:32
course but actual like related to the
10:36
story and the scenes that belong in the
10:38
book rather than 50 000 words of
10:41
stuff I'm gonna throw away so I think
10:43
what I'm going to do tonight is I'm
10:45
going to write one of these scenes out
10:47
of order like maybe part of this
10:48
midpoint scene and just see if I can get
10:50
it on the page so that I don't have a
10:52
zero word day and then tomorrow it's a
10:55
super busy day but I do have a block of
10:57
writing time that's like three hours and
11:00
I think I'm gonna plan to spend that
11:01
time
11:02
brainstorming and working on these
11:04
secrets uh and just giving myself that
11:07
time and then maybe tomorrow night I'll
11:09
still be able to get some words in in
11:11
addition to the brainstorming and if I
11:13
can do that for a couple of days maybe
11:14
I'll be through the hump and I'll be
11:16
writing again so it's a little bit scary
11:20
because I know I'm way behind but I'm
11:22
gonna keep working and I'm gonna do what
11:24
I feel is right for my process so let's
11:27
get one good Sprint or two good Sprints
11:29
in it's already 10 30 at night so I'm
11:32
just gonna try to get a little bit done
11:34
I don't want to push myself too late
11:35
tonight because I need for tomorrow and
11:37
the rest of this week to be really good
11:39
so we'll see how Target
11:42
[Music]
12:02
okay just don't give up just don't give
12:05
up just don't give up
12:08
16
12:10
780 words
12:12
so out of order but I like them they're
12:16
gonna need a lot of editing but
12:18
I'm getting there I'm not giving up on
12:20
myself so let's take a look 16 780 in
12:24
the manuscript and over here in this uh
12:27
sidebar you can see I have all kinds of
12:30
crazy things I've got flashbacks that
12:32
don't fit in I've got a section that's
12:35
just brainstorming thoughts I have
12:38
um like some chapters I jump from
12:41
chapter four to chapter 9 10 11 12 and
12:44
then here I have chapter question mark
12:46
which is a flashback scene oh my gosh
12:50
it's it's a bit of a mess this is
12:52
probably one place where scrivener
12:54
really owns the day when it comes to
12:57
writing stuff and I wish that there was
12:59
a way in Google Docs that I could just
13:00
take this chapter and move it like you
13:02
can with scrivener but maybe someday
13:04
they'll create something that can be a
13:07
little bit better but either way 16 16 7
13:11
80.
13:13
is the word count that I'm at and so
13:15
when I go over I put that into Nano it
13:18
tells me that I have 13 30 words for the
13:21
day so I'm at 16 780 par today is 21 667
13:26
so I'm definitely still behind uh I'm
13:29
gonna need about you know a little bit
13:31
less than 2 000 words a day to catch up
13:34
but I feel like that's manageable I'm
13:37
going to like I said plan to take some
13:39
extra time tomorrow to plot so I have
13:42
all my sticky notes I have my graph
13:46
paper here and of course I have my big
13:49
plotting wall so I've got a big chunk of
13:52
time I'm meeting with Renee in the
13:53
morning but I've got a big chunk of time
13:55
in the afternoon before my business
13:57
meeting with accelerate and I'm hoping
13:59
that I can fill out most of this and I
14:03
also have this character sheets over
14:06
here I'm sorry it's so dark in here but
14:08
I have these character sheets over here
14:10
and what I'd like to do is write out
14:12
everybody's Secret and if I can get a
14:14
photo of what everybody kind of looks
14:16
like just like an actor or actress who
14:19
looks like them then I'm going to write
14:21
out everybody's Secrets have a visual
14:23
here and I'm gonna start weaving in how
14:25
those Secrets become a part of the main
14:28
timeline and if I can do that I think
14:30
I'm gonna be it's gonna push me forward
14:32
and make those 2 000 words a lot easier
14:34
but it might take me a few days to do it
14:36
and I've just got to get my mind
14:38
centered enough to make it happen but
14:41
you can kind of see here an example of
14:44
what I like to do with the visual so
14:47
you've got a scene with them in the
14:48
forest this is kind of an idea of what
14:51
maybe the cabin looks like this is the
14:53
cabin like front porch here's the
14:57
interior of the cabin and then here in
15:00
the second part it's going to be more of
15:02
the um some of the flashback type photos
15:05
but also some of the sort of murder
15:08
mystery stuff which you know you've got
15:11
the end of act one when when they head
15:14
into act two we start moving you know
15:16
into the new world which is basically
15:19
moving into what
15:21
is the promise of the premise as they
15:24
say or what we know is going to happen
15:27
here which is they're all gathered at
15:29
this cabin and now there's worries that
15:32
whoever hurt Vanessa or whatever
15:34
happened to Vanessa is now happening all
15:36
over again and that is basically what
15:39
you know what we're going to pull into
15:40
the second act so I'm excited to get
15:42
moving on it
15:44
a little nervous at how far behind I am
15:46
okay so that's a wrap for day 13. it's
15:49
been a long very busy day and I am out
15:53
of energy so I'm gonna go to bed and I
15:57
will see you all tomorrow all right good
15:59
night
16:00
bye

foreign
0:31
foreign
0:42
it is day 12 of nanowrimo I think
0:46
today's par to be on track is somewhere
0:50
around 20 000 words I am sitting at a
0:54
little over 14 000 so I'm around 6 000
0:57
words behind
0:59
if I don't hit the 6000 today so we're
1:03
we're a little bit more behind than I
1:05
wanted I have a zoom party for my
1:08
Spooktacular fans
1:10
um some of my book fans going on today I
1:12
have a master class I'm teaching
1:13
tomorrow and I'm realizing that I did a
1:16
very bad job of taking enough rest time
1:20
after this conference and sometimes I do
1:22
that it's like I plan for
1:25
like being at Max
1:28
capacity and I'm always reminding myself
1:31
that I need to take more breaks so
1:34
that's part of why I had a zero day
1:36
yesterday I just needed that bit of rest
1:37
so that I can get back to it today and I
1:40
think sometimes we have to just listen
1:42
to ourselves and to our bodies and our
1:44
minds and instead of beating ourselves
1:46
up over being behind we just say okay I
1:49
actually needed that rest there's
1:51
nothing wrong with me I'm not a bad
1:53
person I'm not failing I just needed
1:55
that rest and now I woke up today in
1:58
such a better mood Andrew's feeling
2:00
better so I think the antibiotics are
2:02
helping and I did finally get him that
2:04
cough medicine I had to go to Walmart
2:06
like 8 30 p.m last night to get it so I
2:09
was very happy to get that for him and
2:10
he's feeling a lot better Evie's feeling
2:12
fine I think everybody is on the mend
2:14
and healthy so the sun is shining today
2:17
it's absolutely beautiful out it's just
2:21
gorgeous blue skies but it is cold it's
2:24
like 37 degrees actually I don't know
2:27
what it is now but it was 30 37 degrees
2:28
when I woke up this morning but it's
2:31
beautiful so I want to go spend a little
2:32
bit of time on the egg chair not in
2:35
these shorts but I will probably put on
2:36
some comfy clothes and go hang out out
2:39
there later this afternoon I do have
2:42
some things to do before I can like read
2:44
or relax or uh do my writing so one is I
2:48
need to edit yesterday's Vlog that is
2:50
The Notebook challenge so you guys have
2:52
seen that by now and then I need to get
2:55
everything ready for this Zoom party so
2:57
probably that will take up most of the
2:59
afternoon but once that is over the
3:01
evening belongs to us as a family and I
3:04
spent a lot of good time with the kids
3:05
this morning several hours playing with
3:07
them and hanging out so now is my time
3:09
to get a little bit of work done but I'm
3:11
feeling the need to get back to routine
3:14
because I came home to a bit of a messy
3:18
house and I had things to clean I had a
3:21
lot of meetings this week I had a lot to
3:23
do my assistant was out and so it was
3:26
just I fail able to get back to my
3:29
normal routine and I always crave it
3:32
that's like a feeling deep inside that
3:34
I'm like okay I need to get back to
3:36
routine I need to like get my planning
3:38
so that I can get my mind straight about
3:39
what I want to be doing so I can be
3:41
intentional with my time and it's one of
3:44
my like core values is being intentional
3:47
with my time because when I don't get
3:49
intentional with my time and decide how
3:52
I want to spend my day like being
3:54
restful can be an intention right but
3:56
what I don't want to do is waste time on
4:00
things that really aren't truly
4:01
important to me and not get the rest
4:04
that I needed so I want to rest
4:05
intentionally I want to work
4:07
intentionally and I don't want to
4:08
sacrifice things unintentionally which
4:11
was part of what I was speaking about at
4:12
Ram
4:13
so getting back to being intentional
4:17
about my time setting up my routines is
4:19
super important so I was kind of
4:20
cleaning up the bathroom and some of
4:22
those other spaces getting back into the
4:24
habit of making my bed
4:26
um I want to
4:28
really start thinking about everything
4:31
that's coming up here with another round
4:33
of hb90 and the reboot of publish and
4:37
Thrive and I've got a long-term planning
4:39
kind of like mini course coming up so I
4:41
want to get my head around like when I'm
4:43
gonna do that work and then I also of
4:45
course want to be doing my writing so
4:47
I'm going to go upstairs and I'm going
4:50
to finish up the edits do my zoom call
4:53
and then I will check back in with you
4:54
guys this afternoon for hopefully some
4:57
reading and writing and planning and
4:59
getting myself back on track with my
5:00
routine
5:03
[Music]
5:09
[Music]
5:16
thank you
5:24
[Music]
5:40
foreign
5:42
[Music]
6:02
hey guys so we've just finished dinner
6:05
this is not Pepsi this is tea we had
6:09
dinner delivered which is nice to do
6:12
every once in a while
6:13
especially on the weekends and
6:16
now sorry it's so dark in here now I'm
6:20
going to try to get a little bit of
6:22
writing in while George fills up the tub
6:25
so today has been one of those busy busy
6:30
days even though it's Saturday like I
6:31
did actually like I said take the
6:34
morning with the kids but since then I
6:37
had that Zoom call I was working on a
6:39
presentation I'm doing tomorrow uh I got
6:42
the notebook challenge video up which
6:44
took like two hours to upload with my
6:47
internet which is crazy
6:49
um but it's just been a super busy day
6:51
and I ever since I filled you guys in
6:54
earlier I haven't had even a minute to
6:56
think and George really wanted to do
6:59
some Minecraft together tonight and he
7:02
wanted to watch some Hunter x Hunter
7:03
which is the anime that we're currently
7:06
watching and I feel like it's a Saturday
7:08
night I want to be able to spend that
7:10
time with my husband but this is where
7:14
the realization and reality comes in as
7:18
to why I have not had as much success
7:20
getting my writing done over the past
7:22
year or so because there's just too much
7:26
and so it kind of has me feeling a
7:30
little bit anxious of like okay I really
7:33
do need to make some changes in my life
7:35
in terms of how much I'm doing and where
7:38
I'm spending my time and energy and what
7:42
my priorities are so I'm gonna be
7:44
thinking about that but right now I need
7:47
to just be writing so I don't still have
7:51
a lot of the Act 2 stuff in terms of
7:54
what's up on the board or in terms of
7:57
index cards but I showed you guys
7:59
yesterday in my plotting planner that I
8:03
did actually have some of this act two
8:07
part
8:08
filled out on this part so
8:13
I think that what I'm gonna do is I'm
8:16
just going to write what I think might
8:19
be one of those scenes and for me it's
8:23
it's such a struggle because I there's
8:26
some part of me intuitively that is like
8:28
I need to know some more of these twists
8:31
before I'm ready to start writing
8:32
everything but then when you're trying
8:34
to write to a deadline sometimes you
8:35
have to just push through and try to get
8:37
words on the page but then I'm like I
8:39
don't want to get words on the page that
8:41
aren't going to be good words and so
8:43
then I tend to hold myself back and
8:44
don't write it all so I'm trying to
8:48
overcome that perfectionist tendency to
8:51
like it has to be great and instead open
8:54
up my mind to the fact of like maybe
8:56
something surprising and exciting will
8:58
be discovered if I just sit down and
9:00
write and so what I'm going to do is I'm
9:04
actually going to sit down right now I
9:08
just turned on my laptop make sure I
9:10
have the right nanowrimo
9:13
um
9:14
folder or file up and I'm just going to
9:18
turn on a 20 minute timer so what we're
9:21
doing right now is kind of tag teaming
9:23
George is filling up the tub and he's
9:25
going to get Evie into the tub and then
9:27
I'm going to finish up and I'm going to
9:28
read her a book and then he reads her
9:30
book and puts her down for night time
9:33
like we kind of tag team this a lot
9:35
usually it's me doing all of the bath
9:37
stuff but he's going to take over the
9:39
beginning of it and then I will swoop in
9:41
read a book then he'll swoop in and get
9:43
her to bed and that should give me time
9:45
to do two writing Sprints and I'm hoping
9:48
that I can get at least a thousand words
9:50
I am at this point about going to be 6
9:52
000 words behind and so I don't want to
9:55
have a zero day so let's go let's do a
9:59
little bit of writing
9:59
[Applause]
10:00
[Music]
10:12
[Applause]
10:28
thank you
10:30
okay so I did one 15-minute Sprint went
10:34
upstairs got Evie out of the bath got
10:36
her to bed and then I came back down and
10:39
did another 30 minute Sprint and I am at
10:41
15
10:42
450 words so let me calculate how many
10:46
that is today
10:47
so here's my word count 15 450 and when
10:50
I put that into Nano it says that I did
10:53
1270 and it says I need 18.85 so if
10:57
you're actually using the nanowrimo
11:00
website once you update your words for
11:03
the day you know like when I get in here
11:05
tomorrow it's going to tell me how much
11:06
I need to get per day in order to kind
11:09
of catch up and still hit the 50k so I
11:11
do like that about the Nano site so I'm
11:14
at 1270 for the day and I always love it
11:18
when it's like these
11:19
perfect numbers with the 450 or the 1270
11:23
with no like extra numbers there at the
11:26
end the zeros at the end so
11:29
still not a catch-up day but I'm on the
11:33
board and I'm celebrating the heck out
11:35
of that so this 15K plus the six to
11:38
seven thousand that I had before I
11:39
started the month puts me over 20k for
11:42
this manuscript which is very very
11:44
exciting but I'm still at 15 so I'm
11:46
halfway to my 20K reward and feeling
11:49
pretty good
11:51
so tomorrow is Sunday and tomorrow I am
11:55
hoping like fingers crossed that I'm
11:57
gonna have more time to work on this I
12:00
also have a lot of flashbacks in the
12:02
alternate timeline that I need to figure
12:04
out where they go and I need to figure
12:06
out what all scenes I need because each
12:08
of the main characters in this series
12:10
has a secret and that secret comes out
12:14
in the current day timeline and then
12:16
that leads to a flashback of something
12:19
that happened you know before the summer
12:21
that Vanessa disappeared so
12:25
it's all it's all there and I I know
12:28
that I'm gonna get to it I know I'm
12:30
gonna get to it but I just am anxious to
12:32
get it all on the board and kind of see
12:34
it because when I can visualize it
12:36
that's gonna be super helpful for me so
12:39
I just need and I'm longing for a day or
12:41
two days that I can spend more than just
12:44
30 minutes or you know 20 minutes here
12:46
and there I need like a full day or two
12:48
to just sit and think about the plot in
12:51
addition to my writing so I'm working on
12:53
getting there tomorrow for my publish
12:55
and Thrive self-publishing class I'm
12:57
doing a master class just because
13:00
even though the course is like six weeks
13:02
of good information you just can't cover
13:04
everything that you would need to know
13:06
about self-publishing so in such a short
13:08
time period so I'm also doing these free
13:11
master classes and tomorrow we're
13:13
talking about social media marketing so
13:15
I need to finish putting together my
13:16
slides and stuff for that tomorrow
13:19
um I'm imagining that I also and then
13:22
it's Sunday so I also need to get all my
13:25
planning done and everything else so
13:27
yeah and my heart this time of year is
13:31
always like my brain I guess I should
13:33
say but like I'm always feeling pulled
13:35
toward what's 2023 gonna be like what
13:38
are you gonna do next year what's your
13:39
word of the year what planners are you
13:41
using and all those kind of thoughts
13:43
that are going through my head so I'm
13:44
trying so hard to resist them I'm trying
13:46
hard to resist pulling out all the
13:48
planners I've bought so far and really
13:50
thinking through my system I'm not gonna
13:52
do it not tonight I'm gonna go enjoy
13:54
some time with my husband
13:57
um and we're gonna watch some TV we're
13:59
gonna play some Minecraft We're gonna
14:00
hang out I'm going to check on Andrew
14:01
make sure he's still feeling better he
14:03
seems to be massively improved so I
14:05
think the antibiotics were a good call
14:07
for him and we're going to get some good
14:10
sleep and you know I am always searching
14:13
for that level of balance and so if you
14:17
also have been like not quite hitting
14:19
goal and you're behind a little bit like
14:21
I am but you're choosing time with your
14:25
family or time doing something else
14:27
that's important to you don't beat
14:28
yourself up if you're a little bit
14:30
behind as long as you continue to make
14:32
progress it's okay to choose some of
14:35
those other things because the the truth
14:37
is I'm not going to look back five years
14:39
from now and remember whether I'm hit
14:41
Nano and whether this book came out in
14:43
December or January or February like
14:45
that's not really going to be what makes
14:47
a difference but I will remember that we
14:49
sat down as a family and we played these
14:51
video games and we had some fun and like
14:53
eating popcorn with my hubby and like I
14:56
will remember those bonds that we
14:57
created because they'll still be there
14:59
and we'll will be nurturing that
15:01
relationship with each other and that is
15:03
important too so we do the best we can
15:06
and then we keep marching forward so
15:08
tomorrow it's going to be a busy day but
15:12
I'm hoping that at least in my plan it
15:14
might be another sort of short word
15:16
count day but in my plan I'm hoping next
15:18
week is going to be my big catch-up week
15:21
so I'm excited to start planning
15:23
tomorrow all right that's it for today
15:25
and I will see you guys on day 13.
15:29
I hope your writing is going great and I
15:31
hope you're enjoying these Vlogs and I
15:33
will see you next time bye
15:38
[Music]
15:41
oh God it's a creeper
15:44
[Music]
15:48
oh my God
16:00
[Music]
16:23
foreign
hey everybody welcome back it is day 11 of nanowrimo it's also Veterans Day here
0:09
in the United States so if you are a veteran or you are in a veteran family thank you so much for your service and
0:15
all you do for this country thank you so much it has been a cold day here in Dallas so even though I'm wearing my
0:21
shorts that are part of my uniform I'm also wearing fuzzy socks and I have been putting on some hoodie here and there
0:27
but I figured today is a good day to do our notebook Challenge and we're going to talk just a little bit not only about
0:33
the notebooks which I kind of have stacked up over here on my desk but also about
0:39
the feeling of having too many things of having so much Choice when it comes to
0:47
my free time that sometimes it feels debilitating in terms of trying to actually enjoy myself so we're going to
0:53
talk a little bit about these things and hopefully it's going to be a good kind of November notebook challenge cozy day
1:00
so let's talk about all the notebooks that I've been using
1:06
[Music]
1:12
[Music]
1:27
okay you guys so this is the November notebook Challenge and I was thinking oh my gosh do I even have anything to
1:34
update because I have all these lovely notebooks and this is like the
1:40
manifesting notebook that I use and I made this one to do like a dream life
1:45
budget but other than that the last time I wrote in this was September 18th it's
1:51
still sitting on my side table but October was
1:57
ridiculously busy and although I was joyful and happy about all the things I was doing I did not have time for a lot
2:04
of my notebooks and you know it's not really a problem it's just there are gonna sometimes be busier
2:11
times in our lives where we aren't able to necessarily keep up with some of these like extras for me a lot of my
2:18
notebooks are functional and I use them a lot for planning and then some of my notebooks
2:26
are more I don't want to say Superfluous but just things that are like luxuries when you're super busy or when the kids
2:32
are sick or when it's like I don't I just don't always have time for them but
2:39
I was thinking quite a bit lately about having too much on my plate and trying
2:47
to find that good balance and I I feel like this could be a whole other video
2:54
that maybe I'll go into a little bit more in depth sometime later in nanowrimo Diaries when
3:00
I can just sit down and talk about it but I feel like I am always coming up against this
3:08
desire to like serve people more to find more success to help people more and I
3:14
want to do that I have so many other ideas for courses a lot of people said they would love to have a course on
3:20
actually writing a novel finishing your novel and there's so much more I want to add to the publish and Thrive course and
3:25
I'm going to be redoing that and it's like I have no shortage of ideas and on top of all that I do still want to be
3:32
writing and spending time with my fans and keeping up with my social media and
3:38
in a lot of ways I Am Naturally the type of person who enjoys being busy and
3:43
having lots of projects and so I don't burn out easily just because I have a lot to do when I start to burn out it's
3:50
because of the emotional sides of things where either I'm just working too hard and not getting the results I want or
3:57
there's trauma coming up that I haven't fully healed and I don't give myself the
4:02
time but I'm naturally somebody who has a lot of stamina to work many hours and
4:08
I really enjoy working a lot and having a system like hb90 has allowed me to
4:14
actually like only work a lot of days only like four hours a day five hours a day and still get a lot done and be able
4:21
to balance family and stuff like that but you guys know if you've been around for a while that my writing tends to be
4:27
something that gets put on the back burner not because I don't have time for my writing but because I don't have time
4:33
for the thinking that goes into coming up with the plots and what I'm going to
4:39
write so I'm already thinking about changes that I want to make to my schedule in
4:44
2023 but it's hard because there's more projects and more growth that I want to focus on too so this is something I've
4:52
been thinking about and it does relate to my notebooks so let me clear this off
4:58
and let me talk about why that relates to my notebooks part of the reason this has been on my mind when it comes to my
5:04
notebooks is when I've been busy over the past say month and a half
5:10
my life has been a lot busier because I have a lot more on my plate during October with my spectacular and the
5:16
preptober stuff and then here in November with the daily Vlogs and things like that
5:21
and I have not had time sorry if I shook the table I have not had time to get
5:29
into my notebooks and that makes me feel sad because my notebooks is self-care
5:35
time for me it's like reflection time it's like I give give this is time to like give back to myself and kind of go
5:42
Inward and really start thinking but when I get busy sometimes these are the kinds of things that goes by the wayside
5:49
I have for example this manifesting journal I started it in May but I that's months right and I've only gotten this
5:56
far and I haven't written in this notebook since September because I just
6:02
haven't had time then I also have for example this one so this is actually a
6:08
planner it's a hobonichi just the A6 hobonichi and I didn't use it at the beginning of
6:13
the year and then sometime in like April I decided that I was going to use it for a like a gratitude kind of Journal like
6:21
nothing but positive stuff and I did use it for about a week and then I didn't
6:27
use it anymore so I would love to be able to use this I have a desire to fill this all the way up and have it be thick
6:33
and beautiful and pretty but I haven't had time then I have my
6:39
story Journal which you guys saw me set up and I have so much passion for wanting to be consuming stories and
6:46
filling this up as well but as you can see I have not had a lot of time to
6:52
touch it so I don't have any books that I've finished reading that are going to go on
6:58
this list um well I do have I do actually have a couple of books but one of them is non-fiction one of them is fiction but
7:05
it's like I don't have like this whole spread filled out I had all these ideas for the Quarry that I wanted to put in
7:10
here we did finish watching death note and I didn't get a chance to finish that I did set this up because we're watching
7:16
Hunter x Hunter so I do want to fill that out too but otherwise I haven't had time to do this
7:22
and in a lot of ways part of that is because this doesn't earn me money this
7:29
doesn't have anything to do with the time I spend with my family this doesn't have to do with anybody but me and so
7:36
often when I'm you know in a busy season of my life my
7:44
stuff is the first to go you know the time that I need because it's like if I'm working working working and then I
7:50
get off work the family needs me and I want to spend time with my kids so I have that kind of balance that I've
7:56
gained in my life where I have work family balance but then it's either give
8:02
up my sleep which I don't want to do or give up some of the time that I would spend like gaming or watching TV or
8:10
playing in my notebooks and so I've been really thinking a lot about
8:15
what is 2023 look like for me because I want to be able to sustain my income I
8:21
want to be able to continue to grow my you know YouTube channel but I want to be writing I want to be watching my kids
8:28
grow up and and being there for them and I want to be exploring some of these
8:34
things that are not for YouTube or things that are just for me or some of my journaling but I think in
8:40
a lot of ways I have too many things going all at once and this is not an
8:46
invitation for judgment it's just we're all in a process right and sometimes
8:52
even though I have a lot of things and I enjoy them sometimes I find that if I have
8:57
just one hour a night and I have 10 different notebooks that I could
9:03
potentially be filling up I just don't have time to do any of them and what happens is when that hour arrives I have
9:10
so many possibilities of what I could do I could game I could read I could watch TV I could you know there's there's 20
9:16
things I want to do and they all have a corresponding notebook that I would love to fill out that I get paralyzed and I
9:23
think it's only an hour what can I do in an hour nothing and then I end up either scrolling social media which I don't
9:30
want to be doing just sitting around doing nothing which
9:35
I also don't want to be doing or doing like a one episode of a TV show that I don't
9:41
get back to for three weeks so one of the things that I'm thinking of for 2023 well one is I would like to cut
9:50
back on a few of my obligations and responsibilities so I have a few things
9:55
coming up early in the year but after that I would love to kind of scale back
10:01
so like I might only be running publish and Thrive one time next year instead of twice which is hard for me to say
10:07
because I love that course and I know there are going to be people that need it twice but it's like I have to create
10:12
space in my life for other things um and I can't work myself too hard I'm
10:18
naturally like I said somebody who likes to work a lot and if you are familiar with Becca's time she talks about this
10:24
being like a phoenix that you Phoenix people are people who work work work work work
10:30
and then when the task is done they rest but they're not people that like work work rest work rest work rest and stay
10:36
balanced they're just people who naturally like to go go go go go and they are capable of like you know hard
10:42
work over a sustained period of time and then when the task is done they rest and rejuvenate and then they go go again and
10:48
that is the kind of person I am so don't compare yourself to me we are all different and it's okay
10:54
um because I don't want anyone to judge me either which I have gotten some of that on this channel about like you're
10:59
you're working too hard you're doing too much and it's like just trust that I'm on my own journey and I'm doing the best
11:05
I can but on my journey I'm definitely noticing that I have
11:11
regrets about not having time to properly fill these notebooks and I feel like it's
11:18
partially tied to having too many things too many notebooks on the go too many
11:24
ideas too many things I'm trying to complete and some of the joy in using a notebook like this story journal for
11:30
example is going to come from actually filling it out and finishing it up not
11:36
just setting it up and not touching it for six months so I think I have some soul searching and some a lot of
11:43
thinking to do about how to do less work overall throughout the year take on less
11:48
projects create more space and time for free time and for Sarah time
11:54
and then also having less Choice when it comes to the hour I have every night
12:00
like instead of saying well I could do this this or this maybe saying to myself I'm gonna watch all of Hunter x Hunter
12:07
and I'm gonna fill out this notebook and that's what I'm gonna do until it's done and just dedicating all of my time to
12:14
that and you know if I want to have a gratitude and a manifesting and whatever
12:19
then it all just goes into one notebook and I put my gratitude my manifesting all into this one thing instead of
12:26
having three or four different notebooks that do that and I'm kind of feeling drawn to that right now so let me know if that
12:33
resonates with you I know that's kind of a long explanation but none of these have anything new to show
12:39
I have some notebooks also by the way if you're new and you're like what is The Notebook challenge because you've just
12:45
discovered me this preptober or anything like that I should have already mentioned the notebook challenge is just a monthly thing we've been doing since
12:51
like 2019 where I challenge you to actually use some of the notebooks that
12:57
you have been hoarding because as writers we like to like ah my precious and we don't want to actually use them
13:04
because we're scared we're going to mess them up or what we're writing them is not special enough or whatever so I just
13:10
encourage you to use them but I'm also going to encourage you to think about how you're using the notebooks and
13:17
whether it's making you feel regret which is kind what I'm kind of feeling right now is like regret and pressure
13:23
from having too many things on the go or if it's supporting you um but the notebook challenge in and of
13:29
itself is not about velocity like how fast you're using up your notebooks but rather just that you're using them in
13:34
ways that make you happy and bring you Joy so come join us there's no no like way to enter you just come join us and
13:41
we do a giveaway every month so I have this Erin Condren three subject notebook
13:46
that I have been working in pretty steadily and it's just my weekly meetings with Renee in the first subject
13:52
and then the second subject is not I don't have as much in here but it's just
13:57
kind of like my thoughts and then this third part is like my weekly accelerate
14:03
meetings and other like energy leadership and other types of meetings so this one is slowly getting filled out
14:08
but as you can see there's no real like prettiness to this it's just notes but I have enjoyed this A5 size for the three
14:17
subject notebook so I really like this one another one that I have been actively
14:23
using is my B6 stalagy so you can see it's getting nice it's got a hair in it
14:30
come out it's getting nice and chunky as you can see and I'm loving it so I can't
14:38
wait to fill this one out so you I still have this much left of it and even if I
14:43
don't completely finish it I might finish it off like wherever I am December 31st I'm gonna be done with it
14:50
because I've got something different I want to use for my six months for Life notebook for next year but I have been
14:57
really enjoying this notebook and it has
15:02
been fun to track my habits now I fell off the wagon oh and look at this I wrote December on this and I'm just now
15:08
seeing that I bet I wrote it over here too I did I wrote December this is where this is how busy I am this
15:15
is where my brain is we are in the month of November not December so I need to cover that with a sticker but I also
15:20
because of romance author Mastermind did not have a chance to fill this out but every other month I have stuck with this
15:27
and this is the most I have ever stuck with a habit tracker my whole life and
15:33
I'm really proud of that I'm grateful that I have been able to stick with it that one I didn't put a
15:40
tab on but I've been keeping up with it since July and I've been enjoying it and
15:46
then in between the Habit tracker I've just been doing some journaling and putting tip-ins in and I just really
15:54
like it sometimes I'll do tarot reading sometimes I put like this is from the
15:59
digital dash box from planner press and I just printed it out and glued it in
16:04
here because I thought it was cute and I did the same thing last month with some of her designs that come in B6 size and
16:11
I just thought those were super cute so I have loved having this so this is a journal a daily habit tracker and really
16:17
thinking more about how I want to change my life so there's no like business stuff or career goals in here this is
16:24
really just about my own personal development and I have loved it now I originally started with this inside a
16:29
traveler's notebook and I thought I would fill out all the other notebooks but like every time I try to use a
16:35
traveler's notebook style I always just end up pulling the notebook out and using it individually so maybe I should
16:40
just be done with trying to use traveler's notebooks I'm not sure but I have been using this one and I do enjoy
16:47
it I thought I would also share with you since we are in the middle of nanowrimo
16:52
my actual plotting notebook and how I have it set up right now so I have this really cute I think this came from Glam
16:59
girl planners but this was more Halloween themed but since I write witchy stuff anyway I'm going to leave
17:04
it on for ever but I have some of the little supplies that I need like page flags and stickers
17:11
and things like that in the front then I do have some uh plot stuff here and
17:17
everything basically in this front section is about The Disappearance of
17:24
Vanessa Shaw so I was kind of creating an extra like blank plotting
17:30
page to start with but I haven't actually used this I've been putting it up on the board there
17:36
but I also have some just kind of blank pages and then I have the preptober workbook here that you guys could get
17:44
for free I know several of you have used it and I did use it to kind of plan out my own word counts and stuff like that
17:50
but I'm also keeping track of this sort of game board version and so I've been keeping track of my days sadly I'm about
17:57
to fall to a zero day here which is going to be I'm going to be at 14
18:03
000. 180 words and I need to have eighteen thousand so
18:10
I'm 4 200 words behind that is a little bit scary but we're
18:17
still in the first half of the month so I'm not going to stress it too much I'm going to hope that I can catch up and
18:22
even if I can't I'm making progress and that is great because I also have seven thousand words that I wrote before the
18:28
month began so I'm I'm moving forward as long as I can keep going slow and steady
18:33
even if I only got 500 Words a day I'm happy but I've been coloring in as I hit
18:38
the whole number so like even though I'm a little bit into 14 to 15 000 I'm not
18:44
filling in the 15K until the number says 15K so I have that filled in here and
18:50
then I have just my notes from the preptober workbook I've been keeping track as best I can with the word
18:55
Sprints that I have although when I was out of town I did not have this notebook with me so I've just been kind of just
19:01
filling it in with the daily totals and then I also have this pixel tracker
19:07
that's in the preptober workbook that has the pixels so once all this is filled out each box represents 100 Words
19:14
and one this is filled out that'll be the full fifty thousand then I also have my rewards here I've
19:22
already gotten my ten thousand reward so I'm on my way to the twenty thousand close to halfway there and then last
19:30
week I did fill out my meal plan and then I have
19:35
this week is blank so I did not get a chance to do this and I have regretted not having the time to do it so I'm
19:42
definitely going to sit down this weekend and plan out my meals and when I plan to write for next week because I think there's no way I'm going to be
19:48
catching up with my word count unless I get a chance to fill these things out so
19:54
I've got that meal planner and stuff in here as well then in the main part you
20:00
can see I have this word tracker that I had started before the beginning of the month and instead of adding on to this I
20:07
used I'm using the one that's just for nanowrimo so I'll probably pull this sheet out but I had already taped it on
20:13
to the other pages so I have basically a lot of this filled out so
20:19
when I go to fill out my plotting wall tomorrow I do have parts of Act 2
20:25
figured out and this this midpoint oh my gosh I'm very excited for this midpoint
20:31
but I do not I do not have act two the second half figured out so I've got work
20:38
to do there and then this is the plotting page so
20:44
this is Created from a happy planner and then I just covered it up so that I
20:50
could do this and if you don't know Adrian from procrasta planner has some like act one and such stickers that
20:56
she's created I think they're up on her shop and so I'm going to start using those from now on instead of just
21:01
writing it in but I have notes Here on my characters on their story arcs on the
21:07
secrets because everybody here has a secret any of the brainstorming and other things that I've been doing are
21:13
all in here and then later in this planner I have all my notes for book 12.
21:19
so I've got both books in here because I've been actively working on both but I thought I would just give you that heads
21:25
up and what's really cool about using basically I call it happy planner
21:31
but you can create your own disk notebook so when you're using something
21:36
like this it's called a coil when you have the like six ring A5 binder that
21:43
like opens that's just called like A5 rings but these are called discs and you can
21:50
buy the discs separately they don't have to be from Happy planner you can get them at Office Depot or Staples from
21:56
different brands these that are dragonfly discs I got from a place called Inc United on Etsy and I love
22:03
them I have them in purple and thank you again to a dear subscriber who sent me these in the first place in
22:09
red which I'm going to be using those again coming up but I just love them so much dragonflies but
22:15
you can basically create your own notebooks as many as you want forever for the rest
22:21
of your life if you have a hole punch that will punch for these discs and you
22:27
can make them in this classic size or you can make them in the big eight and a half by eleven size but as long as you
22:32
have the hole punch you can basically just have the discs you can either create your own cover or buy one like
22:38
this one I bought on Etsy because it's really thick plastic my laminator will only do the like three mil or something
22:45
so it doesn't make I can't do plastic this heavy so I just like to buy it it's
22:50
like ten dollars and just paper so a lot of this paper that
22:56
you guys see here this is just my normal paper that I use
23:02
and I just bought on Etsy dot grid printable paper like a PDF that's dot
23:08
grid and it came in like gray and purple and blue and whatever dots and so I just
23:13
take regular paper I print the dots on it I hole punch it and then I create my notebook like you don't need to even buy
23:19
a happy planner to create your own notebook and that's one of the things that I love about this style of notebook and then you can take it out you can
23:25
play around with it you can do lots with it and just to show you some examples of
23:31
that this is some old happy planner discs but this is all paper that was
23:36
just my own paper and this is the eight and a half by eleven size then I have this one as well that I
23:44
created as my gaming notebook and again this was another attempt of
23:49
mine to create a notebook that I could track how much time I'm spending gaming
23:56
and then I just haven't had the time to dedicate so I think I just need to make some decisions about how I'm going to
24:02
create that time to read more to um to game more to spend more time with
24:08
my husband and my family without working quite as much in 2023 so I'm still kind of searching for that balance but my
24:15
goal with this was to put like this is a monthly planner page and to have the weekly planner Pages you can see I
24:22
decorated one of them but I didn't actually fill it out where I would get a chance to say like any little like fun
24:31
thing that we did or game that we played or if the kids played outside kind of like a little memory keeping thing but
24:36
part of my problem is I can't I don't have time in my life right now to memory keep inside this happy planner and in my
24:44
Erin Condren 7x9 vertical planner and to be keeping track of some memories also
24:49
in my A5 binder or in something that I'm going to put photos in it's like I need to simplify just because I want to be
24:56
able to use a happy planner and an Erin Condren and whatever because I like the buying of it and I like it when I see
25:03
someone else using it I need to just say okay where am I putting my memories like if I want to do memory keeping it goes
25:09
in this one planner and when am I going to actually fill it out okay every Sunday afternoon at 5 PM then that's
25:15
what I'm going to do so I think I just need more organization around that stuff because I started this notebook and then
25:22
I feel sad every time I look at it that I haven't used it but basically inside this notebook there
25:28
is a lot of stuff with my gaming like when I start a character and yes I have a character named after characters in my
25:34
books whenever she would get a level I would put you know color it in but as
25:40
you can see I only made it to like level 10 out of 50 or something and then
25:45
didn't didn't complete it and I just need to focus myself in on where I'm
25:50
actually going to spend my time in the future here's one that got to 112 So Close to 125 but I would print out like
25:59
if I had any game guides or anything like that I would print them out and then just um just go through and
26:06
hole punch it so there's a lot of options as to what you can do with a
26:12
hole punch and some happy planner discs now this cover I made myself um so you can see it's not quite as it's
26:19
a little more bendy but it's still cute so I don't know I I want to continue to
26:26
increase my joy and still just be able to do lots of things so I thought since
26:32
I found this in my stash like in my notebook stash that I would also show you a quick example of now this one I
26:39
obviously took the covers off of and this is just like an old notebook but when I'm going through my edits this is
26:45
what my plotting notebook will look like where I have color coded in each scene
26:52
of each character so this would be act one and I have each scene kind of detailed out
26:57
and I moved the rest of it because I didn't want spoilers here but I would have one page per scene or per act and
27:05
then I also had on here inside this notebook
27:12
each point of view character so I have four points of view character in this novel and so I would have each character
27:18
has their own trajectory of what scenes they have in each act so that as I'm going through
27:23
and I'm editing I have a complete list of what each character is going through and I make sure that their individual
27:30
Journey makes a lot of sense so just to show you as an example what that looked like for me
27:36
um it's kind of kind of nice and then of course I also had uh like well this is a
27:43
different book so this or actually this is the same book but this is uh
27:48
different stages of the process so this is when I was still plotting when I was writing and this one that's nicer and
27:54
neater in the front is when the book was done and I was working on my edits but I also would do like brainstorming pages
28:01
in here and then I also had um just different notes and stuff here
28:06
and then I also had things in here for productivity about like ideas for my ideal day and how I wanted to track my
28:13
time and what my work hours were going to be so lots of different things in one notebook but but I thought you guys
28:18
might like to see that example of the scenes here just because it's something
28:24
I don't think I've shown before so another place where I've considered
28:29
simplifying in terms of notebooks slash oh my gosh if I
28:35
so this whole video might just be off to the side which I'm realizing I should have probably had my stuff over here so
28:40
I apologize um but I have these monthly notebooks from Erin Condren and I really have used
28:47
this a lot and it has been something that I have used
28:53
um pretty much on a weekly basis and this one is for Sarah Cannon this one is for
29:00
heart breathings and like a lot of my like preptober videos get outlined in
29:05
here all of my outlines and stuff going here and I was thinking for a while about like if I wanted to simplify how
29:11
many planners I was using maybe I could just have one monthly calendar that's for my editorial
29:18
um inside my A5 binder and then instead of using two separate notebooks for outlines I could just use like a
29:24
Goodreads notebook inside my iPad um but I already have purchased my
29:31
monthly planners for next year so I have some thinking to do about whether I want to try to switch up my system or if I
29:39
want to simplify in other places but I am kind of feeling like maybe right now I have too many things on the go and
29:46
though that has served me well in the past we all evolve and adapt and change another thing that I have kind of
29:53
changed about my systems so far this year is instead of using this hourly planner for social media which I was
30:00
doing for a while I have switched it to a Time tracking planner and I've been just using these planner Kate weekly
30:08
Samplers these are only like two dollars and fifty cents or three dollars or something like that and you can really
30:14
decorate quite nicely with just this one thing instead of using like a full 20 kit and this has been really nice for me
30:22
to have a separate planner where I track my time but again
30:27
I it's hard to be consistent with it because I have too many planners like
30:32
I'm pulling out this one and then I'm pulling out this one and then I have to put them back and it starts to get messy and then I have to spend time cleaning
30:38
things up so I don't really know what my plan is going to be for 2023 but I will have a planner lineup figured out by
30:45
early December and I will share that with you guys but um otherwise I haven't really been using
30:50
any new notebooks I have this one little Travelers notebook that I think I maybe
30:56
showed you guys last time where I was kind of keeping track of where I was in a game and how much time
31:02
I was spending in my games and again then I didn't have time to game over the
31:08
last month so I know you can see a pattern here but let me know your thoughts
31:13
how many notebooks planners and things do you have on the go and do you sometimes feel like you have so much that you have a hard time decision like
31:20
making a decision about where you want to spend your time and
31:25
if so do you think it would help you to simplify I'm trying to make a decision but in the
31:31
comments please try not to be judgmental about how much stuff I use because that's really not helpful but instead
31:37
maybe give suggestions about how I could simplify or how I could combine things that would be super helpful and I would
31:43
certainly appreciate it because I'm open to possibilities but the thought of using less stuff also makes me sad so I
31:49
think I have to like manage my expectations for next year we do have a giveaway going though so let's enter to
31:57
win you've got two choices of notebooks so one winner will win and you get to
32:02
choose which one you want so I have an Erin Condren notebook that is this
32:08
floral design and it says we Rise by lifting others and it does have all these pretty floral designs on the top
32:15
and then the second choice is this punctuate journal from I got this from
32:21
Barnes and Noble and it has this sort of Tribal Design to it lovely purple
32:26
interior and the lines inside are like an olive green and so this is just a lined Journal that is like basically
32:33
classic happy planner size I believe like a little bit bigger than an Erin Condren notebook and it has a ribbon and
32:41
it has a elastic band closure and then it also does have a pocket here in the
32:46
back and this is like a coated paper um cover so
32:54
all you have to do to enter to win is just comment down below make sure you're subscribed and make sure that you like
32:59
this video and I do not have a new diverse read for the month to share with
33:05
you guys I haven't had time to really go searching for a lovely new book so first
33:10
of all if you are an author in our community and you'd like to be featured on a notebook challenge video please email me and let me know about your
33:17
books especially if you've taken publish and Thrive or if you have been part of this community and you've recently
33:23
started publishing your own books or they are published by a traditional publisher I would love to feature you
33:29
also if you can just leave a comment down below and let me know what you've been reading lately and we will get back
33:35
on the diverse reads train for the month of December for sure but that is the
33:41
monthly notebook challenge okay so those are my thoughts about notebooks those are the notebooks that I'm using right
33:47
now let me know if you kind of feel the same way and what your solution has been if you have one I think I also really
33:54
just as a side note want to work on organizing my things better because I my
34:00
notebook closet right now I'll show it to you again real quick is super messy
34:07
and I think having my notebooks more organized my supplies more organized is really going to help but I also think
34:12
having less will help but that's hard because it's part of my self-care is the
34:17
shopping and the buying of things but also I just need to chill with it so I
34:22
don't know exactly what my solution is yet I need to start thinking about it but sadly today is likely to be a no
34:30
writing day I did not get time to work on my Act 2 stuff tomorrow is Saturday I
34:36
have a few events going on over the weekend but the kids seem to be on the mend Andrew's feeling much better today
34:42
so I'm hoping that means that antibiotics are working Evie seems to be fine and in normal spirits today and I
34:48
got a pretty good night's sleep last night so I'm hoping even though this is going to be another zero day for me I'm
34:55
hoping to wake up tomorrow feeling excited and refreshed and ready to work on act two and then once I get some of
35:03
that plotted hopefully I can start catching up I have had a few days here and there that have been you know two
35:09
thousand three thousand four thousand more days so I need a few more of those to catch up because I'm starting to fall
35:15
behind but it's gonna be okay I do have some Hotel time scheduled in for myself
35:22
towards the end of the month and those tend to be more successful kind of catch-up days but I also know that the further get behind the harder it is to
35:29
catch up so we'll see how it goes hopefully I'm gonna get it together but hopefully enjoyed looking at the
35:35
notebooks don't forget to comment down below to enter to win one of the giveaway notebooks you can choose which
35:41
one and I will see you guys in day 12 Vlog I hope your writing is going well and I'm sending you all my love

foreign [Music]
35:57
[Music]
but I really really needed a Starbucks
0:02
to put it lightly
0:06
[Music]
0:12
[Music]
0:29
hello everybody happy day 10 except it
0:33
is already 9 pm and I'm tired and I'm
0:37
still also drinking coffee so this is
0:40
this is what we're doing today but I
0:42
really really needed a Starbucks
0:44
to put it lightly let's just do a little
0:47
story time
0:48
um so my son Andrew he's 10. but for the
0:51
past three weeks we have been
0:55
recurring illness with him and I won't
0:58
go into all the stuff but it started
0:59
with a stomach bug that kind of passed
1:01
through most of the family then he had a
1:04
fever so once he was better he missed
1:06
like a week of school once he was better
1:08
he went back to school and he was fine
1:10
and then two days later
1:12
has a fever again then he starts
1:15
coughing you know starts coming down
1:17
with some of the like cough in his chest
1:19
not covered so we're like okay you know
1:22
it's just a cold like seasonal cold like
1:25
out of 17 kids in his classroom 14 of
1:28
the kids were out because they were sick
1:30
so it's not just Andrew it's kind of
1:32
going around I think everybody's immune
1:33
systems have been
1:35
um just like not exposed to this type of
1:38
illness in a while and so it's going
1:40
through apparently the entire town that
1:42
I live in and maybe even the world who
1:44
knows but
1:46
uh long story short he's been out of
1:49
school multiple times he's been sick for
1:51
about three weeks off and on and feeling
1:54
fine yesterday come home get wakes up
1:57
this morning at you know 7 A.M and he
2:00
said Mommy I don't feel good 100 degree
2:02
fever so we went straight to the doctor
2:04
and we waited for five hours to be seen
2:09
um to say that was a frustrating morning
2:11
I did try to do some work while I was in
2:14
the doctors like in the waiting room but
2:16
at the same time it's like you've got a
2:18
kid who doesn't feel well who just wants
2:20
to be comfortable he just wants to lay
2:21
down but I was thinking oh my gosh we
2:24
have to get him seen today like I can't
2:26
leave we need to figure out what this is
2:28
in case it's something more serious
2:31
so once we get in there
2:33
um it was like another hour of
2:36
every test like flu mono
2:40
um just everything and everything came
2:43
back negative so all they could say was
2:45
probably upper respiratory infection
2:47
we're going to give him antibiotics
2:49
which I don't really like
2:52
um for myself taking antibiotics unless
2:54
I know it's absolutely necessary so it's
2:56
kind of like oh I don't I hate to give
2:58
him antibiotics we'll just have to give
2:59
them good probiotics too but at the same
3:01
time like he's something's going on
3:03
that's not being cured so we're just
3:05
gonna try what the doctor says
3:08
um so
3:09
then we they prescribed
3:12
um a couple different medications we
3:14
went into Walmart and they were like
3:16
it'll be about 30 minutes then they said
3:19
you know what it's going to be probably
3:20
an hour so I said I'm just taking this
3:22
kid home so I took him home he got some
3:25
rest I worked on the rest of those
3:27
giveaways and getting them um like
3:29
shipped out and stuff and then I thought
3:31
okay well I'll take all these giveaway
3:32
packages to the Post Office and then
3:36
I'll just drop by Walmart and pick up
3:37
the prescriptions I'm thinking it's
3:39
going to be like 30 minute round trip
3:41
and here we go
3:42
get to Walmart and they're out of both
3:46
of the medicines that were ordered for
3:49
him so then I had to wait another hour
3:50
while they called his doctor it was such
3:53
a run around I have been in Waiting
3:55
rooms in one way or another for about
3:57
nine or so hours today and I was hitting
4:01
that point where I was like okay I'm
4:03
just gonna cry
4:04
but I hung in there I will do whatever
4:07
it takes to make sure my son is taken
4:09
care of so uh he did end up getting his
4:12
antibiotic and he's resting upstairs now
4:14
and hopefully he's gonna go to sleep
4:15
pretty soon
4:17
um but his fever keeps jumping to like
4:19
103 so that sucks Evie so far is doing
4:23
well but she's also like uh getting
4:25
irritated and crying a little bit more
4:27
than she normally would so I'm worried
4:30
that she's gonna wake up sick tomorrow
4:31
or in the middle of the night when I
4:33
should be sleeping and she should be
4:34
sleeping so this is part of the
4:37
challenges of being a writer who also
4:39
has outside responsibilities whether
4:42
that is kids for you or
4:45
um spouse or your caretaking for an
4:48
elderly parent or other family member or
4:51
if it's just your fur babies and your
4:53
full-time job like whatever it is that
4:55
you have going on it can sometimes feel
4:58
like
4:59
it just never stops you know and it
5:02
doesn't like the world doesn't slow down
5:03
or stop for us just because we decided
5:05
we were going to try to write a novel in
5:07
50 in 30 days and 50 000 were novel in
5:10
30 days the world keeps going and that
5:12
is true when you are a professional
5:14
author and a YouTuber and all that stuff
5:17
and part of your job
5:19
is to know when it's too much for you
5:22
and you need to slow down and when
5:25
you're on the right path
5:27
but whatever your responsibilities are
5:31
sometimes it's going to mean you don't
5:33
have the writing day that you expected
5:35
sometimes it's going to mean you don't
5:36
launch the book when you wanted or for
5:39
an entire year you don't launch the book
5:40
that you expected and sometimes that's
5:43
going to mean a loss of momentum but
5:45
what I hope that I can share with you
5:47
now that I have learned painstakingly
5:50
over the last you know 12 years of
5:52
publishing professionally is that any
5:54
deadline you miss or any nanowrimo that
5:57
you just don't hit the 50k or anything
5:59
like that those are just moments in time
6:02
and they don't make or break your value
6:05
as a writer and they don't make or break
6:06
your chance at having a career I have
6:09
made mistakes I have you know chosen
6:11
YouTube and courses over writing as many
6:14
books I have chosen a family sometimes
6:16
over writing as many books and sometimes
6:18
it means my sales are lower than I want
6:21
them to be but then sometimes I release
6:22
a new book finally after year and sales
6:24
are really high and that's the way this
6:27
whole business is is ups and downs and
6:29
when you're up you're afraid what if I
6:31
can't maintain it and when you're down
6:33
you're thinking what if I can't ever get
6:35
where I want to be and everywhere in
6:37
between there's going to be doubts
6:39
there's going to be illnesses there's
6:40
going to be doctors visits that come up
6:43
there's going to be all kinds of things
6:44
but if I could give you one piece of
6:46
encouragement it would be this
6:49
as long as you don't give up on your
6:52
dreams
6:54
you're still going to get where you want
6:55
it to go it just might take a little bit
6:58
longer or it might take a different path
7:00
or it might look or feel a little
7:01
different than you originally expected
7:03
but you're still going to get where you
7:05
want to go and you will get there
7:06
exactly when you were meant to be there
7:08
and I truly believe that so today
7:11
instead of feeling frustrated by
7:14
doctor's appointments and so forth I'm
7:16
going to choose to feel really grateful
7:18
that my son is a healthy boy and that
7:22
he's gonna get over this quickly and
7:24
that we just spend a day or two of our
7:27
year in you know a hospital when I know
7:30
there are other people who spend a lot
7:32
more time than that with their family
7:33
members in the hospital so I'm going to
7:35
be grateful for that I'm going to be
7:36
grateful for modern medicine and
7:38
antibiotics and hopefully him waking up
7:41
feeling much better tomorrow and I'm
7:43
also going to be super grateful for you
7:45
know getting a quick Starbucks and
7:47
having the ability to do that and also
7:51
for all of you for watching and always
7:53
encouraging me and also for the
7:56
opportunity to sit down and write some
7:58
books so a little bit of a talk from me
8:01
I did not have the energy to pull those
8:02
notebooks out so we will do that
8:04
hopefully tomorrow but what I'm going to
8:06
do right now is I have my
8:08
um my iPad set up here and I'm going to
8:11
just do one quick little Sprint and then
8:14
I'm going to like I think I'm going to
8:16
color in my Hello Kitty coloring book
8:19
yes of course I have two Hello Kitty
8:21
coloring books and I'm just gonna binge
8:24
watch some YouTube and just do some
8:25
little self-care uh with that but I am
8:27
going to get a few words in it's not
8:29
going to be the plotting day I
8:30
originally hoped it's not going to be
8:32
you know all of that too but you know
8:34
what I'm okay with that I'm still moving
8:36
forward I'm proud of what I've done so
8:37
far and so today just won't be as far
8:41
forward or as quickly forward as I hoped
8:43
but there's always tomorrow all right
8:45
let's do some writing
8:47
so my messy unmade bed and I have my
8:54
iPad Pro here and my Bluetooth keyboard
8:57
some people have asked for a keyboard
9:00
video specifically so maybe that'll be
9:01
coming soon I got this one off of Amazon
9:03
and I have similar ones to this just a
9:06
different brand that are Bluetooth
9:08
keyboards I have one in pink and one in
9:10
mint green and then I just have this um
9:14
this little kind of knock off of the
9:16
Logitech
9:18
Mouse I have my little caddy here that I
9:21
set up and I have my plotting cards
9:23
these are like my plotting cheat sheets
9:25
and I'm also going to log into some of
9:28
rhiannon's Sprints I think over on
9:30
YouTube while I do this
9:32
um and I'll probably just put her up on
9:34
the TV let's do some writing
9:36
[Music]
9:51
foreign
9:54
[Music]
10:23
okay 477 so I ended up with 14 180 words
10:29
and I only really did like one Sprint
10:32
with Rhiannon tonight but
10:35
I have set a mood here in my room I
10:38
should have put some ambient stuff or
10:40
removed Rhiannon up to the thing but I
10:44
um and don't worry those candles are not
10:46
as close to that as it looks like but I
10:48
have set a mood and I'm falling asleep
10:50
as I'm trying to write so I ended up
10:52
with four a little over 470 words
10:55
and that is just the most that I'm going
10:56
to be able to do tonight and that is
10:58
okay so if you have a day coming up or
11:00
you've had a day so far or most of the
11:02
day so far just haven't been possible
11:04
it's okay be kind to yourself I am
11:08
definitely going to do my best to rest
11:11
and relax and see how tomorrow is I have
11:14
a couple meetings in the morning but
11:15
I'll hopefully be back with some
11:17
notebook Challenge and some plotting a
11:19
back too so I will see you then I hope
11:22
your writing is going well and I hope
11:24
that you and your family are staying
11:26
healthy
11:27
all right sending my love
11:29
good night

1:39
hey guys so it is day nine and I have
1:42
been busy all day so it is already 302
1:45
and I had a long meeting with my
1:48
business Mentor today to talk about
1:50
plans for 2023 that was about an hour
1:52
and a half this morning then I was with
1:55
the kids or with Evie had lunch and then
1:59
worked on the Vlog for today and now I
2:02
have been working on giveaways and I
2:04
knew I was going to spend most of the
2:05
day doing this so in the month of
2:06
October I do a kind of like an
2:09
anniversary party for this book
2:11
beautiful demons which came out in 2010
2:14
and it came out October 29th and so
2:16
every year we celebrate the you know
2:19
anniversary of my very first novel and
2:22
so it involves over a thousand dollars
2:24
worth of giveaways and prizes and things
2:26
like that and it's 13 days of so much
2:28
fun and so now that it's over I'm
2:31
working on getting all the giveaways out
2:32
so I have some of that stuff that you
2:34
saw that I ordered for the book signing
2:36
I'm using here so because I thought it
2:38
would be really fun for fans to know
2:41
that they're on the lookout for a big
2:42
purple envelope or a box with purple
2:45
tape although this tape turned out to be
2:47
more
2:48
burgundy than purple online on the Uline
2:51
site it looked to be almost this color
2:54
and so I thought it would be a brighter
2:55
purple but you know it's fine I might
2:57
try to order something different
3:00
so I have some that are just single
3:02
books of beautiful demons I have some
3:04
that are signed posters and some of the
3:06
giveaways are full sets of series and I
3:09
know that I don't actually talk a lot
3:11
about everything that I write here on
3:13
this channel like I don't think I've
3:15
ever gone over like every single one of
3:17
my books but I have my Shadow Demon Saga
3:20
series is the one that sold over half a
3:22
million copies and there are 11 books in
3:24
this main series and there's a couple of
3:25
spin-off things so there's like a
3:28
standalone novel that's spin off there's
3:30
a novella that says spin-off and book 12
3:32
is the final I believe book in the
3:35
series that'll be hopefully coming out
3:36
next year then I also have another
3:38
spin-off series from the Shadow Demons
3:41
it's in the same world called sacrifice
3:43
me and this one was originally released
3:47
in a Serial format so there are six
3:50
episodes in here and it's mostly one
3:53
point of view but then it does there
3:54
there's a second point of view in here
3:56
and these are new adults so my Shadow
3:59
Demons books are our young adult but
4:01
then the later you get in the series the
4:03
more they age up so like Harper starts
4:06
out 15 16 years old and then she ends up
4:08
you know in her 20s by the end of the
4:10
series
4:10
sacrifice me starts with the main
4:13
heroine Frankie turning 21 and getting
4:15
invited to this club called Venom that
4:17
doesn't actually exist you can't find it
4:19
and it of course ends up being a magical
4:22
club and this one has Crow shifters and
4:24
there's just a lot of fun to this series
4:25
but it is a little bit more
4:28
paranormal romance whereas beautiful
4:30
demon series is more like contemporary
4:32
fantasy with a strong romantic element
4:34
this one is a romance so sacrifice me is
4:37
more of a romance there are two seasons
4:39
to it and this the first season I
4:41
published is six individual episodes and
4:44
then
4:45
boxed it up as a single series and then
4:48
season two I released in sets of three
4:50
episodes each so this is part one and
4:52
part two I don't recommend doing that I
4:55
think I made a big mistake doing that
4:57
but we won't go into that today we're
4:59
just gonna say there are no mistakes
5:00
there's just lessons to be learned so
5:03
sacrifice me is complete with these
5:05
three volumes which is really season one
5:07
and season two
5:08
and then I also have my series that's
5:11
called Eternal Sorrows so this is a
5:13
zombie apocalypse slash magic
5:17
um sort of like portal fantasy type
5:19
mashup and this Series has a lot of
5:22
different elements it has like eight
5:24
different points of view it's a zombie
5:26
apocalypse so it's a pandemic novel
5:28
where there's also magic and there's uh
5:32
you know the idea of kind of like
5:34
Eternal people who are uh reincarnated
5:37
over and over again as Guardians of the
5:39
world and so this is a young adult
5:42
and this you know has the multiple
5:44
points of view and everything else so
5:46
there's three books in this series
5:47
death's Awakening
5:49
sorrow's gift and fate surrender and
5:52
then there will be one final book coming
5:54
in this hopefully next year as well and
5:56
I haven't revealed the title for that so
5:58
I'm giving away full sets of those I do
6:00
also have other series and books besides
6:03
those but those were kind of the
6:04
giveaways and then I have these posters
6:07
here that are the book covers for the
6:10
Shadow Demon Saga just without the
6:12
titles and words on them and then I sign
6:14
those and I'm going to send them in that
6:15
poster tube so this isn't all the
6:17
giveaways I also one of the giveaways is
6:19
a t-shirt that's in there and I have
6:22
these little buttons that I'm sending in
6:25
the bigger boxes I have these I heart
6:28
Indie stickers that I made a while back
6:31
when it was still kind of taboo to be an
6:33
indie author so I made those for people
6:35
and then I also have a
6:39
postcard to put into the books that just
6:42
has all the book covers for the Shadow
6:43
Demon Saga and it says if you need me
6:45
I'll be in the shadow world
6:46
and then I have book plates so I'm
6:51
sending these all of my fans can get
6:53
these book plates for free like all you
6:55
have to do is just let christabel know
6:57
that you want one and you can get one
6:58
for free but then if you order let's say
7:00
six paperbacks off Amazon you can just
7:02
send her a receipt and she'll send you
7:04
six of these so that you can put them in
7:06
the front of your book with my signature
7:07
on them and so I'm also sending an extra
7:11
one of these out with any of the books
7:13
just in case somebody wants to put it on
7:14
their notebook or their iPad or anything
7:17
like that so those are kind of the
7:19
goodies I was using the arch and Olive
7:21
acrylograph pins to sign the poster so
7:25
that it's more of a paint pen and I was
7:27
using this gift of these Sharpie s gel
7:30
pen the purple ones to sign these books
7:33
so again I still don't know who sent
7:34
them Diane marasco sent me some
7:37
sharpie-s gel pens last year and I think
7:39
I did Vlog it but they were like the
7:42
Frosted blue ones and I love those as
7:44
well so thank you to everybody who sends
7:46
me pens like that is always a good gift
7:49
and always well appreciated but I'm
7:51
really loving the look of the tissue
7:54
paper and basically what I'm doing is I
7:56
sign the books and I'm just putting all
7:58
of those little goodies into the front
8:00
of it
8:01
and then I am wrapping them up kind of
8:03
like a Christmas present and I usually
8:06
will have Circle stickers to close them
8:09
up like a little seal but I didn't have
8:10
that so I just printed them and cut them
8:13
out into squares and that's fine so I've
8:14
got my little logo that kind of seals up
8:16
the little package and then it goes into
8:18
the envelope or into the box
8:21
and that is the package and I will be
8:24
sending all of these media mail so that
8:28
saves some money except I do have a few
8:31
going internationally and it's so crazy
8:32
because like this book going Media Mail
8:34
is like three dollars this book going to
8:37
Ireland is like thirty dollars so but I
8:40
I value my International fans I have a
8:43
global audience and so I always want
8:44
them to be included in the giveaway so
8:46
I'm happy to pay the shipping to get
8:48
those out to people
8:50
um but there were other gifts like a
8:52
witchy starter kit some crystals some
8:55
tarot cards and all that stuff so that's
8:57
all in process but I wanted to get all
8:59
of this out today so my next steps are
9:02
to finish packaging these up go into my
9:05
computer weigh everything and get them
9:07
sent out and the mailing labels on them
9:10
and then I will just take these into the
9:12
post office tomorrow to send them out
9:14
and
9:16
then it'll probably be family afternoon
9:18
so I think it's going to be another day
9:20
where I don't get started writing until
9:21
the evening but since I had such a nice
9:23
day yesterday if I can get a thousand to
9:25
two thousand words today I'll be happy
9:27
so I just wanted to kind of show you my
9:29
process of giveaways so hopefully that
9:31
was helpful in case you're doing some of
9:33
your own so I'll probably come to regret
9:35
this but if you've never tried crumble
9:37
cookies
9:39
they are so good sometimes every once in
9:41
a while we'll just go and try one of
9:43
each because their flavors change every
9:45
week and I can't even tell you what all
9:47
these flavors are right now I'll just
9:49
try to put them on the screen I know
9:51
this one is like a peanut butter
9:52
chocolate one and this might be
9:54
something pumpkin and that's just like
9:56
sugar pink sugar and chocolate chip but
9:59
they're so good and we just like split
10:02
them into like six ways and then
10:03
everybody gets just a little piece of
10:05
everything
10:06
but yeah I still need to get my writing
10:09
done so I'm probably gonna regret having
10:11
all this sugar but it's gonna be
10:13
delicious
10:15
okay so let's talk Daiso and my 10 000
10:19
word reward which I haven't actually
10:21
chosen everything yet so this table is
10:24
basically I just took it all out of the
10:26
bag and put it here on the table so this
10:31
is basically the things that I got so
10:33
there's like keycaps and erasers and
10:36
lots of little sticky notes some things
10:38
there's a little um tokidoki pin case
10:41
and a pill bottle there's these little
10:45
um Donatella surprise thing there's
10:48
Washi tapes there's little uh Ziploc
10:51
bags and correction tape tons of little
10:54
stickers here more Washi tapes some
10:57
notebooks and that kind of thing so what
11:00
I had decided was since I bought this
11:03
many of you know from my 90 day reset
11:05
video that I can't actually like buy
11:08
myself stuff and spend money unless I've
11:09
earned it but I haven't really been
11:11
great about keeping track of my points
11:14
so far because October just just ended
11:15
up being so busy it was a really hard
11:17
time I should have had all my like point
11:20
system figured out before I started the
11:23
month so
11:25
that has not worked out exactly the way
11:27
that I wanted it to so I haven't
11:30
actually been able to like spend a lot
11:32
of money on myself other than the
11:34
subscription boxes and things that I've
11:35
gotten is pretty much where all the
11:37
points that I do have have been going so
11:39
I bought this stuff so it ended up being
11:43
143 dollars total and that included a
11:47
couple things for the kids as well so
11:49
somewhere around a hundred dollars worth
11:51
of stuff here on the table so what I'm
11:53
gonna do is I'm just gonna split it into
11:55
two piles and it'll be one I get now for
11:58
ten thousand and the other one I get for
12:00
my twenty thousand reward and what I'm
12:02
actually going to try to do is figure
12:03
out what are the things I'm looking
12:04
forward to the most like maybe this pen
12:07
case definitely this surprise box
12:10
um maybe some of these uh sticky notes
12:13
and I'm going to save those for the 20
12:15
000 rewards so that it'll be a little
12:17
bit more exciting and I will leave it
12:18
out here where I can see it so I'm gonna
12:20
show you guys what I chose
12:23
okay so I have the ten thousand and the
12:25
20 000 reward and there's a little bit
12:28
more stuff in the 20 000 reward which I
12:31
think sounds normal now I do have these
12:34
they're like baby wipe Lids so it still
12:37
is going to count as mine but this will
12:38
go in EB's now she's potty trained but
12:40
we still use wipes in our kind of daily
12:42
life so I have those in Hello Kitty and
12:45
the karomi one so I'm gonna go ahead and
12:47
get those I have a pill case I have this
12:49
little koromi like coin purse some Washi
12:54
tapes some correction tape that is uh
12:57
tokidoki a54 subject notebook some cute
13:01
hand sanitizer
13:03
some more sort of Tokidoki Washi tapes
13:06
uh Disney washi tape some sticker flakes
13:10
some keycaps and some various stickers
13:12
and then these are kuromi little uh
13:16
Ziploc bags basically that you could put
13:18
candy in or stickers or hair ties or
13:21
whatever and then a variety of other
13:23
stickers so yay 10 000 reward and
13:27
actually I have now so I've got ten
13:29
thousand eleven thousand something words
13:31
that I've written so far during Nano but
13:33
I also had about 7 000 words that I
13:35
wrote before the month started and I
13:37
have actually hit the Act One climax
13:40
scenes which I think is why I wrote so
13:42
much yesterday so I'm going to continue
13:44
on with that act one climax scene
13:46
tonight and then I'm going to need to
13:51
kind of re-plot some of the stuff that
13:53
happens at the beginning of act two so
13:54
that's the plan for tomorrow but I need
13:57
to get Evie in the bath and then I will
13:59
come back and get a little bit of
14:01
writing in and then kind of play with my
14:02
goodies oh so I side note about this
14:04
little package I'm sorry that the light
14:06
is not better in here I still have a
14:08
bunch of mess over there but all I have
14:10
is this giant
14:12
um one on the ceiling here so we're just
14:15
going to come back to that but uh my
14:18
next door neighbor is actually really
14:20
really close friends with Laurel Denise
14:22
and some of you may know her I've never
14:24
bought her planner but it's the one that
14:26
you can see it's like really big and
14:28
then you can see the monthly weekly
14:30
daily Pages like all in one and it has
14:33
like a wire o binding but when she was
14:37
here visiting when Laurel Denise was
14:39
here visiting my neighbor uh my neighbor
14:42
doesn't drink coffee and so they were
14:43
like do you have any coffee and so of
14:45
course I was supplying her with coffee
14:47
every morning and then in exchange she's
14:50
sent over this lovely monthly Edition
14:52
Laurel Denise planner and set of sticky
14:55
notes an inner gel pen and some like
14:59
daily washi tape number stuff so how
15:02
funny is that that I happen to live next
15:04
door to
15:05
someone who is like nearly best friends
15:08
with a professional planner designer I
15:10
mean what are the odds y'all I am living
15:12
my dream life hey everybody so I feel
15:15
like I don't have the best Lighting in
15:17
here and I apologize for that I do have
15:19
a beautiful view of the Moon out the
15:21
window though and it is 9 00 p.m I have
15:24
not gotten any writing done and I'm
15:27
super tired I think it has taken me a
15:29
couple of days to really feel the
15:31
fatigue of the trip and all the things
15:34
that are on my mind plus I started my
15:36
day with an hour and a half meeting
15:37
talking about all my plans for 2022 so
15:40
my mind has been kind of racing plus I
15:42
ate sugar so there's a lot of factors
15:45
here that are not really surprising as
15:46
to why I feel the way I do but I do not
15:49
want to end the day without any writing
15:50
I was hoping I could catch up to the you
15:53
know whatever it is that I need for the
15:54
day 13 000 something maybe or that was
15:57
yesterday I think I'm supposed to be at
15:59
15K today there's no way no way that's
16:03
happening and really I'm at the end of
16:06
act one and as you can see from my chart
16:11
I do not have Act 2 fully decided yet I
16:14
know what's happening at the midpoint
16:15
but there's some questions about what
16:16
happens in between so I was trying to
16:19
decide do I want to try to work on that
16:22
tonight or do I want to write and I
16:25
think I'm just going to try to do like
16:26
one Sprint don't push myself but there's
16:29
also that part of me that's like panic
16:31
because it's like if you don't get at
16:33
least a couple thousand words
16:35
you're going to be behind even more but
16:38
you can't push yourself beyond what
16:40
you're capable of and sometimes pushing
16:42
yourself too hard one night means like
16:45
knocking over the dominoes for the you
16:47
know like messing up that row of
16:49
dominoes for the next week or two for
16:51
now I want to get a little bit of
16:53
writing in so just one Sprint and then
16:55
I'm calling it a night and I'm gonna
16:56
rest
16:58
foreign
17:24
well on one hand I think it's good that
17:27
I'm not expecting too much of myself but
17:30
on the other hand let me just tell you
17:32
how fun and wonderful it is to sit down
17:35
and not put pressure on myself and just
17:37
say okay I'm gonna allow myself to rest
17:39
but I'm gonna sit down and get some
17:41
words in
17:43
I ended up with 1835 words boom like I
17:48
don't know where this is coming from
17:49
maybe it's just getting the dang
17:52
pressure off my shoulders a little bit
17:54
of having to be perfect having to show
17:56
up 100 and just saying whatever happens
17:58
happens it'll be okay and the truth is I
18:01
actually traditionally respond very well
18:04
to pressure like I need that pressure I
18:06
need that external pressure but I think
18:08
sometimes when you haven't been writing
18:11
for a while sometimes you need to switch
18:13
it up and take some of the pressure off
18:14
because I've got a lot of pressure going
18:16
on in other parts Plus in my own mind
18:18
for a long time I've had a lot of
18:20
pressure around my writing so maybe I
18:21
just needed to take some of that
18:23
pressure off so I am total at thirteen
18:26
thousand seven hundred and three words
18:28
and I need to be at I'm looking at the
18:31
Nano site I should be at an even fifteen
18:33
thousand so I'm really just shy of 1300
18:36
words behind which is achievable that is
18:40
not bad that those are some good words
18:42
right there and I really liked to the
18:43
words that I wrote tonight
18:45
again I didn't set a timer I didn't set
18:48
a 20 minute timer I didn't join in any
18:50
Sprints and maybe that's been helping me
18:52
right now although I do plan to join
18:55
some Sprints this weekend because I
18:56
would like to hang out with my heart
18:58
breathings writing community and just as
19:00
a reminder we do have Sprints going on
19:02
every day from different uh like
19:04
different writers so you can find those
19:07
on YouTube or Facebook so I'm going to
19:08
link that heartbreakings writing
19:09
Community down below it's a page there's
19:12
a page on my website you can find the
19:13

19:16

19:18
linked so I do want to join in with some
19:21

19:22
goes live on Thursday so I'm going to
19:24
try to join her tomorrow night but
19:27
I have officially finished act one
19:31
Act One climax is complete and so
19:33
tomorrow I think I'm just gonna you know
19:36
I'm gonna rest as much as I can tonight
19:37
it's getting close to 10 p.m so I'm
19:39
gonna rest I'm going to get up in the
19:42
morning and I'm gonna work on the Act 2
19:45

19:49

19:50

19:54
is feeling good I I the further I get
19:56

good night
happy day eight everybody I cannot
1:19
believe it is already the eighth we are
1:21
a full week into nanowrimo
1:24
um did the Voting thing today and now we
1:28
are working so I am on a zoom call with
1:31
my very good friend Jen and I am sitting
1:34
in front of this lovely window which is
1:36
just one of the joys of my new house is
1:39
there's just so many windows and it just
1:41
makes me so happy to sit here with this
1:43
window and look look out at the green
1:45
grass that is turning brown in the
1:47
winter
1:49
um but I am at 78 11 words I'm gonna get
1:51
some writing done we stopped and got
1:53
some coffee as you can see I opened up
1:55
my simply gilded washi tape subscription
1:58
that came in so that brought me a little
1:59
bit of Joy but I am looking forward to
2:01
earning that Daiso stuff that I got so
2:04
I'm ready to do it I also was kind of
2:07
talking to Jen about uh some ideas I
2:10
have for kickstart starter after the
2:12
trip so that's fun and I've got all that
2:14
running through my mind but I'm trying
2:15
to say okay Sarah
2:17
Focus yourself in on the things that
2:19
need to get done right now which is the
2:21
book so I'm trying to
2:24
have this be a bit more of a gist day
2:27
which means get your together and
2:30
that of course if you the first person I
2:32
ever had heard used that term was Kaylin
2:34
Nicholson so I will link her Channel
2:35
Down Below because I super love her and
2:37
she's going through some stuff right now
2:40
that I do not envy so I'm sending all
2:43
the support her away and just wanting to
2:46
send her a little bit of love even
2:47
though she doesn't know who I am but
2:48
anyway that term just has been such a
2:51
good one for me I love like she talks
2:53
about to have these days where it's kind
2:55
of like okay these are the days where
2:57
I'm gonna really start to get my stuff
2:58
together get my life together and uh you
3:02
know well my life is together but I'm
3:04
just gonna get my together
3:06
um I love those kind of days because
3:08
it's like you can just make a to-do list
3:09
and just power through some stuff and
3:11
then you're kind of set up for the rest
3:13
of the week or whatever because this
3:15
room is clean and tidy but outside that
3:18
door there all of my Halloween stuff is
3:20
still in the hallway all of my clothes
3:22
from the ram conference are still kind
3:26
of out and about I've got laundry to do
3:27
I've got boxes I have three packages I
3:30
haven't even opened yet so there's a lot
3:32
of stuff so today is going to be one of
3:34
those days and it is already almost 11.
3:36
so I'm gonna get some writing done we
3:39
have
3:40
um we have a 15 minute timer on the
3:42
clock here and I'm gonna
3:44
get some writing probably a couple
3:45
Sprints and then I'll do lunch and then
3:47
after lunch I'll edit my Vlog for today
3:50
day seven Vlog and then I'm going to
3:53
hopefully power through some cleaning so
3:56
let's try to get it because I want to
3:57
get a little over 2 000 words today I
4:00
know I can do it
4:01
going day eight
4:09
[Music]
4:14
foreign
4:16
[Music]
4:24
okay so it is 11 41 and I got just over
4:28
a thousand words and then I had a little
4:30
lunch companion come to tell me that
4:32
Lunch is ready so I'm gonna go eat and
4:35
then get back to work I'm determined I'm
4:37
gonna hit that 7K today I know I can do
4:39
it okay so I've been working on um the
4:42
Vlog for day seven and George said oh my
4:45
God and you line boxes so boxes for my
4:48
book signing have arrived
4:52
[Music]
4:57
foreign
5:00
okay so I have tissue paper to wrap the
5:03
books and stuff like that so I have a
5:04
dark purple and a pink these are both
5:07
brand colors and then I also just
5:08
grabbed some light pink for heart
5:10
breathings giveaways I have some paper
5:13
to work as void filler and then I have
5:15
some purple tape to
5:19
like kind of decorate the boxes and then
5:22
I got purple bubble mailers
5:25
for the books that are like single or
5:27
double orders and then the rest is boxes
5:30
so it's a lot okay it is 2 30 and I have
5:36
the Vlog is uploading now so that is all
5:39
done I got a ton of stuff done this
5:41
morning like you know I got some writing
5:43
done as well so now it's just time and
5:48
what I really like to do at this point
5:50
like I know many of you asked how do you
5:52
keep your house clean and stuff like
5:53
that hello how are you okay you wanna
5:57
come sit with me
5:59
yeah I got my pet dragon
6:02
time
6:03
you have your pet dragon yeah what are
6:06
you doing with him I'm just taking him
6:08
for
6:10
a while here you can do it what can he
6:12
do he can fly
6:14
and he can sit and he can sit and we can
6:18
we can ride him you can ride that Dragon
6:21
yeah
6:22
yeah so at this point my gist process
6:25
and as you can see keeping the house
6:27
clean is not always something that I can
6:30
do every single day and I know there are
6:32
people out there who just naturally like
6:34
do a little bit every single day and
6:35
their house stays clean I have a husband
6:37
who stays home all day and he does the
6:39
best he can but we also have two young
6:40
kids including a toddler who brings out
6:42
toys all the time and we're just I was
6:45
gone so we're super busy so this is just
6:47
reality
6:48
you're my toddler what do you mean who
6:50
is the toddler
6:53
but this is kind of my process sometimes
6:56
when I like in terms of balance is that
6:59
when things you know I start to feel
7:01
that they're out of control plus I am
7:03
somebody who has to plan every Sunday
7:05
and when I don't get my planning done on
7:07
Sunday I feel like a boat with no anchor
7:11
and I just need that planning to settle
7:14
me for the week so I don't have time to
7:17
really make it like really pretty it's
7:19
already Tuesday going into Wednesday so
7:21
I'm just gonna make my task list and
7:23
that's going to be enough and that's
7:24
going to serve partially as my gist list
7:27
as well the gist list is mostly going to
7:29
consist of
7:30
cleaning stuff so there's boxes to be
7:33
put away there's uh laundry to be put
7:36
away I need to just clean up the toys
7:38
tidy up put away mail I like I said I
7:41
have three packages I haven't opened yet
7:42
I'll see if I can show those to you so
7:44
I'm gonna try to get that stuff clean
7:46
plus it's going to involve
7:53
the sun is shining right on your face
7:56
so it's also going to involve doing my
7:59
meal plan for the week because we had a
8:02
plan but now we're we don't have the
8:03
right groceries and everything that we
8:04
need so I need to see if I can place an
8:06
order for groceries that we can pick up
8:08
tonight because we're going out Tuesday
8:09
it's always pizza night but that is kind
8:12
of what it just is for me is I just make
8:14
those lists of all the things that have
8:15
kind of gotten out of hand and I just
8:17
start working on them and all the
8:18
cleaning might not get done probably
8:20
won't get done today but it will get
8:22
done over the course of the next few
8:23
days and
8:24
thank you and by making a list of all of
8:28
it other people can help me with it so
8:30
Andrew can help when he gets home from
8:32
school George can help I can say you do
8:34
this and I can delegate those tasks
8:36
because I know exactly what those tasks
8:37
are you named Your Dragon bow yeah oh I
8:41
love that
8:42
okay so just a few minutes maybe seven
8:45
minutes to sit and write this down and
8:47
then in my third column which is kind of
8:49
my six months for Life sort of personal
8:51
goal
8:52
I just put my gist list this is the main
8:55
list for the rest of today except for
8:57
some extra thing
9:00
um so this is the main list I'm going to
9:02
focus on for the rest of the day other
9:03
than getting a little bit more writing
9:05
in and then I'm gonna go publish that
9:07
video for day six so this is how I stay
9:10
on track and now probably what I'm going
9:12
to do is I'm going to set timers just
9:14
like I do for my writing so it'll be 25
9:17
minute timer and I'm gonna give myself
9:18
that 25 minutes to put away the
9:20
Halloween stuff and if I can get to the
9:22
ram
9:23
clothes and stuff like that I'll do that
9:25
next then I'll actually I'll probably
9:27
order groceries first because I want to
9:29
try to pick them up tonight and then
9:30
I'll do this next thing and then I try
9:33
to just tackle all this stuff 25 minutes
9:35
at a time and George can help me with
9:37
this when he gets home but he's gonna go
9:39
get Andrew in just a minute so I'm gonna
9:41
focus on these things and see how far I
9:43
can get
9:46
[Music]
10:05
thank you
10:15
[Music]
10:28
foreign
10:31
[Music]
11:02
foreign
11:05
[Music]
11:14
I just love these windows every single
11:17
day I'm in this house I'm so grateful
11:19
thinking back to our journey last year
11:21
when we didn't have a home and we were
11:24
trying to figure out where we belonged
11:25
and
11:27
this is exactly where we belonged all
11:29
along and it just
11:32
it brings me joy every single day I feel
11:34
grateful in my heart every single day so
11:37
I did two 25-minute sprints and I got
11:40
more than half the list so I still have
11:42
a few things to do but it's four and I
11:45
want to spend a little bit of time with
11:46
the kids I want to help Andrew with his
11:48
homework we're gonna go out to dinner
11:49
but I did get the groceries ordered and
11:51
I got a lot of things cleaned up and I
11:53
also got the laundry started and lots of
11:57
stuff so when you're focused you can get
11:59
some good stuff done and even if you
12:01
only have one 20 minute Sprint a day you
12:03
could get some of those bigger projects
12:05
done and I tend to worry more about the
12:08
places that are the shared family places
12:10
the places that I'm walking through all
12:11
the time my closet is not the worst
12:16
right now but it's also not the cleanest
12:18
place
12:19
and I'm not going to focus on the closet
12:21
right now because I only go in there for
12:23
a very brief moment every day and so I'm
12:26
gonna focus on the places that will have
12:28
the biggest impact in the way I feel and
12:30
how organized I feel which are these
12:32
like Community Family areas and then
12:34
once that is put together then I'll
12:36
focus on those smaller areas and that's
12:38
kind of how I tend to clean in my home
12:41
is I worry about those bigger spaces
12:43
first and I try to set those 25 minute
12:45
timers so if you haven't done that
12:47
before try that and if you actually have
12:49
kids that are old enough to help clean
12:51
up and you have a partner you could give
12:53
everybody an assignment set a 25 minute
12:55
timer and then everybody does their
12:57
thing that helps us a lot too because
12:59
it's getting like Fast progress which
13:01
builds good momentum so that is done I'm
13:04
gonna go spend time with the kids and I
13:06
will check in with you guys after dinner
13:07
to hopefully hit that 10K
13:10
hey so we went to dinner we had bath
13:14
time fun time outside in the garden time
13:17
and we are all family to out George is
13:19
putting Evie to bed upstairs and so I
13:22
thought I would open up these packages
13:24
that I've had for a bit so I'm gonna
13:27
open them and then I'll show you what I
13:29
got
13:30
the first order is from lunar spark shop
13:35
and it's so perfect that I got these
13:37
right around the full moon because I'm
13:39
going to be doing a little full moon
13:40
ritual tonight but these this is a shop
13:43
on Etsy and she puts some really cool
13:45
stuff in the candles they almost always
13:46
come in these little tins and you can
13:48
get the small size or the bigger size
13:50
and these are just a few of them but
13:53
they're often they have crystals or
13:55
flowers and lots of glitter and things
13:57
like that and I just think they're
13:58
really beautiful
14:00
so
14:01
I will link this shop down below because
14:03
they're also pretty affordable I feel
14:06
like at least appear here in the states
14:07
so these are really pretty okay second
14:09
item is the witches Moon subscription
14:12
box so my friend Rhiannon fudge which
14:14
many of you know she runs Sprints for
14:17
our heart ratings writing Community she
14:19
told me about this box and I'm so glad
14:21
that she did so this is a monthly
14:23
subscription box and it's quite
14:25
affordable for all the stuff that you
14:27
get so I will link this down below for
14:28
you the final item is a gift that I gave
14:31
to myself after my 12 year anniversary
14:36
of my first novel that came up this
14:38
October and it is from story Arts who
14:42
makes those cool like writing gloves and
14:43
stuff like that they have an option to
14:46
make an infinity scarf that has your
14:49
choice of words on it and so I put the
14:51
first chapter of my beautiful Demon's
14:53
book which was the very first book that
14:55
I ever wrote so it has this entire first
14:58
chapter printed multiple times on here
15:00
and I'll be able to wear this as a scarf
15:02
how cool is this I just love it I think
15:04
it turned out beautifully and it's neat
15:07
to see my
15:09
own words on there so this is how it
15:12
will look kind of when it's
15:13
around your neck or something like that
15:16
it's just so cool and to know that it's
15:18
got my words on it this was pricey I
15:21
think it was like 75 dollars to have
15:22
this made but it's my words it's the
15:25
first words I ever published and I just
15:28
feel like that's super cool I wouldn't
15:30
obviously wear it with this shirt but I
15:32
just think
15:33
this is just kind of neat right I don't
15:35
know I love it this was kind of my like
15:37
anniversary gift to myself but it is
15:40
pushing 8 30 now so if I'm gonna get
15:43
that last thousand words in and still be
15:46
able to do a full moon ritual and I
15:47
really want I've been feeling the desire
15:49
ever since getting back from romance
15:51
author Mastermind to sit and read for a
15:54
little bit so I'm gonna try to get
15:56
another thousand words in or whatever it
15:58
turns out I need to hit that 10 000 for
16:01
the day and then I'm going to do some
16:03
full moon ritual stuff and then I'm
16:05
going to read before bed and it should
16:08
be a really nice evening and I'm looking
16:09
forward to it ah life is good
16:13
[Music]
16:27
okay I have been working for about an
16:31
hour and uh every time I look up I can
16:34
see I can see the moon right there just
16:38
I love this house I love there's I'm
16:41
just so in love with life right now and
16:44
I want to just give you a little bit of
16:46
encouragement that if you are going
16:48
through a rough time just know that it
16:51
is temporary there have been so many
16:54
times in my life when I have been down
16:55
and this time last year was definitely
16:58
one of them it was a tough time and yet
17:02
here I am a year later and it's not like
17:05
life is perfect you guys know I'm still
17:07
struggling from anxiety and other things
17:09
but it's just
17:11
I can feel that I'm where I'm meant to
17:13
be and I feel aligned and I feel guided
17:16
and I feel like all of that struggle was
17:19
leading me to everything that I needed
17:21
to learn to be the person that I am
17:23
right now and
17:25
so I want to send you that encouragement
17:27
too that if you've been struggling just
17:29
know that
17:30
this is not the end of your story that
17:32
you still have so much story to tell and
17:35
a year from now you're going to look
17:37
back on this time in your life and
17:39
you're gonna think oh my gosh I can see
17:40
now why I had to go through that and I
17:44
can see now how I can really appreciate
17:46
where I am right now
17:48
so I am gonna I'm in the middle of a
17:51
scene that I'm really liking so I'm
17:53
actually gonna keep going even though
17:54
I'm really close to my 10 000 word goal
17:58
for the day
17:59
um well not ten thousand in one day but
18:01
ten thousand total but I just have one
18:03
more scene I want to write so I'm gonna
18:04
keep going and then I'm going to uh
18:07
probably go sit under that full moon for
18:09
a little bit
18:10
[Music]
18:19
oh my gosh you guys so I just got into a
18:23
flow like I haven't gotten into in so
18:25
long I ended up with 11 868 so when I go
18:29
over two and I put that in the Nano site
18:30
I got 4057 words today which means I
18:34
have almost caught back up with par so
18:37
path to success says 13 333 so I am less
18:42
than 2 000 words behind at this point so
18:45
tomorrow's par is fifteen thousand so if
18:48
I can get another four thousand tomorrow
18:50
I'll be back on track just like that so
18:52
this is by far my biggest day of the
18:56
month and I don't even know how I just
18:58
did that so I got something like 1100
19:01
words this morning and then I sat down
19:05
wrote for an hour got another like 1200
19:07
words so that was 2400 and then I just
19:10
didn't set a timer and just started
19:12
writing and I ended up with this but now
19:15
I have been writing for a while and I
19:17
don't want to miss the moon so I am
19:19
gonna go outside and do some rituals
19:22
okay so I'm gonna end my night with my
19:25
full moon ritual and then I'm going to
19:27
get into my PJs and read for a little
19:30
bit I just need to decide which book I
19:32
want to read because I already finished
19:33
the one I was reading so uh yeah I'll
19:36
pick out a book I'll read a little bit
19:38
and it's gonna be a good night so thank
19:40
you so much for being on this nanowrimo
19:42
journey with me may your words flow may
19:45
they continue to flow throughout the
19:47
month and let us all find our joy in our
19:49
writing again all right I will see you
19:51

0:30
good morning day seven I'm back
0:33
in the land of home and there's a mess
0:38
so I have shoe boxes down here
0:41
um some of the stuff that I brought home
0:44
I feel like I'm always battling messes
0:46
because I'm just like not I'm naturally
0:49
a very organized person with my schedule
0:50
and like my stationary supplies but I've
0:54
always been a messy person when it comes
0:56
to like or untidy I guess so I've got my
1:00
suitcase full stuff that I have to get
1:03
and like even my side table is not
1:05
completely cleaned up
1:07
and then I just have little pockets of
1:10
things like my makeup needs to be put
1:11
away so typically when I come home from
1:15
a trip obviously number one priority is
1:18
just spending time with the family
1:20
especially you know Evie being away from
1:23
her a few days and she was sick while I
1:24
was gone she is feeling much better so
1:26
thank you all for the wishes I hate that
1:28
George got the brunt of that because
1:31
you know kids want their mommy most the
1:34
time when they're sick so
1:36
I am sad that he had to deal with that
1:40
alone and that I wasn't here for her so
1:42
she has been like sitting on my lap all
1:44
morning and playing around and you can
1:46
see when I was curling my hair she
1:48
wanted a curler too so George made her a
1:51
little
1:52
like tube that she could use as a hair
1:55
color curler she just wants to be just
1:57
like Mommy most of the time so
2:00
um
2:01
I am going to have my weekly meeting
2:04
with Renee and then I'm going I've got a
2:07
few other things going on but I'm going
2:08
to try to spend as much time with her as
2:10
possible today there's also so much like
2:13
my email well I don't know if my email
2:15
is blowing up but my social media is
2:16
blowing up and stuff with people like
2:18
talking about the conference and my
2:20
speech yesterday and I'm so so glad that
2:22
it resonated with so many people but I
2:23
know that ads like I need to create time
2:26
to like respond to people and nurture
2:28
those connections which is so important
2:30
after a conference like respond to
2:32
people and make sure that you're
2:33
friending people and and making and
2:35
keeping up with those connections so
2:37
that's a little bit of time that I need
2:38
to spend today so I haven't written for
2:41
two days I got a good night's sleep last
2:43
night so I'm hoping the plan for today
2:45
is meetings clean up spend time with the
2:49
family I need to order all the
2:52
paperbacks that were ordered now that
2:53
most the invoices are in so I need to
2:55
get that order so they're on their way
2:57
and then just uh trying to get if I can
3:01
a thousand words today that's my hope
3:03
and we're gonna keep moving forward so
3:07
thanks for understanding that I had you
3:09
know Vlog that was kind of meshed but
3:12
um
3:12
hopefully we're back on track now
3:15
one of those things too where I didn't
3:17
take my planner with me and so I it's a
3:20
Monday and I don't have my weekly plan
3:22
done so that if I have time to do that
3:24
today I will too but I don't want to
3:26
push myself either because you know you
3:27
always need a little bit of extras when
3:28
you get home so if you were there it was
3:31
so great to meet you if you were not
3:33
there trust me
3:36
you will get there someday like if
3:38
you're feeling fomo don't worry it's
3:39
like if it was meant to be your time you
3:40
would have been there but if you want it
3:42
then it will happen for you and it will
3:44
be great when it happens so you're not
3:46
you haven't missed anything that you
3:48
were meant to be there for and if it has
3:50
put a desire in your heart to be at a
3:52
future conference then you know that
3:54
that's an opportunity you can look
3:55
forward to in the future so
3:57
um all right I'm gonna get on with this
3:59
I'm excited to catch up with Renee and
4:02
get this day going so let's do it one
4:04
week today's week for the end of the
4:06
first week
4:07
gosh I can't believe it
4:09
hey guys it has been quite a big
4:12
afternoon I have been working on book
4:13
orders and got the Vlog up for days five
4:17
and six I literally just ordered thirty
4:20
two hundred dollars worth of paperbacks
4:22
to sign and it says it'll be here by
4:25
November 20th so I hope that means that
4:27
you guys will actually get to see them
4:29
and I'll get to share that virtual book
4:31
signing with you during the Nano Diaries
4:33
how fun is that I also have
4:36
um a little one
4:37
who has not left my side you just want
4:40
to be near mommy today
4:42
no so are you sitting by me
4:47
you waiting for me I love you
4:50
been sitting by me or in my lap or
4:52
hanging out with me
4:54
every moment of the day so that has been
4:56
very nice
4:57
um I've been taking some breaks and
4:59
enjoying my time with her so I am
5:03
hopefully finishing some things up
5:06
it's busy it's always busy coming back
5:08
from a conference it's like I want to
5:10
process the things that I learned on the
5:12
conference but there's also always a lot
5:14
of work to do so just continuing on but
5:16
we're gonna go to dinner in just a
5:18
little bit and then when I get back
5:19
tonight I'm gonna write
5:23
foreign
5:34
[Music]
5:39
s so I literally just ran I put Evie
5:43
down
5:44
for bed and just remembered that the
5:48
Powerball is up to almost two billion
5:51
dollars which I think maybe the largest
5:54
Lottery of all time at least in our
5:56
country probably everywhere
5:58
um so we ran to the local gas station
6:02
and I got there with two minutes to
6:04
spare I was like give me a quick pick I
6:07
don't we don't usually play the lottery
6:08
or buy tickets but when it's two billion
6:10
dollars why not just for fun so I guess
6:13
uh if I'm a billionaire by tomorrow I
6:15
will let you guys know
6:18
um so funny let me know if you bought a
6:20
ticket too what would you do with two
6:22
billion dollars this is like the
6:24
question of the day you don't actually
6:25
win two billion dollars of course you
6:27
get it's like a 1.9 billion dollar
6:29
jackpot but if you take the cash it's
6:32
929 million and then of course there's
6:34
federal taxes so it's probably something
6:36
like 500 million dollars
6:39
sounds like 2 billion but it's really
6:41
500 billion so
6:42
what would you do with 500 million
6:44
dollars
6:45
sometimes it's fun to dream about it I
6:48
would give so much money away I already
6:50
know I would I would give most of it
6:52
away probably I mean I would want our
6:53
family to be happy and healthy and I
6:55
would want to set up stuff for the kids
6:56
and I would want to be able to travel
6:58
and like never worry about money again
7:00
but then after that it's like you still
7:02
have like hundreds of millions of
7:04
dollars to give away you could you could
7:07
do so much for people it would be
7:09
amazing so anyway uh I
7:13
still have energy believe it or not I
7:16
feel like in the last Vlog when I was
7:17
editing it earlier I'm like oh my gosh
7:19
there are parts of that that I just look
7:20
so tired and my eye makeup got so uh but
7:24
this is part of the nanowrimo Diaries
7:27
charm I hope
7:29
is that
7:31
you get to see the real me which you
7:34
know is just not always perfect makeup I
7:37
think my I've been rubbing my eyes more
7:39
today so I noticed like my mascara is
7:41
halfway down my face so this is just me
7:44
so
7:45
come as you are this is how it is so I
7:48
still have clothes all over my bed that
7:50
still need to be like put in the laundry
7:52
and things like that but I do want to
7:54
get some writing except I've had two
7:55
non-writing days and I can't really
7:57
afford to have you know tons of no
8:00
writing days and get way behind because
8:01
it is already day seven and we are
8:03
already one week into Nano so I have a
8:07
little bit less than seven thousand
8:08
words so that's only an average of a
8:10
little less than a thousand words a day
8:12
and I need 1660 seven a day so now is
8:15
catch-up time and so I want to at least
8:19
get a thousand words a day and stick
8:20
with that kind of average today and then
8:23
tomorrow as long as I feel rested enough
8:26
and the kids are doing okay like Evie
8:28
really needed me today and I wanted to
8:31
be there for her 100 like
8:34
it's just the choices that we make as
8:37
parents or caregivers or Partners you
8:39
know it's like it's good to go go go
8:42
when you're inspired but there's also a
8:45
time that you need to just put the
8:46
camera down and rest which is why I
8:48
didn't record any of our dinner tonight
8:50
although it would be fun to show some of
8:52
that family time and show the kids more
8:55
I just wanted to be fully present with
8:57
them so
8:58
that was a very nice dinner they wanted
9:00
to celebrate mommy's speech so we had a
9:03
good time together and now I'm going to
9:05
pull out my laptop I'm gonna go set it
9:07
back up in my witchy room and I'm gonna
9:10
get just one or two sprints in and
9:12
whatever it ends up with I will be happy
9:14
with and then tomorrow hopefully we'll
9:16
get even more words
9:18
thank you
9:31
[Music]
9:51
foreign
9:56
guys okay I got I'm at 78 11. I
10:02
literally cannot math in my head so
10:04
we're gonna go to the Nano site and
10:06
figure out how many that is but I was at
10:08
62.63 so it's like 1600 words a little
10:11
bit less than 1600 hold on okay here we
10:14
are on the Nano site and I just love
10:17
their graphs and everything so I'm at
10:19
1548 for the day and it said I need 18
10:22
22 words a day now instead of 1667 or
10:26
whatever so that is really good because
10:30
that is really close to what I needed
10:32
today to catch up
10:33
so my path to success here on the Nano
10:36
site says I should be at 11 667 and I'm
10:39
at 78 11. so I'm about 4 000 a little
10:43
bit less than 4 000 words behind so not
10:46
too shabby
10:48
I'm tired but I'm happy that I stuck
10:51
with it to get it done tonight and I'm
10:53
glad so glad that I took last night off
10:55
of like vlogging and everything else
10:58
because it really is a balance and uh it
11:01
felt good today to get these words in
11:03
and I realized I just pulled up my
11:07
calculator again because again I'm not a
11:09
math in my head person uh which my son
11:11
is and it impresses the hell out of me
11:13
but anyway
11:15
I would need 21.89 words to hit 10 000
11:19
tomorrow and my 10 000 reward is that my
11:24
husband and I went on a date night a
11:25
week or two ago and I guess two weeks
11:27
ago now and we went to Daiso which was
11:30
my very first time ever going and I
11:32
literally bought like 200 worth of stuff
11:34
it was like 170 worth of stuff and it's
11:37
like stickers and washi tape and stuff
11:38
like that so my 10 000 reward is that I
11:41
get to pick out half of the items in
11:43
that bag and then my 20 000 reward is I
11:46
get the other half of those items so
11:48
some pretty exciting rewards so I'm
11:50
hoping that maybe I can get that
11:52
tomorrow so I need just over 2 000 words
11:55
and that would be super awesome and so
11:57
that's what I'm gonna aim for tomorrow
11:59
is 21.89
12:00
to let me know how you're doing let me
12:02
know if you have won any of your rewards
12:04
yet if you're giving yourself rewards uh
12:07
if you remember I said I get to buy an
12:09
iPad if I hit 50 000 so I am definitely
12:11
looking forward to that I really want to
12:13
be able to hit that and uh I don't know
12:16
I I feel overall in terms of how the
12:19
story is going that I still need a lot
12:22
of work on my idea I've been kind of
12:25
bouncing around so I've written the
12:27
opening chapters one through four and
12:30
then I did a couple flashbacks that I
12:31
don't know where they're gonna fit in
12:33
the story and then I did chapter nine so
12:37
I skipped a few chapters and I have a
12:41
feeling I'm gonna skip again because
12:43
there's a few things I'm just not sure
12:45
what I want them to do in between some
12:48
of this uh like getting to the cabin and
12:51
the first like First Act doorway so I'm
12:55
still kind of thinking on it so what I
12:57
do in this instance if I'm like I'm not
12:59
sure about some of this other stuff is I
13:01
just skip forward to scenes that I know
13:03
and I write them the best I can and then
13:05
what happens is once I write those
13:07
connecting scenes I often have to go
13:10
back and tweak and change the scenes
13:12
that I jumped ahead on but I don't have
13:13
to worry about that until edits I can
13:15
just make notes in my planner and say
13:17
okay chapter nine now needs to have this
13:20
thing changed about it but I don't have
13:21
to actually work on it right now and so
13:25
that is my process sometimes and I'm
13:28
hoping it works for me this time and I'm
13:30
hoping that at some point in the middle
13:32
of this mess the whole story will just
13:36
come flowing out of me but right now I'm
13:38
not gonna give up because I'm enjoying
13:41
writing more regularly and I'm really
13:44
really hopeful that this book will be
13:46
finished before the end of the year and
13:47
I'm just going to hold on to that hope
13:49
and keep working through so let me know
13:51
how your Nano is going so far I hope
13:53
you've been enjoying the Vlogs and
13:56
that's a wrap for day seven and week one
13:58
so my week one total is 7 811 words what
14:03
is yours
14:12
[Music]
[Music]
0:06
yeah
0:08
here's to the good days here's to the
0:11
Sorrows this is a mistake good morning
0:15
everybody day five of nanowrimo it is a
0:20
rainy day here in Houston
0:26
[Music]
0:32
[Music]
0:40
thank you
0:43
foreign
0:46
I have also decided again this morning
0:49
I'm kind of making myself at home here
0:51
to
0:53
order room service
0:56
and so I got coffee I got a yogurt
1:00
parfait and then I also got eggs and
1:04
then she brought me I did not order this
1:06
but she brought me a cheese danish and I
1:09
think a bagel too
1:10
because they forgot my coffee and so
1:14
they brought me extra things I guess
1:16
which was very nice so I am gonna enjoy
1:20
this I have been watching
1:23
the speakers this morning and I actually
1:27
really it's almost nine now or it's just
1:30
nine now and I actually was really
1:32
looking forward to hearing Russell and
1:34
Monica speak about Kickstarter but I
1:36
just couldn't get going early enough
1:39
this morning because it's too many late
1:41
nights and and too much energy
1:42
expenditure so I'm gonna watch for my
1:45
room but I'm gonna get this Vlog edited
1:47
first I'm gonna watch for my room and
1:48
then I'll go downstairs afterwards so
1:50
pretty chill easy morning I still have
1:53
some
1:55
um
1:55
tweaks to do on my own presentation for
1:58
tomorrow and I know I'm gonna have to be
1:59
up early so I'm just trying to take it
2:01
kind of easy but I do want to go
2:04
downstairs and enjoy the rest of the day
2:06
hello okay so it is already lunch time
2:10
it's 11 30 and I am just leaving the
2:13
room so here's my
2:16
day five outfit some boots tights Romper
2:21
I've been wearing a lot more red lately
2:24
because I am trying to kind of work on
2:26
my confidence and I feel like red is a
2:28
power color and I've been working on my
2:31
root chakra and trying to really just
2:34
step into this new version of myself I
2:37
know that might sound silly to some
2:38
people but it's just my thing right now
2:41
um so it took longer to get that video
2:44
done I kept having render errors like
2:46
over and over again but persisted
2:48
continued to troubleshoot got it done
2:50
and now I'm gonna go downstairs and get
2:52
some lunch and find my correct table for
2:56
today and yeah hopefully it's going to
2:59
be a great day I'll be back this
3:00
afternoon to finish up my presentation
3:02
and my slides and just keep moving
3:04
forward so day five of Nano day three of
3:09
RAM
3:10
water or maybe we just hit the end of
3:15
the road
3:16
right now it doesn't even matter
3:20
it's too late not to let it go
3:23
and that's why I wish you the best to
3:28
say goodbye
3:30
you start to get dressed and then we cry
3:34

information you can make it to a writing
4:01
conference definitely worth it
4:03
definitely worth it
4:04
it is 5 p.m and I have just spent the
4:08
last couple of hours working on my
4:10
presentation changing my slides up
4:11
really thinking now that I've been here
4:13
for a while like what is what do people
4:15
really need to hear uh after
4:17
conversations and things like that plus
4:19
there are so many people here that have
4:21
taken hb90 that I don't want to just go
4:23
over the basics so I'm changing up my
4:25
presentation a little bit I was not
4:27
expecting how many people had taken hb90
4:29
so
4:30
um yeah I was working on that and now
4:32
I'm gonna go have a drink with Becca's
4:34
time and hang out for a bit and uh it's
4:37
gonna be a fun evening
4:39
[Music]
5:08
thank you so much wow that's cool
5:12
[Music]
5:16
heading to dinner
5:19
[Music]
5:39
foreign
5:40
[Music]
5:52
hey I just got back from hanging out
5:55
with Becca I was I had dinner with a
5:58
Ness and a bunch of other friends dinner
6:00
or drink with Becca hanging out we keep
6:03
meeting up Becca and I
6:05
um everyone wants to talk with her so I
6:08
try to catch little pockets of her time
6:10
she's so amazing
6:12
um but it is now 10. and I need to go
6:17
over my presentation one more time which
6:19
is going to take about an hour so I
6:20
don't think I'm going to do a lot of
6:22
writing tonight I might still try to get
6:24
like 100 words so it's not a zero day
6:26
but
6:28
I'm going to open up my slides take off
6:32
my heels and I'm going to run through
6:34
this and hopefully I'm gonna be proud of
6:37
where I end up so
6:39
let's do this
6:40
okay so it is 1 30 in the morning
6:43
luckily the time changes and it will
6:46
actually go back to like 12 30.
6:48
I am not going to get any words in today
6:51
because I have been working for hours I
6:53
went through my presentation with my
6:55
husband on a zoom call and I'm still
6:57
tweaking things which is kind of typical
7:00
for me before a big speech I just want
7:02
it to be exactly what and it needs
7:06
everyone needs to hear
7:08
and so I'm still working in it still
7:10
practicing it still memorizing some
7:12
things and it's also been a little bit
7:14
crazy here because Houston Astros just
7:17
won the World Series and I'm literally
7:18
in Houston and so it has been non-stop I
7:22
should have recorded it earlier but it
7:24
has been non-stop like
7:26
honking and music and yelling and
7:29
revelry and other things so it's very
7:31
exciting if you're a Houston Astros fan
7:34
I used to be such a baseball fan I used
7:37
to I mean I grew up in Georgia and we
7:39
used to always go to Braves games and
7:40
stuff so
7:41
I am a baseball fan
7:45
however
7:46
it has been very difficult to focus and
7:48
go through my presentation with so much
7:50
noise so I've had my earphones and my
7:53
earbuds in
7:55
um but I just have not had time to write
7:58
I'm pretty exhausted after a really long
8:01
uh
8:02
in a few days
8:04
and uh tomorrow
8:08
we have to check out I have to check out
8:09
of my room at noon but I'm speaking from
8:12
9 30 to 11 and then there's another
8:15
speaker and then Skye is speaking and it
8:18
all goes until one and I don't want to
8:19
miss anything so I need to actually be
8:23
ready to have everything packed up
8:27
and
8:29
um
8:34
I need to have everything packed up and
8:36
take it downstairs the writing just did
8:38
not happen but good good news is I
8:40
actually got more done the first night
8:41
than I intended so I'm still gonna be
8:44
pretty much on track
8:46
um got a chance to do a little FaceTime
8:50
with the kids and Evie is feeling so
8:53
much better Andrew is feeling so much
8:55
better so I'm going home to healthy
8:57
feeling kids and that makes me very
8:59
happy and uh just super grateful to my
9:01
husband for going through the
9:02
presentation with me
9:04
and I'm tempted to go through it one
9:06
more time but then I'll be up till about
9:08
2 30.
9:09
but maybe it's worth it I just I want it
9:11
to be I want it to be really good so
9:14
uh that is that's the end of the day
9:17
five Vlog I feel like not as much
9:19
exciting stuff today in terms of
9:21
um the vlogging but
9:24
I'll be home tomorrow and we will
9:27
continue this journey so thank you for
9:28
hanging out with me at the romance
9:30
author Mastermind
9:32
um hopefully my speech is going to be
9:34
amazing tomorrow this has been a
9:37
wonderful few days just incredible the
9:39
energy the
9:41
just the speakers everything's been
9:43
incredible so I'm Gonna Leave feeling
9:46
inspired and I just hope I can be one of
9:49
those inspirational people as well so
9:51
I'm gonna finish up and get some sleep I
9:54
feel like I've just been wearing the
9:56
same PJs every night so this is my sign
9:58
off outfit and I will see you guys
10:00
tomorrow today's the day okay I've been
10:05
up I only slept like seriously four
10:07
hours because the Houston Astros won the
10:10
World Series and people were going nuts
10:12
outside and I could not sleep plus I was
10:14
like nervous I feel like my hands are
10:16
shaking this morning
10:18
I'm feeling better today but I woke up
10:21
excited for my message feeling like I
10:24
hope it's exactly what at least one
10:26
person in that audience today needs to
10:28
hear
10:29
I'm saying some things that I've never
10:31
said before and I hope that it resonates
10:35
I am
10:37
dressed in a brand new red dress today
10:39
wearing heels again so here is the daily
10:43
outfit
10:45
oh
10:46
I got nude heels to wear and we'll see
10:50
how it goes in terms of
10:53
um
10:54
staying in them while I'm speaking they
10:56
give us these little slippers in our
10:58
room I've never stayed in a hotel where
10:59
they give you slippers so I was tempted
11:00
to take those downstairs and slide them
11:02
on while I'm speaking I know it wouldn't
11:04
be very professional
11:05
but I just need to ground myself I have
11:09
a a couple of blue crystals like a Lapis
11:12
Lazuli and blue lace Agate and I'm
11:16
hoping to kind of hold those on the
11:17
podium with me today so that I can pray
11:21
that the words that need to come out of
11:22
my mouth are the words that everyone
11:24
needs to hear and that I'm able to find
11:26
those words because this is a is a big
11:29
moment and
11:31
I'm excited so
11:34
here we go final day

13:50
little bit after seven and it has been a
13:53
long drive an amazing day my speech went
13:56
so well I could not believe there was a
13:58
standing ovation and I was crying and
14:00
everybody's crying ah I just poured my
14:03
heart into that and I'm so glad that it
14:05
went well and I just pray it really
14:07
resonated with people
14:09
and then Megan and I drove home we
14:12
stopped at Cracker Barrel on the way
14:14
home and had just a
14:16
good some good lunch and then uh we met
14:21
back up at Bucky's I just didn't take
14:22
any video because I was like holding
14:24
onto my baby girl she was so glad to see
14:27
me and then we stopped and had dinner as
14:29
a family and we've just gotten home so
14:31
I'm gonna get her in the bath and we're
14:34
gonna
14:35
um
14:36
just hang out so you will probably if
14:38

14:41
Vlogs will probably go up on the same
14:42
day and I will just be a little bit
14:44

14:47

14:52

14:55
feels like 10.
14:57
I'm too tired to write too tired to get
15:00
my Vlog updated so I'm just going to go
15:04
chill with the hubs in bed and get some
15:06
sleep so I will get rest tonight I will
15:10
come back tomorrow and be ready to get
15:13
back to work
15:14
get back to my writing so I had two
15:16
non-writing days which isn't so bad
15:19
considering everything that was going on
15:21
so hopefully I can get some good writing
15:23
in tomorrow like I will anticipate
15:26
trying to get like another thousand
15:27
words or something tomorrow and then on
15:29
Tuesday hopefully getting back to kind
15:31
of my normal word count that's my hope
15:33
so I will see you guys tomorrow I hope
15:35
you had fun kind of watching some of
15:38
that romance author Mastermind
15:40
conference conferences like this are so
15:42
valuable not only for networking but for
15:45
getting Knowledge from people that are
15:47
gracious enough to share it and just
15:49
hearing other people's stories and for
15:51
that feeling of community so I highly
15:53
recommend them if you get a chance to go
15:55
to one someday and thank you to
15:58
everybody who was there and came up and
16:01
said hello it was so great to meet all
16:03
of you so I'm going to climb into my bed
16:05

16:27
cause I don't really need no more no
16:29
just wanna make it stop
16:35
water
16:37
or maybe we just hit the end of the road
I feel like it's becoming a nanowrimo
0:02
tradition to talk a little bit about
0:04
anxiety
0:05
[Music]

[Music]

0:50
good morning everybody day two or the
0:54
first official full day of romance
0:57
author Mastermind and I
1:00
struggled with anxiety this morning
1:02
pretty hard
1:03
when it happens to me it often happens
1:06
in the morning when I wake up and it's
1:08
just like nervousness in my stomach I
1:10
might have felt better if I had just
1:12
gone on downstairs but I also just
1:14
decided order room service watch the
1:17
presentations for my room and I'm so
1:19
grateful that they give us that
1:20
opportunity it's time now for lunch so
1:23
I'm gonna head down for that and the
1:25
lunch keynote speaker and I'm feeling
1:27
better
1:28
but this is just a quick reminder that
1:31
you can be healthy you can be joyful and
1:34
grateful and successful and still have
1:36
days where you wake up with anxiety you
1:38
can still have days where your past
1:40
trauma and your PTSD and your fears
1:42
start to overwhelm you a little bit it
1:45
doesn't mean that you're sick it doesn't
1:47
mean that you are a bad person or that
1:51
you necessarily even you know are
1:54
failing or anything like that it just
1:56
means that we all have bad days and we
1:59
don't talk about it enough so then we
2:00
think nobody else goes through this but
2:03
a lot of us go through it we're still
2:05
successful we pick ourselves up we put
2:07
our makeup on in our cute little jacket
2:09
and we keep moving forward so that's
2:11
what I'm doing today still nervous in my
2:14
stomach still heart racing a little bit
2:15
but I'm gonna move forward and I will be
2:19
back this afternoon to write I think
2:21
before dinner so I will catch up with
2:23
you guys then
2:27

2:54

3:45
Adrian we love you
3:49
[Music]
4:02
thank you
4:06
[Music]
4:22
hey everybody so it is a little bit
4:25
after 11 30 and I have just gotten back
4:27
to my room after a very long day but I
4:30
wanted to
4:31
talk I feel like it's becoming a
4:33
nanowrimo tradition to talk a little bit
4:36
about anxiety because you guys well know
4:40
that I have
4:42
um had a relationship
4:45
slash struggle with my anxiety
4:47
especially over the last year and a half
4:50
or so
4:52
and it is much better than it was this
4:54
time last year but then there are
4:55
certain things that bring out my anxiety
4:58
sometimes it's unexpected sometimes
5:01
there's no reason for it it's just I
5:03
wake up in the morning and I have knots
5:05
in my stomach and I feel literally ill
5:08
from it like it's a physical body
5:10
reaction and I Can't Tell You Why
5:13
um this morning I think I know why I was
5:16
feeling it one is because I stayed up
5:18
too late last night
5:20
I was up to one editing my Vlog getting
5:23
the writing done then I couldn't quite
5:25
sleep and my mind was racing and I
5:28
stayed up way too late
5:29
and that was not good for me because I
5:31
need my sleep
5:34
um the other one is because I think I
5:37
was not fully prepared and I don't want
5:40
this to come off as bragging because I'm
5:41
just trying to be honest I don't think I
5:44
was fully prepared for how recognized I
5:47
would be at this conference like I've
5:49
been to so many conferences in the past
5:52
and there's usually most people have no
5:54
idea who I am
5:56
um because most of those conferences
5:57
were before the pandemic which means
6:00
mostly before my YouTube channel had you
6:02
know but a couple thousand subscribers
6:05
and I think I just wasn't ready
6:07
for how many people would know me or how
6:10
many people here have taken my classes
6:11
or have seen my YouTube channel or heard
6:13
other people talk about me so there's I
6:17
it was just a little bit overwhelming
6:19
yesterday like in a good way because I'm
6:21
it means so much to me to know I'm
6:23
making an impact in the world and that
6:25
uh that has meant something to people
6:27
like I feel like that makes my whole
6:28
life worthwhile
6:30
um and I'm passionate about helping
6:32
people
6:33
but
6:35
I think there's also with the
6:38
combination of all the learning that you
6:40
do at something like this and how you
6:42
see all the other people like oh they've
6:44
been number one at this or they're the
6:46
best you know and you're learning all
6:48
these things and you're seeing all these
6:49
other people that have just gone huge in
6:52
their career
6:54
there's
6:56
a part of me I think this morning that
6:59
was feeling like
7:01
am I truly living up to my potential am
7:04
I doing everything that I need to do am
7:07
I really showing up a hundred percent
7:09
the very best person that I can be and
7:12
that's so much pressure to put on
7:13
yourself and I think that that's where
7:15
the anxiety was coming from of like
7:18
I gotta achieve faster I gotta do more I
7:21
have to
7:22
like earn this respect that I have from
7:27
all the people that are here that I
7:28
wasn't expecting it's like
7:31
I put was putting a lot of pressure on
7:33
myself to feel like kind of imposter
7:35
syndrome I think but to feel like I have
7:38
want to earn this and that I want to do
7:40
my very best and be my very best version
7:42
of myself and feeling that anxiety of of
7:46
wanting to
7:48
up level and like do even more you know
7:51
and that is part of the achiever like
7:56
high achiever High goal oriented type
7:58
person of myself and it's also just part
8:02
of my fear and I think that a lot of
8:04
people feel similar types of fear of
8:07
like if I don't if I don't do this now
8:09
or I don't
8:11
like be my very best self now then I'm
8:14
never gonna get there or have to do
8:16
everything as fast as possible and that
8:19
desire for Speed and to be transformed
8:23
overnight I think causes a lot of
8:25
anxiety for many of us so if you relate
8:27
to that let me know in the comments
8:29
um but I also think
8:31
it's important to talk about the anxiety
8:34
side of it just because it does affect
8:37
my writing and it's not debilitating for
8:40
me it doesn't mean there's anything
8:41
wrong with me or that I need help or
8:43
that I need to be pitied or judged
8:46
because there are a lot of people who
8:47
judge
8:48
for anxiety and that judgment a lot of
8:50
times is things like oh well she must be
8:54
in trouble or she must be unhappy or she
8:56
must not be grateful you know or
8:57
whatever but the truth is you can be
8:59
super successful and very happy and very
9:02
grateful and still have these moments of
9:05
fear or feeling like you're not enough
9:07
and
9:09
I just wanted to talk about that a
9:12
little bit just because
9:15
you know the way that I have been
9:17
dealing with it for myself that I think
9:19
I'm getting better at and
9:22
just kind of understanding is trying not
9:25
to judge myself because while there may
9:27
be judgment coming from other people I
9:29
don't want to judge myself like I
9:30
understand that I'm not a bad person or
9:32
that I'm not broken or that I'm not like
9:36
uh
9:37
you know
9:39
weak that I'm not a weak person I'm a
9:42
very strong person but I just have
9:45
moments where my body has a reaction and
9:48
a physical state that I can't fully
9:50
control and so what I've learned to do
9:53
when I wake up most of the time it's
9:55
happening in the mornings when I wake up
9:57
with this Panic or this anxiety and this
9:59
fear is I will put my hand over my heart
10:02
and I will say
10:04
I am safe
10:06
safe I am loved everything is okay
10:11
I am okay you know and I'll just say
10:13
that until I start to feel better I also
10:16
will just take it easy you know don't
10:18
have to hustle I don't have to lean into
10:21
the fear thoughts like I used to I think
10:23
allow myself to kind of ruminate
10:26
on
10:28
the fears like okay I'm gonna sit and
10:30
think about all of them and I'm going to
10:31
think about where I'm really not living
10:33
up and I really should be going faster
10:35
and now I hear those thoughts start to
10:37
cause the anxiety and I think no
10:39
I'm not gonna think about those things
10:41
right now instead I'm going to think
10:42
about how
10:44
I am safe and I'm grateful and
10:46
everything's gonna be okay and I talk to
10:48
myself like I would talk to someone that
10:50
I genuinely love
10:53
and
10:54
I will then nurture myself so that's why
10:57
I got a nice breakfast I took my time
11:00
getting ready I listened to the um the
11:04
zoom stuff so I didn't feel like I was
11:05
missing anything but I didn't have to be
11:08
like dressed and ready to go and like
11:09
pushing myself past a limit that I was
11:11
you know prepared to to go past so
11:14
nurturing myself
11:16
foreign
11:17
myself speaking to myself as if I were a
11:21
loved one that I was taking care of like
11:23
the way that I would talk to my son if
11:25
he was having a hard morning and trying
11:27
to you know love myself in that way has
11:29
made such a big difference
11:32
um and so once I got myself into a place
11:34
where I felt better and I got dressed up
11:37
and I got ready to go
11:39
um I had an amazing incredible day like
11:42
I love these types of writing
11:44
conferences because you get to meet
11:47
people you end up in situations where
11:49
you're like sitting next to someone at
11:50
lunch you weren't expecting to meet or
11:53
getting a chance to share your story
11:55
with somebody or to hear their story and
11:58
be impacted by that in some way and like
12:00
I had the amazing privilege of getting
12:03
to talk to Dylan Allen today who is just
12:05
incredible and is one of our hb90 alumni
12:09
and getting a chance to talk to Russell
12:12
Nolte I think is how you say his last
12:13
name and Monica Lionel who like Monica
12:16
has a son who's only a month younger
12:18
than Evie and Russell and Monica know so
12:22
much about Kickstarter and I really want
12:23
to do some Kickstarter so like we just
12:26
had the best time and I had so much fun
12:28
talking to them getting to talk to book
12:30
Pub and tell them like uh Carlin and
12:33
Danielle like how much
12:35
the difference they make in the author
12:37
community and getting to talk to them
12:39
about some strategies and stuff like
12:40
that talking to someone from the Amazon
12:43
team and hearing some of their feedback
12:46
and asking him questions like those kind
12:48
of opportunities don't happen outside of
12:51
these types of events sometimes and I'm
12:54
so grateful for that and
12:57
so I just want to throw it out there
12:59
that like
13:03
sometimes
13:04
we all are going to face potentially
13:06
anxiety or depression or just moments of
13:09
self-doubt moments of feeling left out
13:11
or like we don't belong or moments of
13:14
imposter syndrome or feeling like gosh I
13:16
want to be my very best version of
13:18
myself and maybe I'm not getting there
13:19
fast enough
13:21
um that you know in the end if we can
13:25
learn to love and accept ourselves as we
13:27
are that's going to help because you
13:31
really are and I really am we're
13:33
valuable human beings and we're stronger
13:36
than we think we are and we're worthy
13:38
but it's just sometimes these the
13:41
outside worlds and the trauma that we've
13:42
been through can can lie to us and make
13:44
us believe things that aren't true so if
13:46
we can learn to love ourselves and be
13:48
gentle with ourselves then sometimes we
13:51
can still get out there and have amazing
13:53
experiences and and ex you know
13:57
have these great opportunities and come
13:59
home and feel nothing but gratitude for
14:00
them and I'm hoping that I'll wake up
14:02
tomorrow feeling even better
14:04
um but that's kind of what's been on my
14:06
mind a little bit today and also
14:08
reminding myself that
14:11
success doesn't have to happen overnight
14:13
it doesn't have to happen fast I don't
14:15
have to be the number one person in
14:17
order to be worthy I just have to show
14:19
up as myself and that's good enough and
14:21
reminding myself of that allowed me to
14:23
go out and continue to have an amazing
14:25
day like I don't have to live up to
14:26
anyone's expectations I just have to be
14:28
myself and that is always going to be
14:30
good enough and
14:33
um that is true for you too you're great
14:35
just as you are so it's my little
14:38
anxiety spill for 2022 and uh it's
14:42
getting late but I do want to get a
14:44
little bit of writing in but I'm not
14:45
going to edit this blog until tomorrow
14:47
because I don't want to push myself too
14:48
hard sadly my sweet little Evie at home
14:51
is sick with what the stomach bug that
14:55
Andrew and I had last week so I was sad
14:57
to hear that because I know that this is
14:59
the longest I've been away from her I
15:01
think like three full nights and it just
15:04
makes me sad that I'm not there
15:06
um but I'm going to try to zoom with her
15:08
tomorrow and I know she was already
15:09
feeling better tonight so it's a new my
15:12
love to my sweet little girl
15:14
and uh I'm gonna get a little bit of
15:16
writing in it's raining here it's nice
15:19
uh I had an amazing day of opportunities
15:22
and connections and top it off with like
15:25
even 100 words or something would be
15:27
great and then I'll edit this Vlog and
15:28
get it up for you guys tomorrow so thank
15:30
you for all the comments keep them
15:31
coming let me know how your writing is
15:33
going and let's get some writing done
15:36
okay we're starting in at 55 22. I do
15:40
have my uh index cards here so I'm
15:44
writing a little bit out of order
15:45
because I want to write something that I
15:47
feel like will be easy to write after a
15:48
long day of a lot of brain stuff
15:52
um so I'm just kind of going through
15:53
even though some of this other stuff
15:54
ahead of it is not written yet
15:58
um just gonna see if I can pick out
16:00
something else that I want to write
16:05
um okay so here's a flashback scene with
16:09
Finn and Vanessa this would be a good
16:11
scene I think to write so I'm going to
16:12
finish out or I was thinking I hadn't
16:15
finished out the scene I was writing
16:16
yesterday which was another flashback
16:18
between Finn and Lorelei but I'm going
16:20
to write Finn and Vanessa scene even
16:23
though this is totally out of order and
16:25
I think it'll be easier on my brain so
16:27
this is just a little tip if you're
16:28
struggling um with the next scene in
16:30
your series or you've had a really rough
16:32
day and it's like a tough scene
16:34
try writing out of order if it works for
16:36
you could work for you that works for me
16:38
so let's do some writing
16:40
[Music]
17:04
okay so that is
17:07
741 words
17:10
for the day and uh technically it's it's
17:14
we're moving into day five because it's
17:16
after midnight but we're gonna count
17:19
this as day four my par should be 66.67
17:24
if I'm aiming for the 50k and I'm at
17:27
62.63 so I have now predictably fallen
17:31
behind about 400 words so
17:34
um I knew this was going to happen
17:35
tomorrow will probably be a little bit
17:37
worse falling behind
17:39
um and then Sunday again will be a
17:41
little bit further behind so I was aware
17:44
of it I planned for it and I'm hoping
17:46
that when I get home uh as long as the
17:49
kids are feeling okay I will have a few
17:52
really good days I'm going to be aiming
17:53
for more like 3 000 words on those days
17:55
when I get home uh but for now I
17:59
actually sat down and got some writing
18:01
in which 700 words is way more than I
18:04
was expecting to get
18:06
um so I'm happy with that but I'm tired
18:09
so I'm gonna take my makeup off I'm
18:11
gonna climb into bed and I'm gonna get
18:14
some sleep so
18:16
this is a final little message here to
18:19
you that whether you've gotten 100 words
18:22
so far this Nano or you're already past
18:24
ten thousand you're doing great as long
18:27
as you're continuing to work on your
18:28
story whether it's slow or fast don't
18:30
let speed cause anxiety just have fun
18:34
with your writing do the best you can
18:35
and keep showing up keep taking care of
18:38
yourself and everything's gonna be okay
18:39
so all right that was a fun little scene
18:42
and more writing tomorrow so I'll see
18:45
you tomorrow
18:47
for now
18:49

[Music]
2:05
hey you guys and welcome to Houston I
2:08
have just checked into the Four Seasons
2:11
my hair was curled earlier today but
2:13
this humidity right now the weather is
2:16
not cooperating we had an easy drive
2:19
down we picked up a couple of other
2:21
authors from the airport and now we are
2:23
here and I'm feeling all the nerves and
2:25
all the excitement but let me show you
2:27
my room
2:29
I'm telling you Skye Warren is first
2:32
class she runs the author Mastermind
2:34
romance author Mastermind and I cannot
2:36
believe how nice I mean of course I knew
2:39
the Four Seasons Hotel was going to be
2:40
nice but this room is nice the whole
2:42
event seems to be planned so beautifully
2:45
she just is incredible and I can't wait
2:47
to actually meet her in person
2:49
um so let me show you this room so you
2:51
walk in and I have this lovely little
2:56
sitting room here there's a little
2:58
coffee bar and some wine glasses and
3:02
everything here a little ice bucket and
3:04
then I have my bag here so there's a
3:07
closet right here
3:09
and I have a little sitting area right
3:12
here and a view of the rooftop pool of
3:15
the other hotel and then mostly just a
3:19
view of the city here of the buildings
3:21
next door and then I have a separate
3:25
bedroom here that is so lovely another
3:29
TV here and a nice big bright window
3:38
definitely loving having all the space
3:41
because this conference is packed in
3:44
terms of speakers and events and let's
3:47
check out the bathroom so here's my
3:49
little travel outfit I'm wondering how
3:53
I'm gonna do with boots on for the
3:56
entire or heels for the entire event but
3:58
hopefully it's going to go nicely so A
4:03
beautiful bathroom wow look at these
4:06
finishes and fixtures this is so
4:10
beautiful all marble tile
4:15
nice big shower look at just the tiling
4:18
on the floor I don't know that I've ever
4:21
stayed at a Four Seasons level Hotel
4:26
um so I am very excited to be here and
4:29
so so grateful I don't know if Skye
4:31
Warren watches my YouTube channel but if
4:33
she does if you're watching this thank
4:34
you so much for this opportunity and
4:37
this experience I'm just thrilled and so
4:40
feeling so grateful so this is going to
4:42
be super fun I'm gonna kind of freshen
4:44
up my hair and makeup and there is a
4:47
hospitality room that's open so I'm sure
4:50
there's people already kind of mingling
4:51
about in there so I'm going to go check
4:54
it out see if I can meet anybody I
4:57
already was approached by one of my
4:58
published and Thrive students in the
5:00
lobby which is really awesome it's just
5:01
gonna be fun to meet everybody so this
5:03
is gonna be fun
5:05
[Music]
5:07
foreign
5:11
[Music]
5:26
I am sitting at a um like a little
5:30
Meetup space before everyone's
5:32
registering and I found Katie which many
5:34
of you know is crafting really dreams
5:36
and let me show you what she brought
5:40
so this is the planner stuff and now I
5:43
feel like I did not bring enough stuff
5:46
conference so this is Katie and I you
5:50
guys know I love these Erin Condren bags
5:52
they're my favorite and I'm so sad I
5:54
didn't bring one so
5:56
if any hopefully you guys don't mind
5:57
being in my video so we have a whole
6:00
group of people here this is gonna be so
6:03
much fun
6:05
Megan says is this the planner table
6:09
and if you're standing on the sidelines
6:14
wondering why
6:19
foreign
6:23
[Music]
6:30
[Applause]
6:31
[Music]
6:38
[Music]
6:42
so it's about 10 30 at night I have come
6:45
back to the room and put on my PJs
6:48
definitely taking my heels off
6:50
it's definitely a mistake that I have
6:52
brought heels for every day and I meant
6:54
to bring one pair of tennis shoes I
6:56
forgot them so my feet are probably
6:59
going to be sore after this but what an
7:02
amazing keynote by Dylan Allen so
7:05
inspirational and so like just it really
7:09
hit me and that was such a great time I
7:12
had dinner with Becca seim and some
7:14
other amazing ladies some of which are
7:16
hearties which made me very happy got to
7:19
meet some amazing people and got to see
7:22
some old friends so that was all amazing
7:25
I got my name tag they did not have a
7:29
little
7:30
um like a little tag for young adults so
7:32
I need to make my own I put sci-fi
7:34
fantasy but I also should put paranormal
7:37
on there but tomorrow is a super super
7:40
packed day like events start breakfast
7:43
stuff starts at 7 A.M and the day
7:45
doesn't end until like 10 pm tomorrow so
7:48
I know that I need to Pace myself I'm
7:50
not not speaking until Sunday
7:52
and I feel super grateful that I have
7:55
this really really nice room because I'm
7:58
back to my room early enough now that I
8:00
can edit today's Vlog I can get some
8:04
writing done I have my computer set up
8:05
over there and then still get a decent
8:08
night's sleep so I'm only gonna aim for
8:10
about 500 Words tonight and that's gonna
8:12
be kind of my Max I think if I can
8:14
manage that even if I could just manage
8:16
100 words a night during this conference
8:19
I would feel really good but I forgot
8:22
how good it feels to be surrounded by
8:24
other writers in person I haven't really
8:27
been to a big writing event since like
8:30
rwa conference 2018
8:34
and it feels really good to see friends
8:37
to see faces from the heart breathings
8:41
community and to just know we're kind of
8:43
all in this together and that is really
8:45
cool and man it makes me really want to
8:47
have a hearties conference like a little
8:50
let's do a writing Retreat let's do
8:52
something in person super fun and it
8:54
just inspires me so now
8:57
I have all of my stuff sort of set out
9:01
here so that I can get a little bit of
9:04
writing done and then I'm going to do my
9:05
editing and then I'm gonna head to bed
9:07
so let's hope for 500 words I'm gonna
9:09
look one more time for my stand for my
9:12
camera and we'll see if I can prop it up
9:20
foreign
9:22
[Music]
9:38
[Music]
9:54
we can leave and run away someday
10:00
someday
10:05
[Applause]
10:07
okay so it is 11 10 and I haven't
10:11
counted up my words but I'm at 55 22
10:14
which is close to a thousand words so I
10:17
definitely got more than my 500 hopeful
10:20
words let me put this into the Nano site
10:24
and instead of trying to do math in my
10:26
head I will let it math for me
10:29
okay so we got 55 22.
10:35
[Music]
10:41
I got some badges going here
10:44
and let's see so if you want to see your
10:47
stats you can just go to my nanowrimo
10:49
and click on stats and it's going to
10:50
bring up this fun little
10:54
uh graph here so I wrote 919 Words which
10:59
is awesome way more than I expected okay
11:01
so par for today is 5 000 words and I am
11:05
at 55.22 so I am still technically a
11:09
little bit ahead of where I need to be
11:10
to hit the 50k but tomorrow most likely
11:13
I'm going to fall behind
11:16
um but I planned to fall behind because
11:19
I knew that this conference was going to
11:20
be all out so
11:22
this is why we plan ahead
11:25
I am going to um
11:28
catch up when I get home but as long as
11:31
I can at least touch base with my story
11:32
I'm going to feel really good about it
11:34
but I'm excited to be here I hope it's
11:36
going to be an amazing few days uh the
11:39
next couple days Vlogs might be out late
11:40
or they might be a little bit shorter
11:43
just because I'm not sure how much I'll
11:44
be able to actually Vlog while I'm
11:46
walking around but I will share as much
11:49
of the experience with you guys as I can
11:51
and
11:52
yeah I'm pretty excited so
11:54
it's 11 15. I'm gonna get some rest and
11:57
it's gonna be a really long and awesome
11:59
day tomorrow so uh happy day three

[Music]
0:34
good morning it is 10 30 on November 2nd
0:39
day two happy Wednesday it is wildly
0:43
foggy today so this is one of my
0:46
favorite spots in the new house
0:49
we don't have a lot of furniture out
0:50
here but I do have this nice egg chair
0:52
we've got some composting going on over
0:55
here and we currently have cows in our
0:59
backyard
1:02
see that little guy back there
1:05
through the fog and mist
1:09
it's very calm and peaceful So
1:12
eventually our dream is to get a pool
1:16
out here so that is going to happen
1:18
someday but for now we are loving it we
1:22
can see the sunset right back here in
1:24
the evenings and it's really peaceful
1:27
and nice out here
1:29
for now I have already started working
1:31
this morning I did some stuff with
1:33
invoices for the ordered paperbacks and
1:36
I started working on my nanowrimo
1:39
Diaries like the intro and getting
1:41
yesterday's Vlog edited which you guys
1:43
have seen by now and it's a busy day I
1:47
have a meeting coming up at noon which
1:49
is only about an hour and a half away
1:50
that I can't really talk about but it's
1:52
one of those meetings that's like I
1:55
don't know this could literally change
1:56
the trajectory of my entire life so it's
1:59
a pretty big one so I woke up feeling
2:01
excited and ready for the day to start
2:04
I'm also going to go get my nails done
2:07
oh should I use the smug one last time
2:11
I think I will
2:13

2:15

2:17

2:19

meeting and I'm going to try to keep
7:11
myself busy and get my Vlog up for day
7:13
one uh so that I'm not nervous it's a
7:16
big day
7:16
[Music]
7:44
life is good I'm just gonna say
7:46
life is so good you guys I
7:51
I have secrets
7:54
but
7:55
it's been a good day that meeting went
7:58
as well as just about anything I could
8:01
have hoped for and I'm excited for next
8:03
steps now I am working still on my
8:06
vlogging stuff I've got a pack I need to
8:09
get my nails done before I go
8:11
um tomorrow to Houston there's so much
8:14
to do but I'm gonna do it happy
8:18
foreign
8:20
[Music]
8:21
okay it's almost three and I'm just now
8:24
getting today's Vlog up so while that is
8:29
uploading I am going to work on packing
8:34
okay so I will be in Houston for four
8:37
days and
8:40
I have my outfits ready to go I'm
8:42
probably gonna try them on one more time
8:44
I'm nervous I always get nervous about
8:48
trips like this like am I wearing the
8:51
right stuff am I gonna look okay and
8:53
then I try to remind myself that like
8:55
literally everybody there is gonna be
8:57
more worried about themselves than me so
9:01
I'm gonna try to get packed up I have a
9:03
little girl here who
9:06
does not want to say goodbye to Mommy so
9:09
we're gonna be hanging out a little bit
9:11
while she watches some YouTube and crazy
9:15
enough we literally just had a cow have
9:18
a baby in our backyard uh we have cows
9:22
back there sometimes letting our
9:23
neighbor use our field and
9:27
we just watched a cow give birth so that
9:30
was really cool it's gonna be a really
9:32
long day and I still got to figure out
9:33
where I'm gonna fit my writing in so day
9:36
two and I'm already like I gotta get my
9:38
writing done Nails I went with white
9:42
[Music]
9:43
um
9:43
I'm way behind on everything I missed
9:46
dinner because of everything else that's
9:47
going on so I ate on my own
9:51
I haven't gotten any writing done today
9:53
it's day two come on come on this is a
9:57
pattern for me sometimes too though is
9:59
like if I have one really good day I
10:00
have a hard time having also another
10:02
good writing day right after it and so
10:04
one of my big goals for Nano once I get
10:07
back from this conference because it's
10:09
going to be difficult to write I'm not
10:11
usually somebody who would even attempt
10:13
to write during a conference so I'm just
10:15
gonna do the best I can uh in my Nano
10:18
like preptober
10:20
plan I planned on mostly taking these
10:23
days off not today I was supposed to
10:25
write today but taking the next four
10:27
days off so you know if I get any words
10:31
at all it's gonna be gravy but at the
10:34
same time I don't want to get super far
10:37
behind but
10:39
one of my goals when I get back from the
10:42
conference is to get into a routine and
10:45
try to develop a habit of writing you
10:49
know at least two days in a row if I
10:50
could just make that one step of having
10:54
a really good day two days in a row for
10:56
my writing that would be really nice and
10:59
I will consider that progress feeling
11:01
pretty tired and there's still a long
11:03
way to go in the night so just keep
11:06
moving forward
11:07
okay guys it's 8 30. I just got Evie
11:11
down
11:12
for bed I'm gonna miss her for the next
11:15
few days and it sucks that I really
11:16
spend as much time with her today as I
11:18
wanted Andrew who has been sick off and
11:21
on has a fever again I don't know what's
11:23
going on they're just passing it around
11:24
at school so uh trying to get him some
11:28
medication get him in the bath and I'll
11:30
go try to help him a little bit in a
11:34
minute but I really don't feel like
11:36
writing it's been a long day and I still
11:39
have all my packing to do and a bunch of
11:41
other stuff on my mind like my
11:42
presentation but this is what it means
11:45
to get the book done and I know that
11:47
over the past
11:49
you know year and a half this is part of
11:53
why the writing isn't getting done
11:54
because my life is really busy and when
11:57
you have two young kids at home or
11:58
you've got other responsibilities it
12:00
gets very difficult to find the energy
12:04
to just sit down and write and of course
12:06
there are times when you need to just
12:07
give yourself Grace and say tonight I
12:10
don't have time to do it but giving
12:11
yourself Grace for two years and then
12:14
never sitting down to write and having
12:15
it break your heart isn't really the
12:17
best solution either
12:19
um and so I'm I'm looking for that
12:22
solution and I'm trying to keep the best
12:23
most positive attitude so I'm pumping
12:27
myself up and in preptober I kind of
12:29
talked about transition rituals so this
12:31
is something I'm gonna do right now I am
12:34
going to turn on this little tivu
12:39
um little
12:41
speaker I'm going to turn on some good
12:44
playlist music that is going to pump me
12:47
up I'm going to light my
12:50
universe is my sugar daddy uh candle and
12:54
I'm going to set a timer and I'm going
12:56
to get going so I'm probably gonna just
12:59
get up and move kind of stretch and
13:01
dance for just a minute and then I'm
13:02
gonna start writing and I'm hoping that
13:04
that gets me pumped to go I may only do
13:08
an hour of writing but if I can get a
13:10
thousand words in I will be super happy
13:12
then I can finish my packing so uh
13:16
sometimes this is the beauty of
13:19
nanowrimo is that having that deadline
13:21
and that goal gets me going and helps me
13:25
to sit down and get the words in when I
13:27
know I want to and I need to even if I
13:30
don't feel like it so let's do this
13:32
[Music]
13:40
[Music]
14:07
[Applause]
14:09
[Music]
14:15
success okay it is so true sometimes
14:19
when you just sit down and get started
14:22
pick a scene that you feel like you can
14:23
see in your head that you know what's
14:25
going to happen and sometimes the words
14:27
will come so I ended up with
14:30
1720 words today I did three Sprints and
14:34
it took me about an hour I did three
14:37
like 20 minute Sprints though the last
14:39
one or the first one was a little bit
14:41
shorter so
14:43
um yeah 4603 is my total so I'm almost
14:46
to 5K already the next couple of days
14:49
are going to be a little bit tougher
14:52
um the next four days because I'll be
14:54
traveling but I am planning to still
14:56
spend a little bit of time in my hotel
14:58
room and hopefully not get too wrapped
15:01
up in the social part of it that I don't
15:03
actually get my work done because I want
15:06
to keep working on the plot of this I
15:09
want to keep staying in the momentum
15:11
that I've got going
15:13
and I want to keep writing so
15:18
successful day two I'm gonna go finish
15:21
packing and it's getting close to 10 p.m
15:25
so I'm gonna you know
15:28
wrap this puppy up day two
15:33
for me
15:37
foreign
15:41
[Music]
16:30
[Music]
hey everybody welcome back to Heart breathings it is editing time I have
0:05
already started editing my latest novel The Disappearance of Vanessa Shaw however I have not made as like big
0:13
strides great progress as I had hoped and I have had some struggle focusing so
0:19
we're going to talk today about the writer reset what my plans are for June and how I am going to finish the edits
0:26
of this novel and hopefully get it published this summer so let's get started [Music]
Beginning My Edits
0:36
so I don't know how many of you have potentially been going through something similar but for the last couple of
0:42
months I have had the most difficult time trying to focus and I don't fully
0:47
know what has made this different but getting into a state of flow and deep
0:53
work has been more difficult for me and I have also realized that I have let
0:58
some of my boundaries around my internet and phone usage get a little bit too
1:04
wonky some of my lines here so I am sort of doubling down for myself because I've
1:10
started to realize that while I can be distractible and still check emails get
1:15
my Facebook group stuff done even edit videos in a state of somewhat distracted
1:20
by my phone or other things that are going on it is extremely difficult for me to do
1:26
the Creative deep work that is needed to finish a novel and edit sometimes are
1:32
even more difficult in terms of the amount of deep focus and deep work they
1:37
require because there's so many decisions like now we're getting into the nitty-gritty details like the rough
1:42
draft has less stakes in some ways because it's like well I can always fix that later but now is later now is the
1:49
time where I'm meant to be fixing the book and sitting down to try to focus on the
1:56
decisions that need to be made have been extremely difficult for me so I'm adding
2:02
to my writer reset a concentration on deep work and what I can do to get myself into deep focus so this is going
2:12
to be particularly challenging because like many of you my summer is slightly
2:18
hijacked by having kids at home and I know not everybody here has kids but I will be doing a video coming up soon
2:25
about how to continue to work towards your goals during the summer even if your schedule has shifted because some
2:31
of you have more time over the summer some of you who are parents might have a lot less time over the summer or even if
2:38
you're unrelated to school or other things like that you might have different times in your year where your
2:44
schedule shifts due to different responsibilities or caretaking or even to your own health so I will have a
2:50
video coming up on that but for me I am trying to get myself to a place of
2:56
deep focus throughout the summer while also enjoying the heck out of time with
3:01
my kids my little girl who is three will be starting pre-k this fall right before
3:07
she turns four and it's going to be a life-changing kind of thing to have gone
3:13
from four years with a little one at home every day all day to having a little bit more of that time freedom but
3:20
I also want to enjoy as much time with her as possible and of course my son who will be finishing up fifth grade and
3:26
turning 11 this summer is also going to be home with us so I have created a schedule again I'll share that with you
3:32
guys later but my motto for this summer is work hard play hard I'm hoping to get
3:39
into deep focus so I can make the most of the time that I spend working but
3:44
also just really enjoy my time with them and have a good time this summer as well
3:49
so what we're going to talk about in today's video is really this is going to be an editing blog but I'm also going to
3:54
talk a little bit about that focus and I'm going to walk you through the steps that I'm taking to get myself into a
4:00
focused state to finish this book I would love to finish it in the month of June I'm not going to put any pressure
4:07
on myself by putting up a pre-order or anything like that however you guys can be my accountability let's finish this
4:13
book in the month of June let's do it I know I'm capable of it so let's talk about how I'm gonna accomplish that
My Editing Plan
4:21
okay so like I said one thing that has been coming up over and over again is a
4:27
lack of boundaries around my phone and internet usage my ability to focus has
4:33
been severely cut by my distractibility and I know that even though I have all
4:42
of my dings and notifications on my phones turned off that when
4:49
if this doesn't happen to me as much when I'm editing a video or checking emails or doing other things but when my
4:55
brain hits a point in the story or the work that feels difficult I also hit a
5:00
Wall of Resistance where my brain is like I don't want to have to make that decision right now why don't you just
5:05
check your phone and see if anyone's responded to that Instagram and it feels like because I'm posting on Instagram or
5:12
I'm answering people's comments or answering people's emails it feels like work it feels like I'm being productive
5:18
but I'm also sacrificing the things I want to accomplish most like making the
5:25
decisions getting the edits done for just sort of like temporary easy to
5:31
accomplish tasks that really could be done other times so I'm gonna be setting some boundaries by setting some app
5:38
limits on my phone I'm also going to be doing more focused Sprints I have shown
5:43
you guys this before I have this timeular device that I like to use for tracking my time I don't use it all the
5:49
time but I do use it sometimes but this device does not beep at me when my timer
5:55
is up it's like if I turn it to writing it will just go for hours and hours if
6:00
I'm writing and it has not been the most efficient way to track my time because if I want to use pomodoros which is
6:08
basically writing Sprints where I'm saying I'm going to work for 15 or 20 minutes or 25 minutes which is my
6:14
preferred time I'm going to write for 25 minutes without distraction and then I'm going to take a five minute break and
6:19
then write again for 25 minutes so we have a writing Community here on
6:24
Facebook and on YouTube called the heartbreathings writing community that the foundation of it is this type of writing Sprint which by the way we do
6:31
have our June double down day coming up this Saturday so I'll link that calendar down below We'll Be Live almost all day
6:38
Saturday in two hour increments doing 25 minute Focus Sprints as a group so if
6:44
you want to come join us I'll link that for you down below but I have found that when I'm trying to
6:49
do those sprints on my own I am using my phone to track the time
6:55
like setting my phone as a 25 minute timer and what happens is that even
7:00
though I have my dings and sounds turned off I can still see that I have a
7:07
message on Instagram where I can still see on the home screen that I have an email or a call or a Marco Polo or
7:13
something like that so if I'm casually glancing down to see how much time is left on my Sprint timer I am also then
7:21
often getting pulled into oh well let me go answer this quick Instagram and before I know it 20 minutes have gone by
7:27
and this is not the way I want to run my life it's not my intention to be on social media when I mean to be writing
7:34
and so I'm nipping it in the bud so to speak I am putting an end to it now and one of the things that I'm doing besides
7:40
the app timers and I'm going to be actually turning off notifications not just the sounds but the actual like
7:46
messages on my phone I also purchased this little Cube from Amazon I can't
7:51
remember how much it was as bills like maybe 10 or 15 dollars and they have them in different time increments the
7:57
good thing about this is that I don't have to use my phone at all now it doesn't keep a record of anything but it
8:03
does track my time just like a kitchen timer so this one has a five minute timer 25 minutes 15 minutes and 45
8:12
minutes and I like these time increments but you can get them in different colors and different increments but I like this
8:18
because I like to do 25 minute Sprints with a five minute break and then my longer breaks are typically 15 minutes
8:24
so I probably won't use the 45 minute one as much you can hear it beeping because I keep moving it but if I wanted
8:30
to set it for a 25 minute Sprint for example I would just turn it to 25 minute sorry if I wanted to set it for
8:38
25 minutes I would just turn it to where the 25 minutes is up and you hear it beep and then on the bottom it has a
8:44
timer that's running so I can just briefly look at it without being distracted by my phone to see how much time is left then it will beep at me
8:51
when 25 minutes are up and then I can turn it back to straight and then turn
8:56
it on to five minutes so that now I have a five minute timer running and that
9:02
will help me I hope string together more focused Sprints without having to ever
9:07
pick up my phone for a timer or go to a different web page for my timer so that's one big thing that I'm doing to
9:14
increase my focus another thing that works for me time and time again whether it's productivity or
9:20
tasks or writing is breaking things down into smaller chunks and I don't know why
9:27
I forget to apply this to my writing because I use this in my hb90 method all
9:32
the time which by the way if you're watching this when this video first comes out hb90 opens for enrollment this
9:37
weekend so definitely come back and look for that link I will link it for you down below but the registration will
9:44
open until Sunday at noon but that is opening up again so if you want to learn how to get more done come join us for
9:51
that but with my writing sometimes I forget to break things down into small
9:56
achievable tasks I do it all day long with my big projects like marketing and
10:02
videos and other things like that but the same can apply to our writing and
10:07
sometimes when I sit down and I start to think about my edits I'm just thinking about the entire novel and all the work
10:14
that has to be done and that starts to get super overwhelming so to improve my
10:19
focus and my joy and my ability to get things done I'm gonna be breaking it down into smaller segments of tasks so
10:27
first instead of thinking about the entire novel I'm just gonna start my edits with act one so let me tell you
10:34
about what I've done so far in the editing process since it's been a few weeks since my last writer reset video
10:40
and then you're gonna follow me through the next steps
What I've Done So Far
10:45
so the first thing I did was a post draft brain dump this was literally just
10:51
sitting down I think I sat down for about an hour and a half to two hours and I just wrote out all my thoughts
10:56
about the rough draft and the story so far what I think needs fixing what I feel like was really good where I think
11:02
things are going and where I need to focus and this ended up being about 5 000 words of just basically stream of
11:08
Consciousness and it was really helpful to me to understand sort of where my weak points are and what I feel like was
11:14
going well about the book another thing that I did was I went to went out to a
11:20
coffee shop I had one of my larger note cards which is maybe like a five by seven note card and I wrote out what the
11:28
major plot points of the novel so on this part I was focused on the entire book start to finish but I was only
11:34
focusing on those major turning points so for me this is the opening scene and the hook the first doorway of no return
11:41
and then the midpoint the climax and the resolute solution so I just wanted to
11:46
make sure that I had those nailed down in the present timeline because I've got dual timelines in this book and I wanted
11:53
to make sure I was really clear on that and exactly what's happening and what that does is it gives me a road map to
11:58
follow like I know at the beginning of the novel where I'm heading and that is one of the advantages to finishing your
12:04
rough draft is often you start to know at least what the path you're following is even if you don't have all the dots
12:10
yet connected so I did all of that work I got those big note cards done and that
12:17
felt pretty good I also started reading some books that have split timelines or dual timelines so for example the book
12:24
that I'm reading right now is called the broken Girls by Simone St James it is excellent she is such a great writer and
12:30
I've heard amazing things about this book in the past and it is not disappointing me now what she does in
12:36
this book for the majority of the beginning of it as dual timeline is it's literally just alternating you have one
12:42
in the present day one in the past one in the present day one in the past and each one in the past is from a different
12:48
girl's point of view and that really works for this particular story I'm going to potentially experiment with
12:54
that in my own because that's one of the biggest questions that came up in my post draft brain dump is how am I going
13:02
to weave these two timelines together in a way that makes it most effective so
13:07
I'm gonna experiment with this of just simply alternating it and seeing how that feels but sometimes it can be super
13:14
helpful when you get to the editing phase the drafting phase at any phase to pick up books in your genre or this
13:21
isn't even a why a book that I've been reading I've read multiple split timeline books at this point and none of them have been young adults they're not
13:27
exactly in my Niche or genre but they are Mysteries so they're adjacent and
13:33
they're giving me ideas even though the stories are very different from my story it's giving me ideas as to the author's
13:39
process and what works in storytelling and what doesn't so sometimes reading can be effective in your edits next I
13:46
did something that I had started working on before I even finished my rough draft which is created an outline of all of
13:53
the scenes and chapters that are currently in my rough draft now mine are not in order like they normally would be
14:00
with the chronological book that follows you from point A to point B without ever like splitting off to different
14:06
timelines so I have large chunks of the present day timeline and then I have
14:11
like a huge section like 40 000 words that's all past timeline and none of it
14:17
is in order of how it's going to be when I start alternating things so it's a bit
14:22
of a mess but I went through and I made that outline so I knew exactly what scenes I had already written and made a
14:29
list of scenes that I know I want to write that were not yet written yet so this helps me to identify the holes of
Act One
14:37
what I have and what I still need to write okay
14:42
so that brings me to today so what I'm going to be working on today is I'm
14:48
going to take my graph paper so this is just a huge pad of graph paper I think
14:54
it's like 11 by 17 but I will link this for you I got it on Amazon I know you can also get this kind of graph paper at
15:01
Office Depot I'm pretty sure probably Staples and other places like that but it is just graph paper it has blue lines
15:09
to it it's really nice and what I'm going to do is I'm going to section this off into act one act two part one act
15:15
two part two and act three so four sections of the book and I'm going to start working on the timeline and above
15:22
the line I will write out anything that's happening in the present tense timeline below the line I will start to
15:28
write anything that is alternating scene by scene in the past timeline I'm also
15:34
going to take a brand new set of note cards and I'm going to begin to write out everything I know about each of
15:40
those scenes in terms of what's the overview of the scene what's my character's goal in that scene what is
15:47
the conflict and what's standing in their way and what what's the resolution how does it end up that's going to be
15:54
mostly for the present day scenes for the scenes in the past I'm going to get into the nitty-gritty of how does this
16:00
tie into the present timeline and what like who knew about this I'm gonna make
16:06
sure that I mark on my cards which of the characters at the cabin the night Vanessa disappeared knew about this
16:12
event and who was it a secret for because that's going to play into the mystery as well so I really want to get
16:18
clear on those details so basically at this point when I say that I'm going to be breaking this down into smaller tasks
16:24
what I'm going to focus on starting today is only act one so I'm going to set up this grid I'm going to take my
16:30
note cards but I'm only going to focus on act one and I'm going to take those notes that I have about the beginning of
16:35
Act One the hook the inciting incident and where Act One ends up the first doorway of no return which is the a key
16:43
event the thing that locks our character into the main story which in this case is we have characters who know at the
16:50
beginning of the story that Vanessa disappeared a year ago that's the inciting incident is that Vanessa disappeared and no one ever saw her
16:56
again they're coming back to this cabin one year later to celebrate graduation and to kind of Honor Vanessa's memory
17:03
and really the main character Lorelei is looking for some kind of closure as to
17:10
what really happened to Vanessa because she has carried for the past year a lot of guilt and doubt about being the last
17:17
person that saw Vanessa alive that night and so it becomes a mystery with our
17:23
sort of amateur Y.A sleuth trying to decide um or trying to figure out really what
17:29
happened so that she can find closure and move on with her life and so by the time we get to the doorway of no return
17:35
we have an event happening at the cabin where they lose power and they're
17:40
basically stuck on this island sort of by the river where they can't get off
17:45
until tomorrow so they're going to have to survive the night and they don't know whether what's happening to them is
17:52
Paranormal is it Vanessa's ghost come back to haunt them or is whatever person
17:58
potentially killed Vanessa coming back to finish the job and so there's danger
18:03
there's mystery there's a lot of conflict a lot of suspense a lot of drama and I just want to focus on that
18:10
piece of the path what is you know this part of the puzzle here this top and so
18:17
part of what I'm going to do is I'm about to just go out to a coffee shop for a couple of hours I'm going to take my blank graph paper and I'm just going
18:24
to work on those questions what are the scenes that are happening in act one only starting with the very first scene
18:29
I'm not going to be editing or rewriting anything I already have yet I'm just going to be working on the order of scenes and the trajectory of what
18:37
happens in each of those scenes then when I come home I'm going to transfer all of that onto this now you can see
18:42
this part of my plot wall is already pretty well finished however a lot of
18:49
this stuff is going to change because in the edits I'm realizing you know things need to move around a little bit so I'm
18:55
going to figure all that out I'm gonna come back I'm gonna put it on the wall and then what I'm going to tackle tomorrow in tomorrow's session is I'm
19:02
going to actually create a new document that is brand new Clean Slate nothing on
19:08
it yet and I'm just going to copy it chapter by chapter so I'll start with the prologue I will fix and rewrite the
19:14
prologue based on the things I decide today and then once prologue chapter is done I will go back to my original rough
19:21
draft I will copy chapter one or whatever I feel like is the right chapter to grab and I will begin
19:27
rebuilding a second draft from that first draft when I hit any scenes that
19:32
have not yet been written I will write them and that's the way I'm planning to work through my edits is scene by scene
19:37
chapter by chapter and not worry about where it's going to end up at the end just yet I'm just gonna break it down to
19:44
one tiny step at a time and I'm gonna do it in 25 minute chunks or pomodoros and
19:50
I'm hoping that by the end of June this entire thing will be done but I'm going
19:55
to just take it one day one step at a time and not overwhelm myself so let's grab this graph paper and let's head to
Coffee Shop Trip
20:01
the coffee shop [Music] Show Me Love this is
20:09
[Music]
20:19
[Music]
20:27
[Music] this is
20:32
[Music]
20:41
sometimes life will push you down make you fall on through the ground
20:49
but I know you will turn it around oh this is all we got
20:57
interference [Music]
21:10
oh this is
21:21
we can wait for better days but the days won't come hello again so it is the next
Another Day of Edits
21:28
day and I'm continuing on with edits I got Evie in here in my office she's doing a little bit of coloring with me
21:33
so here's how far I got I kind of have things spread around on the floor but
21:40
let me turn this video around so yesterday at the coffee shop I had already done some of this plot work and
21:47
I started working on my timeline so as I had mentioned I'm only working on act
21:53
one but I took this grid paper and I just did counted four blocks and then
21:59
four blocks below so above and below the timeline and then I put a bonus block
22:04
here and then four blocks four blocks another four blocks and so on so I've got act one two part one two part two
22:10
and act three and then a little bit of space here at the bottom of course Gotta Throw Some washi tape on there
22:16
but I am basically figuring out how I'm alternating and so far you can see it's
22:22
all in purple so this is all lorelei's point of view but I'm about to add in my
22:29
first non Lorelei POV here in the past so I'm going to start using some other
22:34
color and then I'm going to start weaving those in so that's basically all I got done
22:39
except that I also worked on my note cards so on my note cards I did put a
22:46
goal and I like to especially once I've finished my rough draft to have a basic
22:52
idea of about how many words I'm working with in each act so if you have a novel
22:58
that is let's say 90 000 words and you divide that by four you're going to end up with about 22 500
23:05
words for each Act I'm not exactly sure how this will look once it's all edited
23:11
so I'm giving myself between about fifteen thousand and twenty two thousand words for this act and just knowing from
23:18
experience how much how many scenes that is for me and how much room that is to
23:24
get to the point so I know where I'm starting which is part of why I filled out some of these plot points I know the
23:31
hook and the opening scene and I know where I'm going so that gives me the trajectory in the road map then to
23:38
understand how many words I have on average to get there now this is not obviously something everyone needs to do
23:44
you might just follow your intuition and it works out great but I do like to make sure that my act 1 climax happens
23:52
between 20 and 25 into the book so I just like to keep an eye on my word
23:57
count but then I stay flexible if it ends up being a little bit long or a little short but I'm just trying to keep my eye on the pacing once I get to the
24:04
editing I'm starting to focus more on those kind of details now in these
24:10
actual note cards I've mentioned this before that I start
24:15
with an overview of the scene the goal of the scene in terms of the character's goal the conflict that's keeping them
24:22
from their goal and then what's the outcome did they achieve their goal did something come up did the conflict
24:28
create a new like goal for the character and so on and part of the reason I don't
24:33
always do this in my rough draft but part of the reason I do this in my edits is
24:39
multiple reasons for me one being that I can make sure that whatever the outcome
24:44
of this scene is naturally leads us into the next scene because often something
24:50
will shift or change in this scene from what the character expected which then sends them on to the next scene and what
24:56
the conflict is there like a new conflict they're dealing with new information they want to get new relationship stuff so it it helps me
25:04
figure out the flow of the plot another thing is the goal because this is not
25:10
about my goal as a writer sometimes I will write that for example like this on
25:16
the back I'll say my goal as a writer is to introduce such and such to the reader
25:21
but the character will have a goal in the scene and part of the reason that I like to focus in on this in my editing
25:27
note cards is because this informs my character Arc what is this
25:35
character's goal in talking to this person what is this character's goal in showing up at this cabin after a year
25:40
what is she hoping to accomplish in this scene and for this character this first scene for Lorelei in the present day
25:46
timeline is to really decide like does she want to go through with this does she want to stay and she's sitting there
25:52
behind the bridge kind of like the bridge is a gateway into no turning back
25:58
for her in a way and she knows that this is her chance to really decide do I go
26:03
and see these people I haven't seen for a year and start to really find closure with Vanessa's disappearance or do I
26:10
just turn around and go home so that's her goal and me knowing what her goal is in completing this action and walking
26:17
through the scene helps me to know what type of interior monologue this character is going to have what is her
26:23
motivation in talking to people how is she going to approach conversations how she going to approach information what
26:29
is she going to be feeling what do I want the reader to be feeling and it just makes everything more clear then
26:36
when I know what the conflict is and the outcome it makes me it gives me so much
26:41
clarity about when I go back to these scenes to edit them I can really
26:47
uh tighten up the character Arc the motivation the feelings the emotions and
26:52
what the reader is seeing I can't always focus on that when I'm writing the rough draft because I'm just trying to get the
26:57
story on the page so this type of process where you know I've got kind of a messy story on the page but now I'm
27:04
beginning to structure it a little bit more tightly this is where the magic is
27:10
for me and this is why I love edits is because it starts to make everything clear and every time I clarify
27:17
a little bit more of what's going on inside the character's interior mind and their feelings and how they're
27:23
approaching things and ramping up that conflict it just allows me to kind of
27:29
guide the book a little bit better and I love it so I did get quite a few of
27:35
these note cards done and I'm pretty excited to have made that much progress
A Big Moment
27:40
in just one afternoon session the other thing is this moment right
27:45
here so that moment was me
27:52
feeling like a piece of the story got unlocked and I've talked about this so many times but it is for me one of the
27:59
most fun magical exhilarating parts of being a writer and it has legitimately been about two years since I felt this
28:05
feeling and I missed it which is the feeling of something unlocking you know
28:12
like you're at your locker you're putting in the lock the combination a couple of different times and it didn't come open and then you feel that last
28:19
little piece fall in and you pull it down and it unlocks taking me back to high school I don't
28:24
even know if lockers are still like that anymore but that for me is the feeling when a story unlocks and sometimes for
28:30
me it is an image sometimes it's uh like a scene playing in my head like a movie
28:37
and sometimes it's a Twist that I hadn't figured out until that point and I'm
28:43
telling you that moment at the coffee shop yesterday when I you know I told you I had finished this rough draft but
28:49
it's really rough and part of the biggest issue still in my mind about this rough draft is how am I effectively
28:56
going to weave the past timeline in with the current timeline and make it really interesting and a lot of tension and
29:02
conflict and twists and turns and it just hit me like a ton of bricks
29:07
yesterday and it was so satisfying and so much fun and I'm just gonna give you
29:13
a bit of encouragement here that if like me for the past couple of years you have been struggling to find your magic your
29:19
joy the excitement of writing I promise you you have not forgotten how to do it you have not lost your mojo you haven't
29:26
lost your own magic you have it still if you have ever had it or if you've never
29:31
found it if you feel drawn to it you still have that magic and I know that
29:38
you can find it again if you feel like it's time just allow yourself to have fun with the
29:45
story again go back to the things that were fun about writing when you first discovered it for me it's been clearing
29:53
up my space clearing up my calendar I haven't been growing as fast on YouTube but man it is worth it to slow down
30:00
sometimes so that I can get back to my joy and I know that that is going to accelerate things in the long run and I
30:07
have held the faith now for two months that this writer reset of getting back to my joy cleaning up my space creating
30:13
room in my brain trying to get into a better focus mode I have had the faith
30:18
that it was going to pay off and I feel like yesterday proved that it is so edits are going well I'm going to
30:24
continue working on it today but that is the progress I have made so far and I'm excited to continue on with this so I'm
30:31
happy nanowrimo
0:03
we're here we made the decision we made
0:06
the commitment and today is the day
0:09
nanowrimo here we go

[Music]
0:19
[Music]
0:27
thank you
0:37
[Music]
1:01
it was late
1:03
[Music]
1:04
wow what a difference a year makes this
1:08
time last year we were about to get back
1:10
on the road we did not have a home for
1:12
our family we were traveling all around
1:15
life was an adventure but it was so
1:18
stressful and I am so grateful I woke up
1:21
this morning so grateful for my home for
1:24
my family and for my community and the
1:27
ability to sit down and hopefully finish
1:30
a book this month I feel like my heart
1:33
is totally full because I have
1:36
decided to to let go of the pressure of
1:40
past failures like it has been heavy on
1:43
my heart for a while now that it has
1:45
been a over a year almost a year and a
1:46
half since I've finished a novel and I
1:49
just decided kind of last night and
1:51
today when I was doing some journaling
1:53
that I'm gonna Let It Go
1:57
I'm gonna take it off my shoulders and
2:00
just let it go that this was a rough
2:05
year of transition and I can start fresh
2:09
right now and you can too so whether
2:11
you've fallen short of Nanos previously
2:14
whether you've been going through a lot
2:16
over the last year or more or whether
2:18
you abandon your writing and you're just
2:19
coming back to it or whether you've
2:21
never been able to believe in yourself
2:23
before and now you're finally following
2:25
your dreams this is the year we get a
2:27
fresh start right now today let's do
2:30
this a new chance to write our books to
2:33
make our dreams come true and I'm ready
2:35
for it so before I can get started
2:37
writing today though this is the way it
2:39
always is I need to get this room
2:42
cleaned up in the month of October I
2:44
celebrated 12 years since my very first
2:47
book came out beautiful demons and we
2:50
always do this Fan event called the
2:51
Spooktacular and it's a lot of work a
2:54
lot of videos a lot of giveaways and my
2:56
when I do a lot of work like that I tend
2:58
to just get untidy it's the way way of
3:01
my personality and so I've got not only
3:04
decorations up everywhere I've got stuff
3:06
all over the floor and I just need to be
3:08
able to have this room in particular
3:11
where it's going to be my main like
3:13
writing Focus room to be tip top shape
3:16
ready to go so
3:18
I'm going to work on that then I'm going
3:21
to get started on this wall behind me
3:24
because I want to put up I have been
3:25
making Post-it notes and stuff for that
3:27
wall but because it's been decorated you
3:30
can kind of see it even though it's
3:31
blurry here I have not been putting
3:33
stuff up so if you are new to my channel
3:37
to the nanowrimo Diaries quick
3:39
introduction my name is Sarah Cannon I
3:42
am a self-published Indie author I write
3:45
mostly young adult fiction a little bit
3:47
of college age new adult fiction mostly
3:49
paranormal and fantasy and the book that
3:52
I'm going to be working on this year is
3:54
called The Disappearance of Vanessa Shaw
3:56
which is a why a paranormal Thriller
3:58
it's a standalone which I've never
3:59
actually written a full Standalone novel
4:01
before so this is fun uh it's also not a
4:04
brand new project I started working on
4:06
it in 2019 and then have been kind of
4:09
reworking it and getting edits done but
4:11
I'm starting the month with 8 000 words
4:13
so of course that doesn't count towards
4:15
Nano so minimum I'll end with 58 000 in
4:19
the manuscript so the 50k is kind of the
4:23
goal but secretly on the back end my
4:26
real goal is to actually finish this
4:28
novel whatever it takes could be about
4:30
70 to 80 000 words can I do that in a
4:33
month where I'm also busy and speaking
4:35
at a conference
4:37
I don't know I'm actually speaking at
4:40
two conferences this month
4:42
I don't know but I'm gonna try and I'm
4:45
excited for the opportunity and I'm
4:47
gonna try to let everything from the
4:50
past go all the struggles of the past go
4:52
and instead of saying I've been
4:53
struggling with writing I'm gonna watch
4:54
my words right now and I'm gonna say
4:57
I love writing I'm grateful for the
5:00
opportunity to write and I'm going to be
5:01
working on this book and I'm really
5:03
excited for it it's multiple point of
5:05
view it's multiple timeline it's gonna
5:07
be super fun and I love this type of
5:10
book when I'm a reading you know and I
5:12
just think I'm gonna love writing it but
5:14
I haven't gotten into flow yet so I'm
5:16
ready I'm ready for that so part of the
5:18
work I'm going to do today is getting my
5:20
space cleaned up I have my plotting
5:22
notebook is all set up with my preptober
5:25
stuff and my plotting notes and my word
5:28
count trackers and everything I'll
5:30
probably show you guys a peek inside
5:32
this a little bit later in Nano like a
5:35
few days in and I'm gonna get this
5:37
plotting wall set up the room all
5:39
cleaned up and then I'm going to start
5:41
writing my friend Jen is already waiting
5:43
for me on Zoom so I'm gonna log in with
5:47
her and probably do some cleaning
5:48
Sprints while she's writing uh Jen is
5:51
one of my oldest friends we met in
5:52
nanowrimo 13 years ago at a write-in so
5:56
you never know when you can meet some of
5:57
your very best friends through Nano but
5:59
I'm so glad that you're here nanowrimo
6:02
Diaries
6:04
let's do this y'all we got this
6:06
[Music]
6:18
so if you guys are new to my Vlog this
6:21
is my sweet little girl what's your name
6:24
uh Sonic your name is Sonic what what's
6:28
your real name
6:30
[Music]
6:33
I'm staying in this moment so it's hard
6:37
sometimes
6:38
[Music]
6:57
foreign
7:02
friends
7:05
[Music]
7:36
making you a memory that's really all I
7:40
need
7:40
[Music]
7:52
In This Moment
7:56
[Music]
8:01
okay guys it's already 12 30 and I have
8:06
finally gotten this room into a good
8:08
space so I have light I have not had
8:11
light in this room for over a month and
8:13
I've got my writing space here I do have
8:16
two keyboards in case I want to switch
8:18
it up in terms of the feel of things
8:20
I've got a speaker a TV speaker here
8:23
that I love I also have
8:27
these little Pebbles which I used during
8:30
Camp Nano which each one represents a
8:33
hundred words and right now I have I
8:36
think 2 000 words in here 20 of these
8:38
Pebbles but I want to have 28 so I'm
8:41
going to find a few more and fill that
8:43
up I also have I have a candle so this
8:47
is one of the little tricks that I
8:49
sometimes will do when I'm starting a
8:51
new book is I will grab a candle that
8:53
sort of ritualizes the writing process
8:56
where every single time I sit down to
8:58
write one of the first things I do is
9:00
light the candle so I'm going to be
9:01
using this one the universe is my sugar
9:03
daddy this is from Luna love because I
9:06
am really asking the universe to come
9:08
through with some words let me open this
9:10
up I love these candles from lunum Love
9:13
and this one smells so good and it has
9:16
glitter and lots of little crystals and
9:18
things in it and I am going to light
9:21
this up and keep this by my desk now
9:24
obviously I don't use this when I'm out
9:26
at a coffee shop or whatever but I will
9:28
use it when I'm here in my room and
9:31
that's going to be my kind of ritual
9:32
candle I have a few minor little things
9:35
to clean I need to clean the floor in
9:37
here but otherwise we are ready to rock
9:40
and roll so this is perfect I'm gonna go
9:42
have lunch with the family and then I'm
9:45
going to start writing so I'm I'm a
9:48
little bit nervous to be honest okay
9:50
lunch has been had now I am going to
9:53
I've just taken like a little bit of a
9:56
final sweep through the room and kind of
9:59
tidied things up I also grabbed some
10:02
more of those little Stones I have 28 of
10:06
these little beads in here and when I
10:09
sit down to write if I get 300 words
10:11
I'll move three of these Pebbles over
10:15
and hopefully by the end of the day this
10:18
one will be empty and this one will be
10:20
full so that's part of that plan I also
10:24
have printed out some of my old pages
10:27
that I'm still kind of editing and
10:28
looking through
10:30
and I have my plotting wall is kind of
10:33
freed from the balloons and everything
10:35
else I've got a lot of my little
10:37
plotting supplies and color-coded stuff
10:39
here I have a big pad of graph paper
10:42
that I've been using for the timeline
10:44
for this book so I'm going to continue
10:45
on with that because there's three
10:46
separate timelines that are a little bit
10:48
difficult to keep or figure out how I'm
10:52
going to weave them in and out so I'm
10:54
going to spend some of the rest of the
10:55
day filling out
10:57
some of what I know is going on this
10:59
wall I've been putting together some
11:00
Post-it notes already for some of the
11:03
scenes I'm also going to print out on
11:05
some sticker paper some visuals that
11:09
will remind me of some of the major
11:11
scenes and what the cabin looks like and
11:12
things like that which I like to put up
11:15
on my board but overall this room feels
11:17
brand new because it has been so
11:20
cluttered and dark for the past month
11:22
and it just feels so good and I love
11:25
that fresh energy so if you have been
11:27
like feeling uninspired for Nano I
11:29
highly recommend take a moment and clear
11:32
out a space whether it's by your bed or
11:37
by the couch or the kitchen table or if
11:39
you have your own space in your own room
11:41
just getting that fresh clean makes all
11:43
the difference and now I feel inspired
11:45
to get this done
11:47
in the meantime I have enlisted my
11:50
husband George's help because I have
11:55
almost 600 books got ordered during my
11:58
Spooktacular so you guys are going to uh
12:00
see me sign those because I'll probably
12:03
be covering that some in the Vlog so he
12:05
is currently weighing each of my books
12:08
so that we can get an estimate of how
12:12
much the shipping is going to be
12:13
internationally because it's going to be
12:17
expensive I know so he's weighing each
12:19
one he's helping me out so I need to
12:21
make the most of the time that he is
12:23
giving me and Andrew is currently
12:26
watching Evie and they are hanging out
12:28
so I'm gonna get some work done
12:31
all right let's set up this wall I find
12:34
that I'm having a little bit of nerves
12:36
because like I said in the beginning of
12:39
this Vlog I'm ready to move forward and
12:42
stop thinking about the regrets of the
12:43
past but as much as I want to get into
12:46
that mindset there is still a little
12:48
voice in the back of my head that says
12:50
you you're hardly a writer anymore you
12:52
haven't been showing up people are
12:54
disappointed you know all of those sort
12:56
of negative thoughts that tend to creep
12:59
up when you're trying to make change or
13:01
when you're trying to go for a big goal
13:02
so I'm feeling a little bit of that it's
13:05
like no I'm not going to listen to it I
13:07
keep kind of telling that voice in my
13:09
head no I hear you but we're not doing
13:12
that right now what we're doing is we're
13:14
getting excited we're moving forward
13:15
we're finding New Paths ways we're
13:18
creating new excitement for the future
13:21
we're not going to listen to the past
13:23
that said you know I was not doing my
13:26
best job or that I was struggling I'm
13:28
not struggling anymore this is a new new
13:31
me new chance new opportunity and I'm
13:34
not going to give up
13:36
so let me know in the comments if you've
13:38
had some of those day one nerves if it's
13:40
been a while for you since you finished
13:42
something and you feel
13:44
like you're ready to move forward
13:47
um
13:48
and that there's still a piece of you
13:50
that may not be quite as ready to keep
13:52
moving forward so I'm I'm gonna do this
13:54
let's set up this wall
13:57
oh
14:01
[Music]
14:06
foreign
14:08
[Music]
14:18
okay so I got some of my Act One Post-it
14:23
notes for one of the povs up here this
14:26
is mostly the current timeline that I'm
14:28
working on first and then I also have
14:31
taken some photos that I found on
14:33
Pinterest that remind me of like the
14:35
cabin they're in what some of the main
14:37
characters look like the front porch of
14:40
the cabin stuff like that the woods and
14:43
I what I like to do once I start to get
14:45
a feel for the book is I will put those
14:48
images up here I'm a super visual writer
14:51
and so if I can see those images along
14:54
with the words of what these you know
14:56
what the scene is and what's going on
14:58
then even if the image that I found is
15:00
not exactly what I see in my head it
15:03
does give me that kind of mood so I
15:06
really like that and it took me about 15
15:09
or 20 minutes I just printed on sticker
15:11
paper and so now I can just pull the
15:13
backing off and slap those up and it is
15:15
removable so if I need to move it to a
15:17
different part of the scene I can so
15:20
hopefully with this groundwork on act
15:23
one I can go ahead sit down and get some
15:26
words in
15:28
[Music]
15:44
so I have a couple of my little
15:45
characters here I don't have everybody
15:47
yet in terms of finding an actor and
15:49
then I've got some of the plot and a
15:53
little bit of fleshed out material here
15:55
and I'm feeling productive so okay it is
15:59
now 1 50 and I need to write so enough
16:05
of the procrasta planning
16:08
let's get to business let's do it
16:11
[Music]
16:32
[Music]
16:40
[Music]
16:43
foreign
16:48
[Music]
17:05
okay I did it I cannot believe it 28.83
17:09
word so just over the 2800 stretch goal
17:13
for the day that's a good start and it's
17:15
only 5 p.m our babysitter will be here
17:17
soon so I need to actually get ready and
17:20
get out of this uniform but I'm gonna
17:23
take these last five Little Gems and put
17:26
them in my little done pile
17:30
three four five so I ended up with 732
17:35
678 854 and 619 which is really above my
17:40
average so only four Sprints to get to
17:42
28.83 and I am thrilled so I'm on the
17:45
board I'm moving forward I ended up just
17:48
creating a separate uh Word document or
17:51
